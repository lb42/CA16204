At age eighteen, under her own name, Hayter wrote her first novel, <i>All Among the Barley</i> (1882), an insipid romance novel which <i>The Academy</i> opined, \"we hardly remember to have read a sillier book.\"  Her second novel <i>Poppy!</i> (1883) appeared under the name \"Mrs. Beresford\"&mdash;however, this may be a pseudonym since no record of a marriage (or husband) exists.  In 1885, Hayter married Lt. Arthur Forbes Montanaro, Royal Artillary, in India where they lived for a number of years.  (He would later become the governor of Sierra Leone.)  The couple had one daughter, Murial.  During this period she wrote two more novels: <i>A Romance of the Tape</i> (1893) and <i>A Social Scandal</i> (1893) (a story about gambling).

In 1911, they returned to London, married again, and lived as Mr. and Mrs. Ames.  Ames\'s wife, Kate, petitioned for a divorce in 1912 on grounds of desertion, bigamy, and adultery.  The divorce was granted since the divorce in Idaho had no validity.  The following year, both Hayter and Ames pled guilty to bigamy and she served six months in Halloway prison.  Afterwards, Wilson divorced Hayter and she married Ames.  Hayter remained an active writer of travel books, novels, and other nonfiction.

Helen Etough Gipps was born in 1830 in France, the only daughter of the Rev. George Crookshank, the vicar of Chigwell, Essex, and Amel Rosa Kelly.  Through her mother, she was the niece of attorney-general Sir Fitzroy Kelly (1796&ndash;1880) and grand-daughter of novelist Isabella Kelly (1759&ndash;1857).  After her father\'s death in 1833, her mother married Edwin Taynton, a captain in the Indian service who died in action in 1845.  In 1851, Gipps married Augustus Pemberton Gipps, the secretary of the patent department of the Kensington Museum.  Though the marriage began with affection, the couple briefly separated after the birth of a daughter Clara Fitzroy Gipps in July 1852.  They reunited and traveled on the continent where their son Alexander George Pemberton Gipps was born in September 1854.  Thereafter, husband and wife separated for good and Helen lived alternately with her mother in London and her brother in the country.  During this period, she met the Right Honorable William Wentworth Fitzwilliam Hume (1806&ndash;1892): he was a widower (since 1837), hugely wealthy (having inherited two million pounds from his uncle), and the conservative M.P. of Wicklow.  (In 1864, Hume legally changed his name to \"Hume Dick.\")  The two began an affair which her husband discovered in November 1860 and he petitioned for divorce the following spring.  During the trial, Hume offered Gipps £3000 to quash the case and a further £4000 to be paid later.  Gipps accepted and the divorce case was found in favor of Helen.  When the second payment failed to materialize, Gipps sued Hume in court (which failed) and petitioned again for divorce in 1862.  In the meantime, Helen gave birth to twin daughters, Helen Amelrosa and Williamina Emily Hume Dick (thereby confirming her adultery).  The judge in the second divorce proceeding ruled adultery had occurred but Gipps connived with the adultery by accepting the money in the first trial and by failing to take back his wife.  Gipps appealed to the House of Lords who affirmed the decision in 1864.  (There is no evidence if Augustus and Helen ever legally divorced.)  In the 1860s, supported no doubt by Hume, Helen divided her time between London, Thames Ditton, and Combe Royal (in Devon) and she began writing novels with <i>The World\'s Furniture</i> (1861).  She followed with a further six triple-deckers, the last, <i>Will is the Cause of Woe</i> (1878), was published posthumously.  None of her novels made much mark with the public or critics.  In addition, she wrote one travel book, <i>A Winter Tour in Spain</i> (1868).  Helen, due to the scandal perhaps, went by various surnames: Pemberton (her pseudonym), Hume, and Dick (though she never married Hume).  She died in 1877 in London.  Her twin daughters survived their mother\'s scandal: both were presented at court and both married well.

By the 1860s, the pair separated: Caroline asked for a judicial separation in 1867 (which does not seem to have been granted) after moving back to England with her sons and widowed mother.  Shortly afterwards, she began writing novels, presumably to support herself and her family, beginning with <i>Not While She Lives</i> (1870), a bigamy novel whose male protagonist is a novelist.  She followed this novel with over twenty others all published under the name Mrs. Alexander Fraser.  Meantime, her husband retired as a general in 1886 and returned to England where he set up house with Charlotte Monica Smith, a woman forty years his junior.  Alexander Fraser and Smith had two sons, and the birth of the first prompted another attempt at a judicial separation by Caroline in 1885 (which, again, does not seem to have been granted).

Russell turned to writing fiction, submitting stories to newspapers without success.  In 1870, she won a fiction prize competition sponsored by the <i>Newcastle Weekly Chronicle</i>.  The editor of the newspaper encouraged Russell and she wrote further stories.  The following year, in 1871, her father died.  Thereafter, Russell lived by her pen.  Moving to London in 1874, Russell published her first three-volume novel, <i>The Vicar\'s Governess</i> (1874), with the assistance of publisher George Routledge.

(Coincidently, Davis defended a breach of promise case later in his career in 1891.)

After her father\'s death in 1813, the Irish government asked for an account of the £1.5 million appropriated to him for recruiting.  As executrix Burdett was unable to provide one, and the case dragged on until 1824 when she settled with the government for £170,000.  In 1827, she published her first novel, <i>English Fashionables Abroad: A Novel</i>, or as one review called it, \"a tour, under the mask of a tale.\"  The book follows the travels of a group of English in Italy based on Burdett\'s own experiences.  The following year she wrote a sequel, <i>At Home: A Novel</i> (1828).  Burdett\'s husband died suddenly in Brighton in 1832 after a chemist\'s assistant mistakenly mislabeled oil of tar as his prescription.  Burdett wrote one later novel, <i>Walter Hamilton</i> (1846), whose eponymous protagonist is unjustly accused, tried, and condemned for fraud&mdash;likely based on the experiences of her father.

Her father inherited considerable estates in Durham and Northumberland and received a large income from coal mining.  William Burdon was a learned man: a graduate and fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge (BA 1786, MA 1788), and author of numerous works on literature and politics. The family divided its time between Hartford House, the newly constructed family estate near Morpeth, and a London home in Cavendish Square. Little is known of Hannah Dorothy Burdon\'s childhood or education.  Presumably, she lived comfortably and, judging by her later works, she received a significant education.  One memorial of her father reveals, to his children, \"he was an attentive parent; he took delight in their company, wrote books for their amusement, and personally superintended their education.\"   At the age of thirty-five, she turned to fiction, publishing the first of eight historical novels, <i>Seymour of Sudley: or, The Last of the Franciscans</i> (1838), all of which appeared under her maiden or married name. On 26 August 1841, in London, she married the Swiss landscape painter Johann Jakob Wolfensberger (1797&ndash;1850) and later moved with him to the continent. After the death of her husband in 1850, she abandoned the historical novel for the social-problem novel, beginning with <i>Masters and Workmen</i> (1851).  Inexplicably, for her latter six novels, she adopted the pseudonym \"Lord B&mdash;&mdash;\" or \"Lord B*******\" and maintained a clean break between her former and later works since the title pages make no reference to her earlier novels.  Due to this pseudonym, her later works were erroneously attributed to <a href=\"show_author.php?aid=1093\">Frederick Richard Chichester</a>, the Earl of Belfast.

(1766-1843), the Scottish chemist and inventor of the waterproof raincoat that bears his name.  After the death of his mother in 1824, Charles and his five siblings were left to the care of his maternal grandparents and his bachelor uncle General Alexander Fisher Macintosh.  After attending Eton, Charles bought a commission in the 15th Regiment, spent time in Canada as a soldier, and resigned his commission in 1846.  In 1843, he married his first cousin Amelia Elizabeth Horrocks and they had eleven children.  The couple spent their latter years mainly on the continent, settling first in Weimar, Germany, with his twin brother, John.  At this time, Charles turned to fiction, producing two novels: <i>Horace Grantham; or, The Neglected Son</i> (1852) and <i>A Brief Career; or, The Jew\'s Daughter</i> (1854).  The former novel draws heavily on Charles\'s own life, especially his childhood and his relationship with his father.  He died in Ostend, Belgium, in 1885.  Charles\'s younger brother, James Dunlop Horrocks, wrote an undistinguished collection of poetry, <i>Zeno, a Tale of the Italian War, and other Poems</i>.','<i>per inf</i> (Michael Demy-Geroe); Times (16 May 1885)'),

In 1852 Clacy went to Australia with her eldest brother Frederick in order to seek a fortune.  While there, she visited the gold fields and returned after two months.  On the boat home, Clacy gave birth to a daughter at sea.  (Clearly, the timing is suspicious: Clacy was likely pregnant before she landed in Australia.)  In 1854, she married Charles Berry Clacy (born 1820), a merchant\'s clerk and mining engineer.  By 1871, Clacy described herself as a widow.  After her return from Australia, she began an active literary career using the pseudonym \"Cycla\" beginning with <i>A Lady\'s Visit to the Gold Diggings of Australia in 1852&ndash;1853</i> (1853). Her novels include <i>Lights and Shadows of Australian Life</i> (1854), <i>Passing Clouds</i> (1858), and <i>Aunt Dorothy\'s Will</i> (1860).

He crammed for and failed the Indian Civil Service exam before heading to China as an assistant in the Chinese Maritime Customs in 1887.  Five years later he threw away his career by helping to fund and organize a Chinese rebellion: inspired by Byron, Mason had romantic notions about wanting a \"free and enlightened China.\"  In late 1891, he was arrested, tried, and convicted of arms smuggling.  After a year in prison, Mason returned to England in 1892 where he turned to literature under the pseudonyms \"Mr. M.\" and \"Julian Croskey\" (a name drawn from one of his Chinese colleagues).

None made much mark with the public, so Sparrow turned to journalism at which she initially excelled, appearing in a wide range of newspapers and magazines.  In particular, she went undercover in various lower-class neighborhoods and occupations.  By the turn of the century, she worked as a subeditor for various periodicals.

He trained as an architect and worked in that profession for fifteen years before turning to literature.  He wrote a scientific work <i>Reveries of World-History</i> (1893) before writing several children\'s works and five works of fiction.  The first, <i>The Beauty of Boscastle</i> (1893), was undistinguished.  His second novel, <i>Zalma</i> (1895), is an early work of science fiction in which the anarchist title character terrorizes London with anthrax delivered by airship.  A later novel <i>God is Love</i> (1898) caused an uproar when W. H. Smith refused to circulate it because they found the title (not necessarily the story) offensive.  In politics a Conservative, Ellis joined the Primrose League as an early member, helped found the halfpenny newspaper the <i>Evening News</i>, founded the War Emergency Committee in 1899, and unsuccessfully contested a parliament election against the Hon. Frederick Smith (heir of the Smith company) in 1900.  By the turn of the century, Ellis lived at Creek House, Shepperton-on-Thames, where he had many run-ins with his neighbor Lord Buchan.  In 1900, he married Elizabeth Mary Leigh Hayhurst, the second daughter of William Hayhurst of Billington.  The couple had one daughter.  Ellis founded and edited the short-lived poetry magazine <i>The Thrush</i> in the early years of the twentieth century.

From this point on, Judge seems to have kept his theatrical and legal lives rigorously separate.  For the former, he wrote, directed, and acted several plays, notably in connection with Sadler\'s Wells and the Alexandra in Southend-on-Sea.  His son William had a brief stage career before dying by accident in 1893.  Judge\'s own stage career faltered and he turned to fiction writing with <i>The Comedians\' Christmas Dinner</i> (1897) under the pseudonym \"Burford Delannoy.\"  He would go on to write a dozen-and-a-half detective stories.  Meantime, Judge\'s legal career prospered: in partnership with Horace Priestley, he represented numerous theatrical clients.  (The partnership of solicitors Judge and Priestley continue to this day.)  He died in 1931.  NB: Only one source identifies \"Burford Delannoy\" with Adolphus Eugene Judge but the connection, as unlikely as it sounds, seems legitimate.','British Census (1881, 1891, 1901, 1911); <i>Essex Newsman</i> (1 July 1893); Kemp; <i>The Literary Year-Book</i> (1911)'),

They all live on the Trewavas estate in Cornwall with Sir Hilton\'s grandmother, the proud Lady Trewavas.  Olive\'s father was English and her mother foreign (possibly Turkish)&mdash;this explains her dark features, passionate nature, and sometimes impish behavior.  Having grown up together, Sir Hilton and Olive love each other but Lady Trewavas convinces her grandson that Olive is not a proper wife for a baronet.  Instead, the grandmother has selected the conventional Eleanor Maristowe as a proper wife for her grandson.  Olive develops a strong antipathy to her rival and John falls in love with Eleanor himself (only sharing his secret with Olive).  Eventually, Sir Hilton proposes to Eleanor, though he doesn\'t love her.  As a result, John is heartbroken and Olive is told she must leave the estate on Eleanor\'s demand.  Various scenes follow&mdash;Hilton quarrels with Eleanor, Olive confronts Eleanor, John pleads with Hilton&mdash;but Sir Hilton and Eleanor are to marry and Olive must leave.  The next day, Charles Vigo (a neighboring squire who harbors his own love for Olive) sees an angry confrontation between Olive and Eleanor in the woods.  He watches Olive go then wanders the woods before finding Olive crying in a clearing.  He assists her back to the house where Eleanor is missing.  A search is begun: Vigo and his friend Damerel find the body of Eleanor drowned in a pool in the wood near where Olive argued with her.  The body\'s hands are tied with Olive\'s belt.  Vigo hides this evidence causing a rift with his friend.  Olive is accused of the crime (jealousy being her motive), but is not tried due to lack of evidence and Vigo\'s refusal to testify.  He then affects her escape from the neighborhood after proposing to her.  Vigo swears to find the killer (since he believes in Olive\'s innocence) with the help of the retired attorney Mr. Heriot.  Meantime, in Ireland, Olive works as a governess \"Miss Opal Vansittart\" for the heiress Florian Langley.  Damerel, by chance, catches sight of Olive from a train window which causes Olive to flee her employers in the middle of the night.  The characters converge in Paris: Sir Hilton searches for the missing John (who suffers from depression), Damerel follows Florian there, Vigo comes at the prompting of Florian, and Olive goes to hide in the Paris slums.  A family friend, Mrs. Gunning, finds Olive starving in a garrett.  Vigo, confirmed by Olive\'s story, solves the mystery of Eleanor\'s death: after her argument with Olive (where the latter dropped her belt), Eleanor met John who professed his love for his brother\'s fiance.  She rejected his addresses and the deranged man killed her with the belt.  (Olive suspected John\'s guilt and hid his crime.)  John dies of heart disease before he can be tried.  Olive returns to England.  Vigo releases her from their engagement so she can marry Sir Hilton and Vigo can marry Florian.','EC; Toronto'),

John Hanbury, a local country gentleman and horseman, becomes the target of his disdain because his good-natured affability grates on the cold reserve of Fermor.  Hanbury is in love with the quiet Violet Manuel, the youngest daughter of a Spanish widow and her dead English businessman husband.  The rivalry between Fermor and Hanbury culminates in a horse race where Fermor is injured in a fall caused inadvertently by Hanbury who goes on to win the race.  The injured Fermor is taken to the Manuel house to be tended since it is close to the race course.  Violet reveals her love for Fermor when she weeps at the bedside of the unconscious Fermor, witnessed by Hanbury.  Flattered by the girl\'s attentions and taken by her youth and beauty, Fermor undertakes to improve the adoring Violet and engages himself to her, though he contemptuously dismisses Violet\'s mother, sister Pauline, and brother Louis as low.  Meanwhile, a rich man named Carlay and his sheltered daughter Mary move in to the bungalow next door to the recuperating Fermor.  During his visits, Fermor discovers Mary to be more intelligent, well-read, and genteel than Violet and his interest correspondingly transfers from the latter to the former.  Hearing of his engagement to the penniless Violet, Fermor\'s mother Lady Laura Fermor arrives and through her arguments and the chance of a career-making position in India he precipitately leaves Eastport and Violet behind.  The jilted Violet, in spite of Hanbury\'s attentions, soon dies of a broken heart and Pauline and Louis swear to bring her \"murderer\" Fermor to justice.  A year passes: the position in India falls through and Fermor marries Mary and they return to London.  Louis and Pauline, now the center of an influential social circle, set about to destroy everyone involved with Violet\'s death.  Pauline exposes Major Carter (who facilitated Fermor\'s night time escape) as a poisoner who killed his wife for the insurance money; she sets a unscrupulous womanizer after Mary; she exposes the scandal in Lady Laura\'s past; and she herself leads on Fermor.  In spite of her success, Pauline suffers under the strain and attempts to stop her plans before they come to fruition.  However, her brother Louis, driven mad by his revenge, attacks Fermor.  Louis is institutionalized and the brain damaged Fermor survives, tended by his repentant wife.

A beauty, her family considers her promised to a childhood friend and fellow Englishman Frederick Randal.  While attending a royal procession, Helen meets Captain Maleenovsky, a dashing young Russian officer, whom she quickly grows to admire.  Her first ball, given by Anna Princess Donskaya, leads to the unwelcome advances of Prince Boriatinsky, an aged dandy&mdash;she rejects his marriage proposal, favoring the honorable Maleenovsky instead. Meantime, Maleenovsky\'s estate becomes embroiled in a lawsuit which he loses as a result of legal corruption.  Now a comparative pauper, he feels he can no longer court Helen and they part.  A subplot involves intrigues at the court of Emperor Alexander I between his dutiful wife and the scheming Anna.  The 1824 flood of the Neva River is graphically depicted, during which Maleenovsky rescues Helen from her collapsing house.  In order to recover from her ordeal, Helen\'s father sends his daughter to England for her health.  On board the ship, she is mercilessly harassed by Boriatinsky until rescued by Maleenovsky (who had concealed himself on board).  The ship wrecks and once again Maleenovsky saves Helen\'s life.  In England, Helen meets Mrs. Beresford (really Agnes Randel, Frederick\'s aunt) who takes her home and offers her protection.  Returning to Russia, Helen hears that Maleenovsky died in a duel with Boriatinsky.  However, he was seriously wounded, recovered, and returned to Russia where he is arrested as a conspirator in the Decembrist Revolt of 1825 (instigated by the death of Alexander I).  He is sentenced to death, but Helen works to get the sentence commuted to exile in Siberia.  Helen heroically follows Maleenovsky into exile where the two marry.  (Even the new Russian emperor is forced to pay homage to her determination.)  The novel ends in 1856 with the amnesty of the Decembrists.  Helen and Maleenovsky return to St. Petersburg and he regains his estate.','Bodleian; BL; EC'),

Told from the point of view of the adult Maud Ruthyn.

He is a follower of the Swedish mystic Emmanuel Swedenborg and entertains visits from his co-religionist, the mysterious Dr. Bryerly.  Austin\'s estranged younger brother is Silas Ruthyn: after living a dissolute life marked by scandal, he now lives a reclusive life as a sickly religious convert at his Derbyshire estate of Bartram-Haugh.  During his life, Austin has repeatedly paid his debts and allows him to occupy one of his properties as a symbol of his faith in his brother\'s honor.  Austin hires a French finishing governess named Madame de la Rougierre to educate his daughter&mdash;Maud quickly grows to distrust and fear her new governess who insists on questioning Maud about her father and taking long walks outside the grounds.  During two of these walks, Maud meets a mysterious man (who later is revealed to be her odious cousin Dudley) and later escapes being kidnapped.  Maud suspects, but cannot prove, that Madame planned these encounters.  Austin finally dismisses Madame when Maud witnesses the governess breaking into her father\'s desk.  When her father dies (for which he tries to prepare his daughter by hinting at a coming \"journey\"), the will leaves his fortune to Maud and names Silas as her guardian&mdash;another attempt by the eldest brother to repair Sila\'s reputation.  Austin\'s cousin, Monica, Lady Knollys, and Bryerly as trustee both attempt to convince Maud not to go to her uncle\'s house.  However Maud decides to go in order to fulfill her father\'s wishes.  Before she leaves, Monica tells Maud about Silas: as a young man he gambled, married a barmaid and had two children, and ran into debt.  A gambling partner named Charke, to whom Silas owed money, died at Silas\'s house in a locked room, presumably a suicide since no one could discover another way into the room.  Maud goes to Bartram-Haugh, a dilapidated and wild estate, and meets her relations: the laudanum-addict Uncle Silas, his uncouth daughter Milly, and his loutish son Dudley (whom Maud recognizes).  Clearly Silas suffers from financial problems and hopes to attain his ward\'s fortune.  Maud befriends Milly, teaches her better manners, and visits Monica (who lives nearby).  Surprisingly, Dudley proposes to Maud: she refuses him but Uncle Silas attempts to convince Maud to marry him.  He only drops the proposed marriage when Dudley reveals he has already married (herself a barmaid).  Thereafter, the isolation of Maud grows more menacing: Silas sends Milly away, he refuses to let Monica visit, and he confines Maud to the grounds.  More sinister, Madame de la Rougierre returns&mdash;Maud suddenly discovers the odious governess occupying a room in a disused part of the house.  Due to an impending action for debt, Silas decides to flee with Maud to France.  He sends her ahead in the custody of Madame, Madame drugs Maud, and they secretly return to Bartram-Haugh where Maud is locked in the very room where Charke died.  At night, Dudley sneaks into the room through a secret passage (thereby confirming the murder of Charke) and accidentally kills Madame.  Maud escapes death and Silas overdoses on laudanum.  She reports at the end her happy marriage to Lord Ilbury, a friend of her cousin.','EC; Wolff'),

Shortly after his birth, his parents separated: his father living at his estate Grasslands and circulating in London society as a wealthy novelist; and his mother living a retired life in a country house.  At the age of ten, Gerald moves to his father\'s house where he is introduced to his extended family, assumes his place as his father\'s heir, and attends Eton.  As he grows up, he becomes more sympathetic towards his father, rejects the narrowness of his mother\'s views, and assumes his place as a wealthy English gentleman in London society.  While stationed at Freshwater as an army officer, Gerald meets the beautiful, but sober, Ada Rivers who is escorting her younger step-siblings on a seaside holiday.  She is the daughter of divorced parents: her mother scandalously ran off with another man who then abandoned her.  Her father subsequently remarried, but the scandal follows her.  Gerald spends much time with Ada and eventually proposes only to be told she is already engaged to another man.  Heartbroken, Gerald throws himself into writing a novel which his father assists in publishing.  While at Grasslands, he becomes friendly with the two pretty daughters, Adelaide and Julia Sherman, of one of the local cottagers.  Though never more than a flirtation, the two women both fall in love with Gerald.  Soon after, Gerald\'s father dies leaving him a fortune and his estate.  Gerald travels for two years, writes another novel, and returns to London to live as a gentleman of means.  While in London, Gerald runs into Julia again: she pursues him and becomes his mistress.  During a visit to Grasslands, Gerald meets Ada at a neighbor\'s house.  She is now a widow with a one-year-old son.  Gerald renews his love-making but Ada only agrees to marry Gerald if he promises to live an honest and morally upright life.  He agrees to give up his bachelor lifestlye and he quietly pensions off Julia.  One evening, returning home, Gerald meets a mysterious woman who wishes to speak with him: she is Ada\'s mother who wants to learn about her daughter\'s life.  Gerald relays Ada\'s history and promises not to tell Ada he has met her.  To thank him, the mother gives Gerald a ring as a gift.  The next day, Ada sees the ring but Gerald feels bound not to tell who gave it to him.  Because of his apparent lack of honesty, she calls off their marriage.  Gerald angrily plans to leave England for Cairo&mdash;at the last moment, inexplicably, Julia arrives at Portsmouth to accompany him.  Gerald falls deathly ill in Egypt and Julia nurses him back to health&mdash;in recompense, Gerald marries his former mistress.  On their return to London, Gerald\'s family and friends refuse to see his wife and he regrets marrying Julia.  He learns that his cousin both prevented Ada\'s apology letter from reaching him at Portsmouth (she admits she overreacted) and he sent Julia to accompany him.  Gerald publicly thrashes his cousin, blaming him for ruining his life.  He meets Ada again (due to the death of her son) to sort out what happened, explain his disastrous marriage, and ask for her help in making Julia accepted in society as his wife.  Ada forgives him and visits Julia.  Time passes.  After Julia dies in childbirth, a chastened Ada and Gerald marry and live a quiet life at Grasslands.','BL; EC; Indiana'),

He is the organist at the cathedral and a composer of religious music&mdash;his current work in progress is an oratorio based on Jael.  David falls in love with Alice Grey, the orphan niece of the wealthy Mrs. Amiel Grey, the widow of the former dean.  Her sunny disposition contrasts greatly with the dour Scotsman but she greatly appreciates his musical abilities.  His poverty prevents him from professing his love.  Meantime, Janet answers an advertisement of a woman looking for a quiet residence and soon after the mysterious Mrs. Edenall arrives to board with them.  An minor cart accident after a picnic introduces the handsome Cuthbert Scrymgeour, the nephew of the snobbish Mrs. Scrymgeour, the relict of the former archdeacon.  Straight from university, he has ambitions, through his connections, of attaining a high position in the church.  Prodded by his aunt, Cuthbert woos Alice for her impending fortune.  David takes his completed oratorio to London where it becomes a musical sensation and makes his fortune.  Meantime back in St. Olave\'s, Cuthbert proposes to Alice and she tacitly accepts; however the marriage is delayed by the final illness of her aunt after a stroke.  During the fall music festival in the city, Mrs. Edenall sees Douglas Ramsay at a performance but he leaves town before she can confront him.  David, hearing of Alice\'s impending marriage, takes his oratorio to Germany.  Alice\'s aunt dies without a will, so the lawyers recall a relation, Captain Clay, from India to settle the estate.  A fatal accident brings the dying Douglas Ramsay to the Bruce house: his story finally comes out.  As a rich young man, he jilted the poor Janet and seduced Mrs. Edenall (whose real name is Marian Brandon) driving her mad and leaving her with a child.  His death deranges her mind again and she commits suicide.  Days before Alice\'s marriage, Captain Clay arrives with surprising news: Alice is no blood relation to Mrs. Grey and hence inherits nothing.  A letter among her aunt\'s papers clears Alice\'s history: she is the daughter of Ramsay and Marian, raised in ignorance of her birth by Mrs. Grey.  Cuthbert calls off the marriage.  Alice lives in poverty for a time before the now famous David returns to marry her.','BL: EC'),

The estate is situated near Lynncourt, the home of Lisle\'s wealthy spinster aunt Countess Renshawe, who reluctantly takes an interest in her nephew\'s family, especially the youngest daughter Esther (who is called \"Esty\" throughout).  Esty spends a great deal of her youth with her aunt roaming the estate and devouring the books in her library.  The eldest son, Gerald, joins the army where he (like his father) lives beyond his means.  There he meets Captain Geoffrey Adair, the son of a military man, who was raised in Italy by his widowed step-mother.  Sophy, a friend of his childhood, loves him, but she marries the middle-aged politician George Howard for his wealth and position.  Even after many years, she continues to pine for Geoffrey.  Inevitably, Geoffrey meets Esty and they fall in love under the watchful eye of Lady Renshawe.  Geoffrey proposes right before being called to join his regiment in India.  He entrusts Sophy with his secret and asks her to deliver his letters to Esty.  Out of jealousy, Sophy destroys his letters to Esty and conspires with Geoffrey\'s half-brother Alfred Cadogan to break up the couple.  Cadogan is the son of a Greek merchant and he now works as a financier and money-lender.  Cadogan and Sophy tell Esty that Geoffrey has married in India (even placing a marriage announcement in the <i>Indian Mail</i> to aid their deception).  Thinking herself abandoned, Esty marries Cadogan to free her brother Gerald from his crippling debts.  Cadogan marries Esty in anticipation of her inheriting Lynncourt, which Lady Renshawe suspects after catching him going through her papers.  (Her nephew will inherit her estate after all.)  Meantime, Geoffrey\'s year in India ends and he rushes back to re-unite with Esty suffering a shipwreck on the way.  The tearful reunion shows Esty\'s mistake in doubting Geoffrey and the confrontation between Geoffrey and Sophy exposes her duplicity.  Cadogan returns to Constantinople for business where one of his Turkish mistresses (out of jealousy) pays to have him killed.  Geoffrey secretly marries the newly-widowed Esty.  Before they reveal the news to her family, word comes that Cadogan has been found alive and is now speeding his way to England.  Esty, in despair, drowns herself in the pond at Gardenhurst.','EC'),

John North and Thomas Gass owned a factory and both made fortunes.  The works are now run by North\'s son Richard and Gass\'s widow.  North has three children by his first wife&mdash;the industrious Richard, the sickly Edmund, and the prudent Bessy&mdash;and two children by his vain and spendthrift second wife.  The imperious Mrs. North was the widow of Major Bohun and she has one son Captain Arthur Bohun from her first marriage.  Gass\'s sister married Captain Rane and went to India.  She (now as the widowed Mrs. Cumberland), her son Dr. Oliver Rane, and her ward Ellen Adair have returned to the town.  Inexplicably, Mrs. North has a prejudice against Dr. Rane, so she favors the surgeon Alexander and Rane\'s medical practice suffers.  At their births, Bessy North and Oliver Rane were entered into a tontine of newborns, ensuring a modest fortune for the last surviving child.  The novel begins with the death of Edmund North: after receiving an anonymous note exposing a co-signed note with Alexander, he lapses into a brain fever and dies.  When Rane accidently drops his pocketbook at Mrs. Gass\'s house, she finds a draft of the note among Rane\'s papers.  (Later Rane reveals he wrote the note to damage Alexander\'s reputation in the town.)  Shortly after the funeral, Rane marries Bessy with North\'s blessing and Mrs. North\'s wrath.  They learn shortly after that they are the last surviving members of the tontine&mdash;however, the money must wait for the death of one of them.  Meantime, Arthur falls in love with Ellen&mdash;in order to avoid his mother\'s interference, they plan to secretly wed in London.  She learns of the proposed wedding at the last moment and calls Arthur away.  She explains her opposition by telling him that Ellen\'s father William Adair is a convict who ruined his father and precipitated his suicide.  Meantime, the factory workers of the town join a trade union and strike for higher wages and shorter days.  The strike drags on for months as Richard reasons with the men to give up their demands.  Eventually, starvation and sickness affect the town and Richard eventually hires new workers from abroad.  (The depiction of the workers is rather unsympathetic&mdash;as many of the characters point out, the men get what they deserve due to their \"foolishness.\")  During the fever outbreak, Bessy herself dies of fever: her death appears mysterious due to the rapidity of the burial and the appearance of her ghost to a servant.  After Mrs. North instigates an inquest (as a means of further tormenting the doctor), Rane confesses that he and Bessy conspired to fake her death as means of getting the tontine money and emigrating to America, which they do soon after.  Due to her jilting, Ellen fades away.  The return of her father from Australia reveals the truth: William Adair and Major Bohun were best friends in India but Mrs. North was a gambler who incurred huge debts.  She forged promissory notes in her husband\'s and Adair\'s names.  The scandal is kept quiet, but Major Bohun destroys himself in shame.  A chastened Arthur renews his love with Ellen but too late.  Richard loses money due to the strike but avoids bankruptcy.  He ends by marrying a rich heiress.','EC'),

The story opens on a crisis: on the next day during the market, there will be a run on the bank.  The chief clerk attempts to track down the current manager John Vernon but is unable to find him since he has fled town knowing the bank will collapse due to his speculating.  His cousin, the domineering Catherine Vernon, steps in and saves the bank with her personal fortune.  From that moment, Catherine becomes the head of the family bank.  Twenty years pass.  Catherine, now in her sixties, recruits two distant cousins to manage the bank: Harry Vernon and Edward Vernon.  The latter is her personal favorite, whom she treats as if he were her son.  Catherine also maintains an almshouse for her impoverished relatives&mdash;the new arrivals are Mrs. John Vernon (now a widow) and her daughter Hester.  At their first meeting, Catherine and Hester become antagonists since Hester\'s pride (and lack of knowledge about her father\'s failure) keeps her from showing due deference to Catherine.  The kind-hearted but unimaginative Harry unsuccessfully woos Hester.  Edward finds himself drawn to Hester, but chafes under Catherine\'s strictures and prejudice against Hester.  In order to free himself from the bank and Catherine\'s control, he begins speculating with the bank\'s funds hoping to make an independent fortune.  Events come to a crisis when Edward loses the bank\'s money and he asks Hester to elope with him.  Finally told of her father\'s similar flight years earlier, Hester refuses to go with Edward who flees alone.  Working together, Hester, Catherine, and Harry save the bank at great personal cost.','EC'),

Kelly, the son of a provincial mother, moves to London to make his way as a writer.  He first stays with his relation Matthew Donagh, a dandified self-proclaimed journalist (though actually an advertising canvasser), but receives no help from the self-centered man.  Instead, he makes the acquaintance of the bohemian Dawton family through a comic accident and enters the world of journalism specializing in essays on slum life.  He eventually rises to become an editor and novelist after marrying a wealthy wife.  Glenarva travels with her widowed father: the owner of the Glenarva estate, he no longer has the funds to maintain it after a failed investment.  His daughter hopes to become a novelist to repair his fortunes.  Her juvenile works meet with a cold response from the publisher Vassett (based on the real-life Newby) but the publisher encourages her efforts and Glenarva eventually publishes her first novel.  In the meantime, she and her father meet the struggling businessman Mr. Lacere.  After the death of her father, Glenarva marries Lacere and she works to support his business.  Fame comes first with the novel <i>Ashtree Manor</i> and fortune comes second with the switch to the new pushing publisher Felton and Laplash (based on Tinsley Brothers).  Thereafter, she circulates in literary circles with fellow authors, editors, and publishers but her writing devolves into sentimental potboilers.  Glenarva eventually suffers a breakdown.  While living in the country, she reassesses her career and returns to the type of books that made her fame.  Unfortunately, her husband dies suddenly.  The novel ends with Glenarva rejecting a marriage offer from a long-time friend.  Riddell based the book on her own experiences as an author.','BL; EC'),

She was found drowned in her estate\'s boathouse after she, her maid Sophia Kirby, and a groomsman went missing.  Sir Gilbert Linton was tried for murder and acquitted when it is revealed that Lady Linton was an alcoholic from before her marriage and Sir Gilbert withdrew her from society for her health and reputation.  It was during her attempt to escape her nurses that she drowned accidentally.  After the death, Sir Gilbert quickly remarries, the \"little Lady Linton\" of the title.  The novel then recounts the past through the new Lady Linton\'s diaries, copied by Pierce\'s partner and wife.  Gertie Graham grew up in Neufbourg with her English father, an author of a cosmographical dictionary.  After his death, she travels with her nurse to London to sell his manuscript, her only inheritance.  She finds an Englishman named John Brown (really Sir Gilbert) to take her across the channel in his yacht (since her nurse has a fear of steam ships) and the two have a number of long conversations.  Their friendship continues in London: Gertie fails to sell her father\'s manuscript, Sir Gilbert assists her in finding lodgings, and Gertie eventually take a position as governess to Mr. and Mrs. Gower\'s four daughters (arranged secretly by Sir Gilbert).  (The first Lady Linton was the daughter of Mrs. Gower\'s first marriage; three of the remaining daughters are from Mr. Gower\'s first marriage.)  Gertie discovers the identity of her John Brown&mdash;their meeting leads the still-married Sir Gilbert to ask Gertie to elope with him which Gertie refuses.  In any case, Gertie loses her governess position.  She goes to live with Mr. Gower\'s mother-in-law who operates a Kensington bake shop.  A year later, Lady Linton dies and Sir Gilbert\'s is tried and acquitted.  She hears that he plans to leave the country so she rushes to his side and proposes to him.  Sir Gilbert and \"little Lady Linton\" cruise in his yacht and end up renting a house in the French countryside.  Meantime, Mrs. Pierce, as Gertie\'s maid, spies and reports to her husband and Mrs. Gower.  The arrival of Miss Drummond disrupts their happy life: she is an old friend of Sir Gilbert\'s youth and her behavior grates on Gertie but Sir Gilbert seems powerless to stop her.  Mrs. Pierce suspects Miss Drummond is Sophie Kirby back to blackmail Sir Gilbert.  The novel comes to a climax in England: Mrs. Gower confronts Sir Gilbert in the presence of Miss Drummond convinced the two conspired to kill her daughter.  Instead, she meets her own daughter who confesses she killed Sophia.  When the police arrive to arrest her, the old Lady Linton shoots herself.  Mrs. Gower goes mad and later kills herself; Sir Gilbert and Gertie remarry (the first marriage being bigamous); and the Pierces retire from detective work.','EC'),

Her disgust centers on the political economy she learns at college: \"a so-called science\" that \"treated of men and women as skittles.\"  She plans to move to the neighborhood of her brewery and disguising herself as a dressmaker.  The second central character Harry Goslett has been raised by Lord Jocelyn Le Breton in ignorance of his true birth: Lord Jocelyn has taken the orphan boy away from his Uncle Bunker in order to bring him up as a gentleman.  When Lord Jocelyn tells Harry that his father was a poor sergeant from the East End, Harry decides to return and see from whence he came.  Both Angela and Harry&mdash;the former disguised as a dressmaker named Miss Kennedy and the latter disguised as a cabinet maker,&mdash;unknown to each other, move to the same East End boarding house, Mrs. Bormalack\'s, where they mingle with a cast of eccentric characters: Lord and Lady Davenant, two Americans pressing a royal claim; the Professor, a magician; Daniel Fagg, an Australian shoemaker working on a scholarly book on the ancient alphabet; Josephus Coppin, Harry\'s cousin who works at the brewery and lives under a cloud of scandal involving some missing money; and Mr. Maliphant, an old, senile ship\'s figures carver.  Using her great wealth surreptitiously, Angela, as Miss Kennedy, opens an idealistic Dressmakers\' Association: she organizes the work day around generous \"play\" breaks at lawn tennis and gymnastics, a free dinner, and cultural improvement in the evenings where she teaches the girls music, singing, and dancing.  Angela has secretly financed the entire operation through the beneficence of \"Miss Messenger,\" who not only provides the building but also places her considerable dress orders there.  The goal of the operation, according to Angela, is to make the girls discontent: by showing them a higher culture, they will strive to improve.  In her conversations with Harry, Angela resolves on another, more ambitious project: a Palace of Delight.  In a moment of \"what if,\" Harry offers the Palace as the solution to the social problems of the East End which, continuing the fantasy, he and Angela draw up in a prospectus.  Angela takes this plan and, as Miss Messenger, charges her lawyers and an architect to build it secretly in the neighborhood.  Between starting the construction of the Palace of Delight and opening it, Angela again surreptitiously uses her wealth to solve some of her fellow boarders\' problems.  She gets Harry a well-compensated job as a cabinet maker in her brewery; she finances the claim of the Davenants and puts them up in her Portman Square mansion; and she finances the writing of Danial Fagg\'s book and publishes it.  Meantime, Harry discovers the missing money and a deed that both removes the scandal from his cousin Josephus and shows that his Uncle Bunker has cheated Harry out of some East End property (conveniently the very house that Angela uses for her Dressmakers\' Association).  Predictably, Harry and Angela fall in love, and Angela arranges their marriage to coincide with the grand opening of the Palace of Delight.  At the ceremony she reveals her identity to the surprised Harry and she gives the Palace of Delight to the people of the neighborhood.  The novel ends happily with the narrator\'s editorial comment, \"The Palace of Delight is in working order now, and Stepney is already transformed.  For the first time they understood that life may be happy: for the first time they ressolved that they would find out for themselves the secret of happiness.\"  The novel inspired the real-life People\'s Palace of East London a few years later.\r','BL; EC; Sutherland'),

Because of the unequal marriage, the Sharlands disown Edwin who is left to raise his daughter on his own after the death of his wife in childbirth.  After Edwin\'s death, Grace is left a small inheritance and goes to live in a nearby town Up Holland with her former servants in a farmhouse.  Taught music by her father, she teaches in Danver to support herself.  Grace comes to know her landlord, William Lovering, a proud and taciturn man who works alongside his employees on his estate.  The forty-year-old Lovering lives with his two elder spinster sisters, the twins Miriam and Naomi.  Through visits, meetings in the fields, and parties at his house, the two fall in love.  On a trip to Brighton, Lovering proposes and the two secretly marry in London.  During their honeymoon at Box Hill, Grace discovers the name \"Rose Russell\" scratched into the window glass&mdash;the name inexplicably upsets Lovering.  On her return to Up Holland, Lovering\'s sisters, ignorant of the marriage, warn Grace to not fall in love with their brother because he is already married.  Confronted, Lovering confesses to a youthful marriage with a nurse-maid named Rose Russell who has subsequently run away.  As a result of his confession, Grace flees to London where she supports herself as a musician and street singer.  During one of her engagements at Lady Fane\'s country house, she meets a servant named Rachel Rock who reveals (while sleepwalking!) her actual identity at Rose Russell.  Grace returns to London with this secret.  A short time later, she learns of an inheritance of £15,000 from her father\'s family and the death of Rose Russell.  Grace returns to Up Holland and discovers Lovering has gone mad due to the loss of Grace.  In an affecting scene, she visits him in his Yorkshire asylum.  Grace lives out the rest of her life alone.

Her practice initially thrives at the expense of the older Dr. Fullagher, a misanthrope, because the townspeople take to the novelty of a woman doctor.  In revenge, he invites a younger doctor, Austin Fane, to take over his practice.  Fane accepts and makes clear his contempt for women doctors though his words and refusal to consult with her.  The townspeople, save Miss Jacques (the retired teacher) and Mrs. Stanforth (the clergyman\'s wife), shift their loyalties to the handsome new doctor.  Fane\'s sister Sibyl comes to visit and she renews an acquaintance with Oscar Ardley, drawing the man\'s attentions away from Winifred.  Sibyl, a flirt, has no intention of anything lasting with Oscar.  Fane, meantime, drifts into an engagement with Violet Lorimer, a wealthy young woman.  Her practice drying up, Edith suffers mentally and financially.  Through happenstance, months pass before Fane first sees his medical rival and he is instantly struck by her beauty though worn by care.  He immediately repents of his harsh words and he contrives to meet her by calling her in to assist during a factory accident.  During a music concert, some workmen, instigated by the drunkard Nicholson, hiss at Edith.  Fane takes Nicholson outside and knocks him down, thereby earning the man\'s enmity.  The doctor\'s explanation to Edith of the event leads to Edith\'s breakdown and brain fever.  Fullagher attends Edith back to health, now aware of Fane\'s regard for Edith.  Edith, for her part, hears of Fane\'s attention, suspects his love, and begins to feel love for him.  After her recovery, Fane confesses his love to Edith, who rejects him due to his previous engagement.  The impasse is resolved when Nicholson, intending mischief, tells Violet about Fane\'s attentions to Edith.  She sacrifices her own happiness and breaks off the engagement allowing Fane to propose to Edith.  Sibyl throws over Oscar for another and the chastened Oscar successfully begs Winifred\'s forgiveness and hand in marriage.','Bodleian; BL; EC'),

Lord Ennisford is a handsome and fashionable man-about-town&mdash;a \"worshipper of beauty,\" he is noted flirt in society.  Lady Frances is a retiring, soulful, and plain woman who Ennisford proposed to after a weekend meeting.  The marriage enrages Bella Grant, Ennisford\'s cousin and past lover.  The pair live happily for a time at their country estate Highcliffe Towers.  The honeymoon ends with the birth of a son, Lord Chester, a colicky baby that annoys Ennisford and that fills the attention of Lady Ennisford.  The situation leads Ennisford back into society without his wife.  He enlists his cousin Bella, now a confirmed spinster, to come assist his wife and son and she torments the young wife.  After a daughter May is born, Ennisford attempts to reconnect with his wife by taking her to Paris.  While there, Ennisford meets his half-brother Bertie, a young man working as a diplomat in Vienna.  Bertie has fallen madly in love with Lady Aylmer, a \"grass widow\" of an older husband in India.  She is rich, beautiful, and charming, and she unscrupulously ensnares Ennisford.  Back in England, their dalliance continues to the horror of Lady Ennisford, Bella, and Bertie.  Each, at some time, attempts to turn Ennisford away from Lady Aylmer.  Totally besotted, Ennisford spurns them.  Even Lady Ennisford\'s direct appeal to Lady Aylmer fails.  The situation climaxes when Ennisford invites his lover to Highcliffe Towers and his wife refuses to acknowledge her rival and insults her publicly.  Bella, now in sympathy with Lady Ennisford, attempts to poison Ennisford, accidently killing the valet instead.  Her failure leads to her sending proofs of Lady Aylmer\'s unfaithfulness to her husband in India.  He returns and sues for divorce: uncontested, Ennisford and Lady Aylmer flee to the continent.  The love-spurned Bertie kills himself.  After six months, the relationship between Ennisford and Lady Aylmer sours and she leaves him for an Austrian count.  Repentant and bitter, Ennisford returns to England where he learns of his brother\'s death.  The news precipitates a stroke.  Partially paralyzed, Ennisford returns to Highcliffe Towers where he is tearfully reunited with his wife.  Bella ends her days in a lunatic asylum.','EC'),

She confesses to Barrington Eyre, a rich landowner, that the child she drowned belonged to her mistress and she came to Lovel to find the father.  As a young man, Eyre lived a debauched life (much like his father) and seduced a young woman named Hester Clarke.  It is their illegitimate child who was drowned.  Eyre repented of his ways and married \"Madcap,\" a beautiful but childish woman.  In the past, Frank, Lord Lovel, loved her and continues to harbor affection for her.  When he returns from years of travel, he learns to his regret that she has married Eyre.  Hester, after reading about the case in the newspapers, comes to Lovel to see Janet who confesses to her the negligent death of the child.  By chance, Hester meets Madcap and her son Dody&mdash;the resemblance between Dody and her own dead child unhinges her.  Madcap\'s suspicions about her husband disappear when Frank lies that he is the dead child\'s father (his motive is to protect Madcap from pain).  Eyre thanks Frank for his deceit and attempts to get Hester to leave the neighborhood but she has taken an unhealthy interest in Dody.  Time passes and Eyre lives in fear that Hester will confess the truth to Madcap.  One night after dinner with Eyre and Frank, Madcap is found stabbed.  She lives long enough to give birth to a daughter before dying.  The sickly Dody dies shortly after.  Hester is arrested for the murder since she was seen at the house visiting the ill Dody.  At the trial, the evidence is all circumstantial and Eyre is forced on the stand to admit Hester was his mistress.  (Most of the town find Eyre\'s behavior contemptible, especially his silence on Frank\'s part.)  The jury finds Hester not guilty.  The novel ends with the disappearance of Frank and Hester from the town.  Mathers wrote a sequel, <i>Eyre\'s Acquittal</i> (1884).','BL; EC'),

Her absent father much prefers society, abroad and in the country, than the company of his daughter.  Violet\'s only friend is George Vereker, a distant cousin and painter.  George entertains the thought of one day marrying Violet, but his finances will probably never allow it.  Mr. Yorke marries while in France and brings home a rich wife and a step-daughter Esmee Verner.  Violet, used to her independence, chafes under the guidance of the new Mrs. Yorke.  Through George, Violet meets Regy Charteris, a handsome man newly come into property.  He immediately falls in love with Violet.  During a visit to his country house, he rashly kisses Violet&mdash;she forgives him, but the action leads to much confusion on both sides.  One winter night, after an argument with her step-mother, Violet flees the home and goes to George to find him out of the country.  Regy, who happens to be there at the same time, takes Violet to his sister\'s house.  To protect her reputation and because he loves her, Regy proposes and the two are quickly married.  Violet agrees in order to escape her home though she admittedly does not love Regy.  The rest of the novel chronicles Violet\'s growing feelings for Regy, her rejection of George (who pursues her in spite of her marriage), and her eventual confession of her love to Regy.  A subplot involves Esmee\'s choice between the impoverished but charming Charlie Clinton and the staid Sir Edward Farquhar.  She initially accepts Farquhar for his position but breaks off the match after a near-fatal illness forces her to confess her true feeling for Charlie.','EC'),

Dymphna (\"Dym\") Elliott at eighteen works as a governess for the youngest daughter of the Tressilian family.  She has a \"temper\" leading her to speak the truth when silence is the better course.  Dym\'s brother, William, suffers from poor health and works as a curate in a poor Kentish Town parish.  While at the Tressilian house, Dym meets Guy Chichester, a wealthy and mercurial cousin of the family, and she earns his gratitude by nursing him through a migraine headache.  Beatrix Tressilian, the eldest daughter, develops an antipathy to Dym which leads to her removal.  Living with her brother, Dym learns of the mysterious Mr. Latimer who periodically comes to the parish to assist her brother&mdash;he turns out to be none other than Guy Chichester himself.  The latter hires Dym as his mother\'s companion on his estate Ingleside in Yorkshire.  While there, Dym learns of Mrs. Chichester\'s impending blindness due to cataracts (which she is hiding from her son), falls in love with Guy, and meets the angelic Honor Nethecote.  The latter, as Dym learns, is an old love of Guy\'s and the betrothed couple separated due to a disagreement.  Dym quickly comes to admire and imitate the benevolent Honor.  Meantime, Honor\'s brother Humphrey, a stolid farmer, falls in love with Dym but she turns down his proposal.  Beatrix arrives at the house, sees Dym\'s affection for her cousin, and sets about getting Dym removed.  Her plan succeeds: Dym tenders her resignation but before she goes she meets with an accident when she twists her ankle and lies in a cold, damp field for hours.  Honor finds Dym and Guy saves both.  The exposure, however, affects both women but both eventually recover.  As a result, Guy and Honor reunite, marry, and go on a honeymoon.  Dym stays on at Ingleside.  While in France, Honor gives birth to a daughter Florence and dies shortly after.  Crushed, Guy sends the infant to his mother and goes on an extended trip around the world.  A year later, they hear of the wreck of his ship and Guy is presumed dead.  Mrs. Chichester and Dym raise the girl.  Meantime, William also dies after years of poor health.  One night Dym answers the door to a disheveled man&mdash;it is Guy miraculously returned (he never explains how he escaped death).  The trio make a family of sorts: Florence adores both her father and her \"aunt\" Dym.  Though he admits Honor was his true love, he proposes to Dym and she accepts.  However, Beatrix, once again, sows seeds of doubt in Dym who thinks Guy is marrying her out of pity not affection.  Dym runs away.  She only returns to Ingleside to nurse Guy after a severe riding accident.  After his recovery, he proposes again affirming his affection for her and Dym accepts.','EC'),

Years earlier, her father left his professorship at Cambridge to live near the sea for his wife\'s health but remained after her death.  Dora assists her father by making scientific woodcuts to illustrate his books.  When she is eighteen, she meets the sea captain Rae Morrison.  He returns a year later and stays in the village for a few months spending most of his time with Dora&mdash;and the two fall in love.  However, Morrison leaves at the end of his vacation without saying goodbye to Dora.  Her father reveals that Morrison asked for her hand but he refused since Morrison did not have a settled life and Dora was too young.  (Though the actual reason seems to be her father\'s fear of losing her.)  Dora\'s mood improves with the arrival of the widow Mrs. Wear and her young daughter Eglantine.  Over the next few years, Dora\'s aunt Lois dies, Dora contracts smallpox, and Dora\'s father loses his investments after a bank fails.  The biggest change comes when coal and iron are discovered on the neighboring estate and the town sees an influx of miners and their families.  In addition, the architect Mr. Surbiton and his widowed sister Mrs. Ullathorne move to the town as well&mdash;the latter is a class-conscious social butterfly with two children Ted and Birdie.  Another new arrival is the clergyman John Elphinston serving as a curate for the absent rector.  His earnest sermons (hinted as being Low Church in content) attract the workmen of the town and scandalize the upper crust.  Elphinston boards with Dora and her father where he comes to meet Eglantine.  They fall in love and eventually marry when Elphinston get the Cove Rossington living.  Morrison eventually returns after retiring and, at age thirty three, Dora marries him.','EC');

In order to keep his superior employee close, Marsh throws John in the way of his maid Joan. John and Joan marry and have eleven children, all while still living on thirteen shillings a week.  Suffering grinding poverty, John picks up a dead hare in the road (placed there as a trap by the squire\'s gamekeeper who has a personal animosity against John) and he is sent to prison for three months for poaching by Sir Andrew Aveling.  Joan, in despair and nine-months pregnant, attempts to walk to town to see her husband.  She collapses in the road: found by a carter, she is taken to the Chertsey workhouse where she gives birth to Florence (\"Folly\") and dies anonymously.  John returns from prison to find his wife gone and his children dispersed, so he heads to London for work.  Meantime, Folly spends her early years in the workhouse before being adopted by a retired dancer Tom Fernandez and his wife.  Through them, Folly learns to dance and perform.  At eighteen, after the deaths of her adopted parents, Folly moves to London where she quickly becomes a popular success as a dancer.  The novel then introduces the Vicar of St. Barnabas Richard Vane, his sister Margaret (\"Madge\"), and Roland Aveling, the son of Sir Andrew.  Roland proposes to Madge, but Sir Andrew is against the match due to his class prejudice against his vicar and his sister.  He convinces and funds Roland to spend a year in London seeing the world hoping his son will forget about Madge.  While there, Roland comes under the thrall of Folly who he showers with gifts and attention.  Soon after, Folly meets her father, now a broken-down alcoholic, and she takes him in.  While caring for her father, she hears about her past and formulates a hatred for Sir Andrew.  Based on the morality of \"an eye for an eye,\" she plans to entrap an unsuspecting Roland into marriage in order to revenge her family.  Prompted by Vane, Roland breaks off with Madge and does marry Folly.  On the day of the marriage, she confesses to Roland and Sir Andrew and presents her bed-ridden father to them.  A greatly chastened Sir Andrew offers Folly and her father compensation which she refuses.  Vane, who has given up his living and moved to the slums of London due to his republican sympathies, councils Folly to see the error of her actions and helps her through the difficult death of her father.  Folly develops a hopeless and secret love for the honorable clergyman.  After her father\'s death, Folly moves to Paris where she is not the performer she once was.  Meantime, Madge, who assists her brother in the slums, engages herself to the older French painter Amadis Garnier, a friend of Sir Andrew.  After the disaster of the Franco-Prussian war and the siege of Paris (where Folly is trapped), Vane and Madge go to Paris to assist the new republic.  Vane dies fighting on behalf of the commune.  Garnier is revealed a double-dealing spy.  Folly\'s last action is to shoot Garnier to save Vane\'s sister and Folly dies hugging the dead body of Vane.','BL; EC'),

The eldest Dudley resides in India; Julia and Meggie live at home; and the debt-prone Bob works in his father\'s office.  A daily governess Faith Lurgan looks after the three younger children: Gertrude, Bernard, and Cecil.  As the narrator describes, Faith \"was moderate in all things&mdash;expectations, appearance, temper, appetite&mdash;all save patience.  Of that, Miss Lurgan had an immoderate supply.\"  In youth, she and Dudley \"loved innocently and sweetly\" but his father demanded he marry a Jamaican heiress.  When Dudley refuses, Yelverton disowned his son, and Dudley goes to India to seek a fortune.  At a ball, Meggie meets Col. Burke Dundas: though he is a poor officer, he is heir to a title.  The two fall in love.  Yelverton refuses to let his daughter marry the poor Dundas; instead he wants Meggie to marry Mr. Kenney, an uncouth merchant.  Dundas inexplicable breaks his engagement with Meggie&dash;later it is revealed that Yelverton told Dundas that Meggie accepted Kenney\'s proposal (though she never does).  Soon after, Meggie learns of Dundas engagement with the beautiful and rich Ida Grant, the daughter of an English Jew (with hints he is a money-lender).  Faith accompanies Meggie to London to see the wedding, an event that nearly drives Meggie to suicide.  Six years pass.  Yelverton goes bankrupt and dies of a stroke, leaving his family nearly penniless.  Meggie takes a job as governesses for Lady Castleton, a fat, demented alcoholic, looked after by Miss Blacklock.  Meggie suddenly meets Lord Castleton one day and discovers her employer is Dundas.  He confesses to Meggie he married for money thinking she had accepted Kenney.  His wife, once beautiful, has degenerated (with hints at a crude anti-semeticism cause).  Meggie agrees to stay, for the child\'s sake.  After a time, Lady Castleton succumbs to her addiction, Meggie marries Dundas, and Faith comes to Felton to be the governess.  One night, a disheveled Ida Grant breaks into the house.  Dundas reveals he locked his wife away in order to marry Meggie.  The distraught Meggie leaves her husband to his first wife.  The novel ends with the return of Dudley from India: on route, the ship catches fire and Dudley dies saving a blind boy.  Faith and Meggie both remain tragically alone.','BL; EC'),

Her mother was an actress under the name of \"Olivia Pitt\" who ran off with the Hon. Frank St. Barnard: the two were allegedly married in France before Frank abandoned the pregnant Olivia.  Shortly after giving birth in Boulogne, she died of smallpox.  Now seventeen and a beauty, Mary gains the attention of two men: the nouveau riche Philip Ransford and the poorer Tom Mayfield.  Whereas the latter\'s intentions are completely honorable, Ransford\'s are not: he plies her with expensive gifts and letters behind her grandfather\'s back while trying to induce her to run away with him.  She refuses.  The title of the novel comes from the bust of Clytie owned by Mayfield&mdash;her likeness to Mary leads to much soliloquizing by the young man.  Mayfield thwarts Ransford by telling Weller of his attentions to his granddaughter.  Mary chafes under her grandfather\'s distrustful gaze and leaves town alone for London where she plans to follow her mother on the stage.  (The night she leaves, there is some confusion about whether she left with Mayfield or Ransford.)  In London, Mary inadvertently (and briefly) goes into a house of ill repute before being rescued by a kindly police officer who brings her to the respectable Breeze family where she boards.  Her grandfather arrives in London and dies before finding her.  While attempting to become an actress, Mary comes across Ransford who pursues her again.  On the night she is to debut on stage, the company goes bankrupt and she learns she has inherited a small fortune from her paternal grandfather Lord St. Barnard.  Four years pass.  During that time Ransford has lost his fortune, Mary has married Lord St. Barnard (the nephew for the last lord), and Mayfield has gone to the goldfields of California.  Mayfield returns to London as the wealthy poet of the Sierras \"Hugh Kalmat\" in time to see Ransford\'s attempt to blackmail the St. Barnards lead to a libel prosecution by the peer.  The highly publicized case features a lengthly cross-examination of Mary by Ransford\'s unscrupulous barrister Simon Cuffing in which he insinuates numerous stains on her honor related to her parentage, her running away from home, and her time on stage.  The grueling five-day questioning&mdash;described as \"legal torture\" in the text&mdash;causes Mary to break down and flee England.  Mayfield, working anonymously, finds proofs of her parent\'s marriage and her birth.  Ransford, in a moment of conscience and greed, agrees to repudiate his slanders on Mary in exchange for ten thousand pounds.  Mayfield confronts Ransford, challenges him to a duel, and kills the villain after Ransford dishonorably fires early.  The murder, due to Cuffing\'s cover up, is adjudged a suicide.  Lord and Lady St. Barnard go on to live a happy life and Mayfield returns to America.  The court case at the center of the novel is based on the real-life libel case of Sir Travers Twiss in 1872.','EC'),

Gabriel is the chief suspect but he escapes from jail and flees to America with the help of Margaret Territ, a cottager.  Old Myddelton\'s fortune is left to his only sister, Lady Lawrence, who lives in India.  The novel follows the lives of Old Myddelton\'s extended family, all of whom look forward to inheriting a part of the fortune on the death of Lady Lawrence.  The good Honor Craven and her flighty cousin Phoebe Owen, two poor orphans, live with their guardian, another cousin Lawrence Houghton.  The imperious Houghton, a lawyer, pursues Honor but she does not return his affection.  More cousins, the snobby Mrs. Trent and her daughter Theodora, live close by Honor; another cousin, Capt. Hervey Lawrence Trent, is a frequent visitor.  Into this world comes two new faces: the wealthy traveler Royden Keith and the poor widow Mrs. Payte.  The former takes an interest in the history of the family, especially the murder of Old Myddelton and the fate of Gabriel.   Mrs. Payte lives with her invalid companion Mrs. Disbrowe, and ingratiates herself with the family.  Honor befriends Mrs. Payte, to the chagrin of her family, and helps to nurse Mrs. Disbrowe.

On arriving in London, Honor and the family meet Lady Lawrence and are shocked to discover that she has disguised herself as Mrs. Payte in order to find out the true natures of her family.  Besides token amounts, she leaves the fortune to Honor knowing she will use it wisely.  Lady Lawrence introduces Honor to society before she dies and leave everything to Honor.  She quickly becomes a target of fortune hunters.  Meantime, Royden investigates the murder of Old Myddelton, eventually tracking down Margaret Territ who confesses that her father was the true murderer.  Armed with her confession, Royden makes a desperate ride home to share the news with Gabriel\'s wife who he has been hiding in his home.

The devious Portuguese Ribeiro discovers Lacoste\'s secret: that he is the Englishman George Evans, an accused murderer and exile from his native land.  Ribeiro uses the secret to blackmail Lacoste into giving his daughter in marriage.  Rather than relent, Lacoste commits suicide, leaving a letter to his daughter explaining his past and asserting his innocence.  Leona swears to clear her father\'s name.  She follows her friend (and lover) Christobal Valera, a Spanish gentleman, to New York to both flee Ribeiro and to make her way in the world.  A born actress, she disguises herself as a man named Leon d\'Acosta on the steamship which Christobal discovers.  In New York, Leona goes on stage and finds success as an actress.  There, she discovers her uncle, Henry Evans, still owns a large business in Liverpool and London, which, coincidently, Christobal has business.  Taking advantage of his bout with typhoid fever, Leona takes his letter of introduction to Evans and disguises herself as Christobal.  In London, she lives as a guest of the Evans\'s family: her rich uncle, her naive aunt, and their invalid daughter Lucilla (\"Lucy\").  As a man, she attracts the romantic interest of the many women, including Lucy who assumes the disguised Leona plans to propose.  When Christobal comes to London, Leona leaves the household and takes a new disguise as the middle-aged Miss Jane Gibson.  Through her detective work, Leona pieces together the past.  Her father George fell in love with the clerk Richard Levitt\'s daughter Rebecca and they had a child.  Until they could afford to marry, the head clerk Anson adopted the child.  Three years later, during a meeting between Richard Levitt, George Evans, and Anson about the intended marriage, Levitt accidently kills Anson, frames the drunk George Evans, and places him on a boat to America.  Under pain of hanging at home, George goes to Brazil and assumes a new name.  Meantime, Henry Evans, George\'s brother, inherits the business and adopts the child as his own, Lucy Evans.  Armed with the deathbed confession of Richard Levitt procured from the dying Rebecca, Leona clears her father\'s name, inherits his fortune, and marries the patient Christobal.','EC'),

The novel begins with the marriage of elderly Sir Michael Audley of Audley Court and Lucy Graham.  The latter is the young, beautiful, and angelic-mannered governess of the local doctor.  Alicia, Sir Michael\'s adult daughter from his first marriage, resents her new stepmother.  Meantime, George Talboys returns from Australia with a fortune in gold and hopes to reunite with his wife Helen and son who he abandoned three years earlier due to his poverty.  On landing, he meets his old friend Robert Audley, an idle barrister and nephew (and heir) to Sir Michael.  Together, the two learn of the death of George\'s wife the previous week.  The distraught George visits Helen\'s father and hears the story of her death from illness.  At loose ends, George spends the next year traveling with Robert.  On a visit to Audley Court, Robert and George miss meeting Lady Audley who is suddenly called to London to visit a sick former employer.  Crawling through a secret passage, Robert and George view a portrait of Lady Audley.  The next day, during a fishing trip, George mysteriously disappears while Robert is sleeping.  A self-appointed detective, he becomes obsessed with finding his friend.  He suspects Lady Audley has some knowledge of George\'s fate, so Robert begins to trace her past: first the doctor\'s house where she worked as a governess, then to the private school in London where she worked (a hat box with multiple labels is a telling clue).  Meantime, Lady Audley is being blackmailed by her former maid Phoebe Marks and her husband Luke Marks&mdash;she pays them off and they buy a neighboring public house.  Clue by clue, Robert connects Lady Audley with Helen Talboys who has changed her name and bigamously married the baronet.  Confronting Lady Audley, Robert lays out his evidence and threatens to tell Sir Michael, but he gives Lady Audley an opportunity to flee.  She defies him and attempts to kill Robert by setting fire to the Marks\' public house where he is staying.  Instead, Robert escapes and Luke is fatally injured.  Confronted once again, Lady Audley confesses: bitter after George\'s desertion, she changed her name, became a governess, married Sir Michael given the opportunity, and pushed George down a well to keep him silent.  She blames her crimes on hereditary madness: she is the mad daughter of a mad mother.  Robert quietly packs her off to a foreign asylum.  During his investigation, Robert falls in love with George\'s sister Clara and he marries her.  George returns: he survived the fall down the well and fled the country rather than expose Lady Audley to shame.  The novel ends with Robert, Clara, and George all happily living together.','BL; EC; Sutherland'),

She strikes her cousin John after he provokes her and her aunt sends her away to Lowood Institute, a charity school operated by the cruel Mr. Brocklehurst (based on Brontë\'s experiences at Cowen Bridge school).  Before she leaves, Jane confronts her aunt, condemns her treatment at her hands, and denounces her children as liars.  At Lowood, Jane endures physical and spiritual hardships due to the poor conditions at the school.  After a typhus outbreak at the school exposes these conditions, Brocklehurst is replace and conditions improve.  Meantime, Jane learns to temper her behavior through the example of the saintly classmate Helen Burns and the kind teacher Miss Temple.  When her schooling comes to an end, she takes a job as governess at Thornfield Hall to a young French girl Adele Varens.  She soon meets Adele\'s guardian and master of the house Edward Rochester and the two spend many hours together in frank conversations.  The house exhibits strange sounds, such as a coarse laugh, and events, such as a fire in Rochester\'s room and an attack on a guest.  Over time, Jane admits to herself her love for Rochester, however he seems more interested in the rich and beautiful Blanche Ingram.  Nevertheless, Rochester proposes to Jane.  On the eve of the wedding Jane dreams a strange woman sneaks into her room and rips her wedding veil.  When she wakes, she finds the veil has been ripped&mdash;an act (along with the laughter) Rochester attributes to a drunken servant Grace Poole.  At the wedding, Mr. Mason interrupts the ceremony to reveal that Rochester has a wife still living.  Back at Thornfield, Rochester confesses and introduces his mad wife Bertha Mason.  After their marriage in Jamaica, Bertha became mad and Rochester brought her to England to be nursed in the attic by Grace Poole.  Rochester wishes Jane to remain as his mistress, but she refuses and runs away.  Wandering across the moor, she finds refuge with the Rivers siblings: the Rev. St. John Rivers and his sisters Diana and Mary.  In time, St. John reveals they are cousins, children of her father\'s sister, and she has inherited a fortune from her uncle John Eyre.  Happy now to have a family, Jane divides the money between the four cousins.  St. John plans to go to India as a missionary and proposes to Jane.  She refuses and hears the voice of Rochester calling to her across the moor.  Jane returns to Thornfield and finds it burned down.  She learns that Bertha started the fire and committed suicide and that Rochester was injured in his attempt to save her.  Rochester and Jane reunite and marry.','EC; Sutherland; Wolff'),

A mysterious woman arrives at the workhouse in the middle of the night where she gives birth to a boy and dies.  The orphan is raised at a baby farm until the age of ten then sent back to the workhouse.  Despite his vicious upbringing, Oliver remains preternaturally good.  In what has become an iconic scene, he raises the ire of the authorities by innocently asking for more gruel&mdash;in response, he is apprenticed to an undertaker.  After his mistreatment there, Oliver runs away to London where he meets the pickpocket Artful Dodger, his fence Fagin, and the good-hearted prostitute Nancy.  They train Oliver in their ways until he witnesses the Artful Dodger attempt a theft in the street&mdash;horrified, Oliver runs away but is caught by the authorities.  The victim, Mr. Brownlow, intercedes with the judge and takes Oliver home.  While running an errand for Brownlow, Oliver is kidnapped by Fagin\'s gang.  Under the direction of the odious Monks (who wants Oliver hung or transported), Fagin gives Oliver to the housebreaker Bill Sykes.  While burgling a house in the country, Oliver is shot and nursed back to health by Rose Maylie and her aunt.  Meantime, the repentant Nancy meets with Rose and Brownlow to warn them about Monk\'s and Fagin\'s conspiracy against Oliver.  Bill learns of Nancy\'s deceit and murders her.  During his flight from justice, he is accidently hung.  The Artful Dodger is arrested and transported, and Fagin is tried and sentenced to death.  Brownlow forces Monks to confess: he is the half-brother of Oliver, both sons of the same father.  Oliver\'s mother, pregnant but not married, fled London in shame.  Monks hoped to get rid of Oliver in order to keep their inheritance for himself.  Oliver ends the novel safely returned to his family and middle-class comfort.  Monks leaves England for the colonies.','EC; Sutherland; Vann; Wolff'),

Born with a curvature of the spine, Olive is rejected by her ashamed mother and raised by her sympathetic nurse Elspie.  The child is born during the father\'s absence and his first knowledge of Olive\'s condition is revealed on his return&mdash;he is bothered more by his wife\'s lie (of omission) about Olive deformity than the deformity itself.  Despite the estrangement between her parents, Olive\'s humility and gentleness hold the family together.  At her father\'s death, Olive becomes the caretaker of her mother.  They move close to London where they live next door to a struggling painter Vanbrugh and his sister.  Under his tutelage, she becomes a painter which helps to support her mother and pay her father\'s debt to Rev. Harold Gwynne.  After her mother\'s death, Olive moves once again, this time to the neighborhood of Harold, now a widower.  She nurses a love for him that he is unable to return due to his crisis of faith.  Olive\'s sympathy and Christian example eventually win over Harold and an inheritance from an aunt secures their future.  A subplot in the novel centers on Christal, the illegitimate Creole daughter of Angus: when her parentage is revealed, she attempts to kill Olive in revenge for her wronged mother.  The two are reconciled and Christal joins a convent.','BL; EC'),

Dora is the middle daughter of a poor Surrey clergyman.  Now aged twenty-five, she believes she will never marry.  Her eldest sister, Penelope, has been engaged ten years to Francis Charteris, a government functionary and nephew of Sir William Treherne, who awaits either salary or inheritance to maintain a wife.  Dora\'s younger sister, Lisabel, gains the attention of Captain Augustus Treherne, an army officer, veteran of the Crimea, and only son of Sir William.  Through Capt. Treherne, Dora meets his Scottish friend Urquhart, a medical doctor and also a veteran of the Crimea.  The latter acts to facilitate the marriage between Treherne and Lisabel, which occurs at the end of volume one.  A road accident by Dora\'s father, who is attended by Urquhart, cements the relationship between Dora and the doctor.  Without many words, the two consider themselves married in spirit, if not legally.  Before he can ask her, however, he confesses a secret from his past: at the age of nineteen, he became drunk in the company of a older man who encouraged the younger man\'s debauchery.  The two came to blows and when Urquhart awoke from his drunken slumber he found the older man dead.  (In the first edition, the murder is fully accidental; in a later edition, the murder is presented as manslaughter.)  The crime goes unsolved and Urquhart lives a selfless and blameless life from that moment in reparation.  Only in the present does he realize the man he killed was Dora\'s brother.  The crime does not affect Dora\'s love and she forgives him.  Her father, after hearing his confession, also forgives the doctor after much anguished soul-searching but banishes the doctor from his home.  Urquhart sells his commission and goes to work as a surgeon at a Liverpool gaol.  Meantime, Charteris is offered a governor\'s position in the West Indies.  Before they marry, Penelope discovers he has a mistress and child and she refuses his offer.  Stricken with guilt, Urquhart confesses his murder to the authorities.  After a brief trial, he is sentenced to three months in prison.  Dora and Urquhart marry and emigrate to Canada.  The novel has a strong temperance theme and deliberation on Christian forgiveness.','BL; EC'),

Gerald Bernard is an officer in the Coast Guard and he observes the capsizing of a sailboat.  The man in the boat swims to shore leaving a woman to drown but Bernard swims out to save her.  On the walk to their home, she nearly dies again from a fall, possibly due to her father\'s negligence.  Bernard falls in love with the woman, Olive, in spite of her strange and heartless father Redfern.  They marry.  The novel next moves to London and the Brigham family: Josiah Brigham\'s business has gone bankrupt leaving his two sons and three daughters without fortunes.  Susan, the eldest daughter, goes to live as the companion to her wealthy spinster godmother Christina Mayford Llewellen.  They are joined by Miss Llewellen\'s niece Margaret Mayford.  The household in the country is near Gerald\'s brother\'s vicarage&mdash;the Rev. Clayton Bernard is a widower with a young daughter.  Later, the group moves to the Isle of Wight and then London where they circulate with a number of other characters.  The plot divides into a number of intersecting subplots.  Susan\'s cousin Florence Harley runs with a \"fast\" crowd, gambles, and gets in debt.  She later falls in love with Clayton and they plan to marry.  Lord George Annesley, the debt-ridden second son of an earl, is a fortune-hunting hedonist who first pursues Susan (until her father\'s bankruptcy), then Florence, and finally Margaret (who is the beneficiary of Miss Llewellen\'s fortune).  Miss Llewellen\'s butler is embezzling from his overly-trusting employer.  The villain Raynham Fletcher, the middle-aged worldly friend of Lord George, lends money to the young man, blackmails Florence over an indiscretion abroad, and successfully (and secretly) woos Miss Llewellen in order to secure her fortune and revenge himself on Lord George.  Gerald discovers his wife Olive is party to a murder in her past, the couple separates, and Gerald has a breakdown.  The novel ends with Fletcher marrying Miss Llewellen, Lord George breaking off his engagement with the now fortune-less Margaret, the marriage of Florence and Clayton, and the death of Fletcher from poisoning.  Though Florence is the prime suspect in Fletcher\'s murder, she accompanies her husband to Malta.  Reviewers complained about the sudden and seemingly immoral ending.','EC'),

Helen, the daughter of a country doctor, fell in love with Philip (then an army officer) years earlier.  Because of her ethical scruples about the institution of marriage, she declines to marry Philip but agrees to live with him as a mistress.  They live in India for a number of years where Helen passes as \"Mrs. Vaughan\" and the other Englishwomen ostracize her.  On the couple\'s return to England, Philip, the heir to a baronetcy, reconsiders his relationship and decides to marry Gertrude Maitland.  Helen spurns any financial help and goes off to work&mdash;first as a teacher then a lady\'s companion&mdash;losing her position each time her past as a fallen woman comes to light.  After the birth of two children, the marriage between Sir Philip and Gertrude fails because he comes to suspect she may not be faithful due to mysterious letters and assignations with a stranger.  Confronted, Gertrude refuses to explain her behavior and Sir Philip throws her out of his home and she goes to live quietly in France.  Helen accidently meets the miserable man in London and she goes to live with him again.  After his death, Helen as a newly rich woman works out the mystery of Gertrude\'s past.  As a young girl, Gertrude entered into a precipitous marriage with Henry Considine, the English-Cuban-Spanish Catholic son of a miserly father.  The marriage was kept strictly secret so as to not offend Considine\'s father.  Henry abandons Gertrude and she has a mentally handicapped son who is adopted by the sinister Peters who reports to her that Henry has died in Cuba.  (It is he who Sir Philip sees meeting his wife and who sends her letters.)  However, there is no record of Henry Considine\'s death so the marriage between Gertrude and Sir Philip may have been bigamous.  A cousin of Sir Philip instigates a charge of bigamy against her: at the trial it is revealed that Henry Considine died in Spain a few days before Gertrude\'s marriage to Sir Philip.  Helen passes her fortune on to Gertrude and she lives her life performing philanthropic works.  The title of the novel refers to the narrator\'s moral judgement of Helen\'s life, where her numerous good works outweigh her fallen character.','EC'),

George, a poor clergyman, had married Rose Fordyce, the daughter of a wealthy Scotch baronet, against her family\'s wishes.  Lacking a position, Chichester has moved his family to France to work as the town\'s chaplain.  Though poor, the family is happy until George contracts consumption and wastes away.  The now widow contacts her estranged brother, Sir William Fordyce, to ask his assistance in her time of need.  Sir William in the meantime has married a wealthy widow with a mean-spirited daughter (Mrs. Matilda Phillips) and settled on the family estate of Burwood.  The brother and sister-in-law come to Calais: he grants his sister a stipend, helps move the family to England, and assists the sons in their schooling.  Lady Fordyce, however, takes an interest in impish Hilda and asks to keep the girl with her at Burwood.  Rose agrees, thinking it best for Hilda\'s prospects, but Matilda resents the adoption.  Years pass.  Hilda grows up honest yet willful, loved and indulged by her aunt and uncle.  A beautiful young woman, she attracts the attention of Walter Wentworth, a penniless barrister at a family party.  Meantime, distant relations of Sir William&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Graham and their son David&mdash;arrive at Burwood for a visit before the London season.  Mrs. Graham has designs on wedding her son to Hilda, a match she finds socially and economically beneficial.  For his part, David is reluctant to marry, but his mother browbeats him into considering it.  Mrs. Graham convinces Lady Fordyce who agrees to the merits of the match but she stipulates that the engagement not be announced until after the London season and Hilda\'s debut.  Hilda, in deference to her aunt, agrees to the plan.  During the time in London, Hilda and Walter fall in love&mdash;though, as he acknowledges, his ardour is much less than hers and his position does not lend itself to marriage.  Also, whatever regard David and Hilda had for each other melts into cold disregard: Hilda because of her love for Walter and David because of his selfishness.  Hilda, for her part, attempts numerous times to tell her aunt of her changed feelings but never does.  Events come to a climax when Walter professes his love for Hilda at a ball.  A few days later, Lady Fordyce suffers a fatal crash.  On her deathbed, she insists Hilda marry David for her own future security.  Hilda initially refuses, works to call off the marriage, and suffers greatly, but her guilt over her dying aunt\'s request and Walter\'s abandonment leads her to accept the marriage.  Brokenhearted, three months after the marriage Hilda herself dies.','EC'),

His dissipated life has led to the ruin of both his health and his fortune.  Shortly before his death, he sells one of his estates, East Lynne, to the wealthy country lawyer Archibald Carlyle and hides the proceeds from his creditors.  Lord Mount Severn\'s death leaves his only daughter, Lady Isabel Vane, penniless and reliant on his nephew (the new earl) for support.  (The arrival of the creditors to the dead man\'s house, including two who \"arrest the body,\" is affecting.)  Carlyle assists the new earl in handling the creditors and Carlyle falls in love with the pathetic Isabel.  Meantime, back in West Lynne, Barbara Hare meets with her fugitive brother Richard, who has fled the town to avoid conviction on the murder of Hallijohn years earlier.  Barbara convinces Carlyle, who she loves unrequitedly, to attempt to clear her brother\'s name.  On a visit to Lord Mount Severn\'s house, Carlyle meets a downtrodden Isabel, made miserable by Lady Mount Severn who treat the poor orphan contemptuously.  In a moment, Carlyle proposes to Isabel and brings her back to her home East Lynne.  Carlyle\'s domineering older spinster step-sister Cordelia (\"Miss Corny\") comes to live at the estate where she usurps domestic control of the household from the ineffectual Isabel.  Years pass.  Now the mother of three children, Isabel suffers from ennui.  After the last birth, she is sent to France alone to recuperate her health.  There, she meets a former lover and distant cousin, Francis Levison, an profligate dandy who lives in hope of his rich uncle\'s fortune.  Carlyle agrees to help repair Levison\'s credit and invites him back to East Lynne.  There, Levison seduces Isabel by convincing her that Carlyle has fallen in love with Barbara&mdash;Carlyle has been secretly meeting with Barbara to report on his progress with her brother\'s case and Isabel misinterprets the meetings as romantic interludes.  Due to the supposed alienation of her husband\'s affections and the poor treatment by Cordelia, Isabel runs off with Levison.  Carlyle divorces his wife, Levison inherits his uncle\'s estate, and Isabel gives birth to an illegitimate child after Levison refuses to marry her.  Abandoned, Isabel suffers injuries and loses her child in a railway accident.  Reported dead, Isabel uses the opportunity to change her identity and become a governess.  Thinking his divorced wife is dead, Carlyle marries Barbara.  The solution to the murder of Hallijohn converges on the identity of a Captain Thorn, a mysterious dandy who frequently visited Hallijohn\'s daughter Afy.  Isabel, now calling herself Madame Vine, returns to East Lynne as the governess to her own children depending on tinted glasses and the changes to her appearance from her accident to hide her identity.  Her humiliations and humbling experiences in her own household serve as her penance.  Despite her eerie likeness to Carlyle\'s first wife, no one sees through Isabel\'s disguise.  Meanwhile, the town of West Lynne asks Carlyle to stand for parliament and the opposition convinces Levison to oppose him.  He loses the election handily, but several townspeople identify Levison as Captain Thorn and he is arrested.  After a trial, Levison is found guilty of the murder of Hallijohn and sentenced to death (later commuted to life in prison).  Isabel\'s suffering reaches its acme when she attends her son\'s deathbed as his governess.  On her own deathbed, she reveals her identity to Carlyle and she dies a chastened woman.','EC; Sutherland'),

He ends his struggle between his duty to the Spade Club and his passion for Celia by marrying her, quitting his club, and becoming a journalist.  The marriage fails when Mark realizes his genuine affection for her is not returned.  His disillusion is confirmed by Celia\'s callous treatment of their child and himself.  She eventually elopes with a previous suitor Alec Watson.  In the meantime, Linda confesses her great love for Mark.  Celia returns to Mark after the selfish Alec abandons her and she soon dies.

Later that day, Jack\'s father Sir John Balstoun, ignorant of his son\'s proposal, also proposes to Mrs. Desant.  Convinced that Sir John refers to his son\'s marriage offer and not one of his own, Mrs. Desant inadvertently appears to accept the father\'s proposal.  An awkward scene follows in which Mrs. Desant reaffirms her prior acceptance of Jack.  The embarrassed Sir John, out of pique, refuses to condone his son\'s marriage.  The household also contains Miss Mirabel, a one-time singer and the former governess to Sir John\'s daughter Agatha.  While the impasse between father and son remains unresolved, Miss Mirabel, who herself has designs on her employer, identifies Mrs. Desant\'s deceased husband with a man she knew recently in Australia.  Mrs. Desant leaves to find her husband in Australia.  Jack, as a grand gesture, moves to a remote Scottish island to live out his days as a recluse.  After months on his island, Jack\'s aunt cajoles him into returning to society.  In London, Jack becomes the target of the \"fast\" Edith Palliser, a society lady who gambles, smokes, and associates with a like-minded set.  Taken with her charms and ignoring the admonishments of his aunt, he proposes to her.  Meanwhile, Sir John left alone with Miss Mirabel proposes to the former governess.  Unable to find her husband in Australia, Mrs. Desant returns to England.  The discovery of the dying Herbert Dasent reveals all: he and Miss Mirabel had married and separated years ago, and he deserted Mrs. Dasant due to a threatening note sent to him by his first wife.  The marriage of Jack and Constance follows, but only after Miss Palliser elopes with another man more congenial to her personality.  A subplot involves Agatha\'s choice between the boring but rich Lord Morecombe and her lively but poor cousin Freddy.  After refusing the former, she marries the latter.','EC'),

Renie\'s mother died after giving birth; Renie\'s father Colonel Denis Rudkin leaves home in despair to serve as a colonial governor leaving his daughters to the care of a governess and his brother.  He returns home after nine years and shortly thereafter dies leaving his daughters almost nothing.  Renie\'s eldest sister Adeline marries a neighbor and Renie is sent to boarding school where she cultivates her talents in art.  To everyone\'s surprise, the elderly Sir Bevin marries the twenty-year-old Esther, the penniless daughter of a Methodist minister, after meeting her in Brighton.  Out of guilt at his neglect of his brother\'s children, Sir Bevin offers a home to the seventeen-year-old Renie.  At Zeigleheath, Renie paints in secret, sending her canvases to an acquaintance who sells them for her anonymously.  (One of her paintings, unknown to her, makes its way to the Royal Academy.)  Renie cultivates a polite distance between Lady Rudkin and her maid Shepperton but becomes a great favorite of her infant cousin, Rodney, the new heir to Zeigleheath.  The arrival of her school friend Lucy Northwood and the Spanish painter Rufus Sebastian ends Renie\'s loneliness: Rufus discovers Renie\'s ability to paint and the two work together painting portraits of the family.  Rufus tells his story to Renie and Lucy: his mother left him at a young age at a Spanish monastery where he remained until age thirteen.  Unceremoniously exited from the monastery, Rufus made his way in the world as an wandering painter eventually making his way to England.  Lucy, meantime, falls in love with neighboring German count.  A visit from Leopold Gunstan stirs the plot: a distant relation of Sir Bevin, he stood to inherit the estate before the birth of Rodney.  Without a profession or much money, the oily Gunstan has spent his life traveling.  Lucy, playing detective, immediately suspects a prior connection between Gunstan and Lady Rudkin.  One night, Sir Bevin dies suddenly at his desk.  His will names Renie as the sole guardian of his son (which he had arranged shortly before his death) and gives Lady Rudkin only the baronet\'s insurance.  Renie, in her first duty, immediately orders Gunstan away.  Within a year, Lady Rudkin has left after an argument between Renie and Shepperton.  Shortly afterwards, Rodney dies after falling in the river and drowning.  Gunstan, now Sir Leopold, inherits the estate and only after months of searching can he be found.  He arrives to take over the estate with his new wife, Esther, formerly Lady Rudkin, now Lady Gunstan.  Renie moves to a house nearby.  Some Spanish gypsies take up residence on the estate and Renie is called to deathbed of their \"queen\" who turns out to be the missing sister of Sir Bevin.  Presumed dead, she as a young woman instead ran off with the gypsies.  Renie concludes (rightly) that the woman is the mother of Rufus&mdash;hence, he would be the true owner of Zeigleheath.  Renie vows not to tell Rufus of his parentage before her aunt dies.  Ultimately, through the testimony of a servant and a gypsy girl, it is revealed that Sir Bevin committed suicide after seeing his wife kiss Gunstan.  Gunstan hid the death in order to secure Lady Rudkin\'s insurance benefit.  Confronted by the witnesses, Gunstan confesses to the cover-up and to his murder of Rodney before killing himself.  The novel ends with Rufus\'s return&mdash;ill, he dies shortly after.  The estate reverts to the crown.  The novel clearly draws on Braddon\'s <i>Lady Audley\'s Secret</i>.','BL; Sadleir'),

George falls in love with the mysterious Amy, who is reticent about her past but who\'s clothes and manners bespeak good breeding.  Amy, for her part, resists George\'s love making but she falls in love with him as well.  Sir Hugh recognizes Amy from his time in India&mdash;she is the run-away wife of Captain Hugh Clayton.  In meeting with her, he agrees to keep her secret and tells her that her husband is frantically searching for her.  George misinterprets their meetings and letters as a prior love relationship.  Distraught and unwilling to confess to George, Amy leaves the vicarage for another situation with the nouveau riche Mounsey family.  When she realizes that her husband is the cousin of Mrs. Mounsey, Amy confesses her past to George: she married Clayton, accompanied him to India, and discovered he had a prior Irish wife.  Though Clayton insisted it was no legal marriage (implying he tricked the unfortunate woman), Amy felt otherwise and ran away from Clayton.  George places Amy again with his father\'s family and leaves to take a business position in St. Petersburg, Russia.  Meantime, Sir Hugh falls in love with a local fisherwoman, the beautiful Peggy Richardson.  He secretly marries her in Scotland and leaves her with child when he drowns after a boating accident.  This throws the inheritance of the baronetcy in some confusion until Peggy and her child die during childbirth, leaving the title to Arthur Manners.  Clayton, suffering from alcoholism and mania, finally tracks Amy down to the vicarage.  He confronts Amy and, when she refuses to return to him, he shoots her twice then himself.  Amy survives her gunshots; Clayton dies from his.  When she recovers, Amy and George marry.','BL'),

Meantime, her father\'s fortunes continue suffering and he encourages Nell to marry Sir Hugh Lancaster, a wealthy baronet.  But Nell continues to meet Dick secretly while Dolly works to keep them apart.  During a visit to Sir Hugh\'s home, he and Nell suffer a dog-cart accident and the two spend a night in an inn while she recovers.  Nell, however, remains unmoved by the baronet and commits herself to Dick.  Thereafter, Dick joins his regiment in Cork.  Strangely, none of his promised letters arrive from him.  Six months later, Nell\'s father\'s health fails and bankruptcy looms.  Sir Hugh proposes and under great pressure to save her father further pains Nell accepts.  Shortly after the marriage, her father dies.  When Dick\'s regiment is ordered to India, he stops in England to see Nell and he accuses her of jilting him by letter.  However, Dolly wrote the letter.  In her despair, Nell offers to go to India with Dick, but he wisely reasons her out of such a calamitous step.

Thomas dies shortly after, leaving a pregnant widow to raise the twins Edward (Ned) and Nathaniel (Nat).  Ned, destined to inherit the estate, grows up pampered and indulged, attends a lax tutor for his education, and enrolls in Oxford after cramming with the dubious Tom Snipe.  Meantime, Nat attends Eton, receives a comprehensive education, becomes a gentleman, and goes into law to make his own way in the world.  At Oxford, Ned runs with a fast set: enabled by his wealth and mentored by Snipe, he gambles, sports, drinks, and neglects his studies.  This life culminates with Ned proposing to elope with a bar maid Alice&mdash;caught, Ned is rusticated and breaks off contact with Alice.  A subplot focuses on the jilted Alice and her return to her sister Hannah, who works as a lady\'s companion for Mrs. Belmont.  Freed of Alice, who he cold-heartedly pays fifty pounds, Ned throws himself in to a dissolute life resulting in an illegitimate child who lives in poverty.  Snipe returns to help Ned pursue a rich heiress Miss Lindsay&mdash;her inheritance requires her husband to settle £10,000 on her, which Ned gladly does.  After the marriage, Miss Lindsay reveals her true identity as Hannah, the now avenged sister of Alice.  The marriage is passed off as a fraud and Ned returns to the country where he marries Lucy, the daughter of a neighbor.  Years pass in rustic tranquillity, until Ned is called upon to sentence a murderer who turns out to be his own illegitimate child grown up a thief, and Hannah returns one last time to reveal Ned\'s crimes.  A chastened Ned lives out the rest of his life reflecting on his folly.  The twists of the plot give the author much space to moralize on the ramifications of a sinful life.','EC'),

She receives a letter from a maternal aunt, the rich widow Mrs. Sutherland, offering her a position in her house as governess to her youngest daughter, Eunice.  She moves south to \"Ringly Royal\" in Surrey where she is introduced to the Sutherland family: the imperious mother, the proud eldest daughters Charlotte and Isabel, their better-natured brother Yorke, and the youngest Eunice.  (Three other brothers live away from home: the married Albert, the banker William, and the colonial Jack.)  Penny by degrees adds the housekeeper duties to her role as governess.  Soon another niece arrives at the house: Joan \"Jocky\" Berden is the daughter of an \"unfortunate match\" between Mrs. Sutherland\'s sister and a Yorkshire mill owner.  Jocky, in the words of the narrator, \"was peculiar.  Braver than most women, and fascinating to a dangerous degree, she exercised a charm over people that eclipsed the beauty of others completely.\"  Jocky bewitches (in turn) a visitor Mr. Travers Thorne (who proposes and is turned down), Yorke (who also proposes and is accepted), and a rake Colonel Clavel.  Dancing with the latter leads to a disagreement between Yorke and Jocky.  As a result Jocky decides to leave and Penny accompanies Jocky to her mother\'s rural house near Ripon in Yorkshire.  While there, Travers visits and Jocky (scandalously) entertains him in the kitchen while she cooks.  And, they are bothered by a persistent beggar who is run off by the dog.  After the death of Mrs. Berden, the two women return to Ringly Royal where soon after Jocky is assaulted in her bedroom.  She refuses all questions of who attacked her, but Yorke suspects Thorne who is found strangled a few days later.  After Jocky confirms Thorne\'s innocence, she disappears.  Penny suspects Yorke killed Thorne.  Years pass.  Jack, Yorke\'s brother, returns from India, falls in love with Penny, and marries her (all within a few pages!).  While at the theatre with her husband, Penny recognizes the actress \"Miss Thorne\" as Jocky.  Penny accompanies Jocky back to Yorkshire where she confesses: she was attacked by the beggar, in reality her fugitive criminal brother.  Now dead, for years, he has been extorting money from the family and he murdered Thorne.  In the end, Jocky marries Yorke.</p>\n\n<p class=\"entry\">The novel also contains the short story \"Harvest Queen.\"  The story concerns the fate of the four Boucher children: Henry (\"Ned\"), Isabel (\"Bell\"), Georgiana (\"Georgie\", who suffers from a disabled leg), and Memie.  They were born and raised by their parents in Demerara (present-day Guyana) before being sent with their black nurse to live with their widowed uncle in London.  He sends them to school in Harrow.  The youngest, Memie, dies to be followed by their parents in South America.  Left a pittance, Ned goes to Canada where he dies.  Bell and Georgie go to live with the family friend Mr. Pole, an Irishman who owns a farm at Lea Hurst, Sussex.  While there, Bell gains the attention of both Pole\'s godson, the aptly named Cecil Frankly, and his drunken son, Dunstan Pole.  Cecil dies in a fall from this window either as a result of his sleepwalking or the jealous Dunstan.  Bell and Georgie leave the farm for London where Bell becomes a renowned actress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"entry\">The novel also contains the short story \"Fairy.\"  The story centers on Frances, the youngest daughter of the Rector of Boscobel in Sussex.  A tomboy, she is dubbed \"Fairy\" by her cousin Alexander Stewart.  He is dispatched with his army unit to Bombay.  A few years later he returns still smitten by his cousin.  They wed.','BL; EC'),

Neider comes to Matthew Genny\'s Follingay farm to learn the science of farming where he joins two other students, Nicholas Thirsk and William Grey.  Whereas Neider and Grey earnestly take to farming, Thirsk acts indifferently towards Genny\'s instruction.  Neider soon learns that Thirsk has come to the farm in order to plan an elopement with Agatha Freemantle, an heiress of £60,000 and sister of a neighboring landowner Sir Richard Freemantle.  Earlier, Thirsk has developed an unexplained hatred for the baronet and sees his sister as the solution to his money problems.  Meantime, Neider has fallen in love with Genny\'s niece Harriet who acts as his housekeeper and Grey is smitten by another niece Mercy Ricksworth who is the daughter of a drunken and dissolute father Peter.  Mercy has turned down Grey\'s proposal to save him from the embarrassment of her father.  With the help of Mercy, Thirsk elopes with Agatha at the Tramlingford Races and the two live in London to await Agatha\'s coming of age.  Harriet, anticipating Neider\'s imminent proposal, confesses she has promised herself to another man, her cousin Robert Genny years earlier.  Robert, a hack journalist and novelist, stays at his uncle\'s farm and holds Harriet to her youthful promise.  Both feel that marriage will steady his character and keep him from drinking and gambling.  At the end of their tutelage and still bachelors, Neider and Grey go in on a farm together outside London.  All of Thirsk\'s hopes come to nothing when the bank holding his wife\'s money smashes on her twenty-first birthday.  Left with just enough to pay his debts, a bitter Thirsk blames Sir Richard for his troubles and turns to journalism to support his wife and son.  (The bank failure also causes Genny to lose his farm and he comes to work for Neider and Grey.)  Peter Ricksworth, spurred on by the promise of £1000, attempts to kill Sir Richard&mdash;instead, he kills his daughter and severely injures Thirsk\'s son.  A chastened Thirsk reconciles with Sir Richard and turns over a new leaf.  Robert Genny, his talent wasted, drinks himself to death.  Two years later, Neider and Harriet marry.  The title refers to the three women characters&mdash;Agatha, Harriet, and Mercy&mdash;who patiently endure much suffering from the men in their lives.','BL; EC'),

Both hold high church views which put them at odds with the low church views of their congregation who like a \"plain, simple service.\"  The decoration of the church during Easter shocks the town and leads to protests and near riots.  The newly married Martin Chester and Ada Hartley return from their honeymoon amidst the turmoil.  Ada falls under the spell of Geoffrey\'s sermons whereas Martin expresses discomfort with the needlessly antagonist actions of the Stones.  His attempts to reason with Geoffrey on behalf of the town fail.  Concerned about the possible violence, Martin forbids Ada from attending a service, but she defies him.  This leads to a falling out between the couple.  Geoffrey, in an attempt to reconcile the two, leads Ada into a confession in the vestry.  Caught, Martin demands Ada give up going to the local church: when she refuses, they separate.  Meantime, Martin\'s brother Frank proposes to his long-time love Margaret Cheyne but she refuses him and accepts Geoffrey\'s offer (as she has also fallen under his religious spell).  She soon regrets her choice, so Ada attempts to gently break the match with Geoffrey while Margaret attempts to reconcile Martin and Ada.  Martin, convinced by Margaret of Ada\'s remorse, sees Ada tête-á-tête with Geoffrey and misconstrues the subject.  He confronts Geoffrey and the latter explains the truth and apologizes.  Martin accepts it and they part.  That night, Geoffrey is shot dead.  Martin is arrested (witnesses saw him follow the dead man) and tried for murder.  The shock ruins Ada\'s health.  The trial reveals the mystery: the drunkard Sam Burles harbors a grudge against Geoffrey for evicting him from his house so he burns down the church and shoots the curate.    Martin and Ada tearfully reconcile shortly before she dies.  The novel ends with Frank marrying Margaret.','BL; EC'),

She rejects the advances of the former before realizing the hollow flatteries of the latter.  Esther returns in order to warn Mary away from a similar fate.  Jem confronts Harry, which comes to hard words and blows.  John\'s union activities lead him to become a Chartist and he delivers their petition to London, to no avail.  In revenge, the union decides to assassinate Harry Carson.  After Harry is shot, Jem is arrested for the murder due to their earlier confrontation.  With the help of Esther, Mary realizes her father is guilty of the murder and she goes to heroic efforts to locate an alibi witness for Jem.  At the trial, Jem is acquitted and Mary collapses from nerves and exhaustion.

Margaret Hale is the daughter of a country clergyman and she lives with her aunt and cousin Edith in London.  The marriage of Edith to Captain Lennox prompts her return to her parents in the rural village Helstone.  There, Captain Lennox\'s brother Henry Lennox, a rising barrister, visits Margaret and proposes to her.  She refuses him.  Soon after, her father confesses his crisis of faith to her: asked by his bishop to reaffirm his belief in the thirty-nine articles, Mr. Hale finds he cannot in good conscious do so.  As a result, he must give up his living.  The family&mdash;Margaret, her father, her invalid mother, and loyal servant Dixon&mdash;pack up and move north to the factory city of Milton (read, Manchester) where Mr. Hale\'s old friend Mr. Bell owns property.  There they meet Bell\'s tenant, the cotton-factory owner John Thornton, who wishes to be tutored by Mr. Hale.  Thornton, one of the leading men of the town, rose by his own initiative to a position of wealth and prominence influenced greatly by his mother\'s principles of hard work and thrift.  Initially, Margaret and Thornton each look askance at the other: Margaret views the manufacturer as a \"tradesman\" so not a gentleman; and Thornton views the poor clergyman\'s daughter as unjustifiably proud and arrogant.  During her time in Milton, Margaret also meets the factory workers Nicholas Higgins and his consumptive daughter Betsy who she visits.  Between Thornton and Higgins, Margaret learns about the tensions in the town between the masters and the men and the looming strike by the latter.  When the strike does occur, everyone suffers.  The strike ends in a riot: prompted by Thornton\'s decision to import workers from Ireland, the striking workers confront him at his factory where Margaret blocks a rock meant for Thornton.  She is not seriously wounded, but Thornton, who realizes he loves Margaret, interprets the act as one of love on her side: he proposes but she refuses him.  Meantime, Mrs. Hale falls seriously ill and on her death bed requests to see her son Frederick one last time.  Her son during his time in the Royal Navy participated in a mutiny against a cruel and tyrannical captain.  Under pain of death in England, he lives in Spain.  Frederick risks capture and is present at his mother\'s death.  While sneaking him out of town, Margaret is seen with him by Thornton (who assumes the man is her lover) and she is later forced to lie about being at the train station.  The lie protects her brother but affects her character in Thornton\'s eyes.  Higgins, as a leader of the strike, fails to find work until Margaret intercedes with Thornton on his behalf.  Due to the influence of Margaret, both men become more sympathetic with the position of the other&mdash;Thornton in particular attempts some new \"experiments\" in management.  When Margaret\'s father dies, she moves back to London with her aunt and learns that the childless Bell has made her the heir to his considerable fortune after his death.  Unfortunately, Thornton\'s business fails due to the lingering effects of the strike.  Come to London to tend to business matters with his new landlord Margaret, they profess their love to one another.  Presumably her wealth will save his factory.','BL; EC; Vann'),

Set in the waning days of the Napoleonic wars, the novel begins with the angelic Amelia Sedley and the social-climbing Becky Sharp leaving Miss Pinkerton\'s finishing school.  Amelia is the daughter of a prosperous London merchant and is engaged to the proud Captain George Osborne, a calvary officer.  Becky is the orphaned daughter of a poor painter and French opera dancer (she works for her education at Pinkerton\'s by teaching French).  While visiting the Sedleys, Becky attempts to trap Amelia\'s wealthy brother Joseph into marriage&mdash;newly returned from India, the shy Joseph is overwhelmed by Becky\'s advances.  The would-be marriage falls to pieces after a disastrous trip to Vauxhall Gardens where George Osborne encourages Joseph to overindulge in punch and to make a fool of himself.  The sober Joseph flees London.  Becky goes as the governess to Queen\'s Crawley, the seat of the odious and ill-mannered baronet Sir Pitt Crawley.  While there, Becky meets Captain Rawdon Crawley (Sir Pitt\'s second son) and Miss Crawley (Sir Pitt\'s rich spinster sister) and quickly becomes a favorite with the cosmopolitan relatives.  When Sir Pitt\'s sickly wife dies, he proposes to Becky&mdash;however, she has already secretly wed Rawdon.  He is quickly disowned by father and aunt.  Meanwhile, Mr. Sedley loses his fortune and Mr. Osborne forbids his son to marry the penniless Amelia.  George\'s best friend, the dependable and self-effacing Dobbin, shames him into keeping his word to his fiance which George soon regrets.  Their marriage leads Mr. Osborne to scratch his son\'s name out of the family bible.  Shortly afterwards, the English army gets called to Belgium: in Brussels, Becky leads a willing George astray at a ball.  During the battle of Waterloo, George dies.  Amelia returns to London with her son and lives with her parents in poverty.  Becky, meanwhile, sparkles in London society, lives on \"nothing a year,\" and neglects her husband and son.  She becomes entangled with the lecherous Lord Steyne who supports Becky for his own ends.  Events come to a head: Rawdon freed from debtors\' prison finds Becky and Lord Steyne alone together and strikes the peer.  The pair separate: Becky goes to the continent and Rawdon goes to Coventry Island as governor where he dies of fever.  The faithful Dobbin proposes to Amelia but the widow still idolizes her dead husband.  Amelia, under great distress, gives her son to Mr. Osborne to raise.  When Mr. Osborne dies, young George inherits a fortune.  Amelia, accompanied by Joseph and Dobbin, visit the continent where they meet Becky who tells Amelia about George\'s behavior on the eve of Waterloo.  Amelia finally accepts the long-suffering Dobbin.  Joseph, again smitten, marries Becky and quickly dies, leaving an inheritance for Becky which enables her to once again enter high society.','BL; EC; Sutherland; Vann'),

A highly sensational novel involving false identities, fraud, and bigamy.  Homeless and unemployed William Hope, with his motherless daughter Grace, tramps across northern England seeking work.  In Hull he enters the offices of Bartley where he meets two clerks: Bolton (really Bartley\'s nephew Walter Clifford in disguise) and Leonard Monckton.  Walter hopes to learn business without his father Colonel Clifford\'s knowledge due to his father\'s prejudice against trade.  Coincidentally, much happens in the short space of a day.  Monckton\'s embezzlement has been detected and he attempts to frame Walter with the crime (which is observed by Hope).  Colonel Clifford arrives to report the death of his sister whose £20,000 fortune has been left to Bartley\'s daughter Mary who has died earlier that very day.  Bartley and Hope meet: the poor man confesses to his poverty and starving daughter, and Bartley proposes he raise Hope\'s child as his own thereby securing the inheritance to his \"daughter\" and not Clifford\'s son Walter.  Hope, in his desperation, agrees to the fraud in exchange for a comfortable position in the company.  This conversation is observed by Monckton who plans to blackmail the two.  In another of his villainous schemes, he aims to entrap Walter into a marriage with his \"sister\" Lucy&mdash;she has cold feet at the last moment and Walter escapes the trap.  However, Monckton (in Walter\'s name) marries Lucy.  When Bartley accuses Walter of theft, Hope (now freshly clothed as a gentleman) reveals Monckton\'s crime and the villain is arrested, tried, and sentenced to fourteen years.  He swears revenge on the three.  Over the intervening years, Bartley raises Grace as his own daughter Mary, Hope works as Bartley\'s business manager, and Walter returns to his father to clear the family\'s estate of its debts.  Bartley rents a farm from Colonel Clifford, despite their mutual antipathy, in order to mine coal on the land through a sharply worded contract.  The move brings Grace and Walter together and the two fall in love against their fathers\' wishes.  Eventually, they secretly marry hoping their fathers will have to accept their marriage.  Monckton\'s release from prison brings him to the neighborhood seeking revenge on Bartley, Hope, and Walter.  In disguise, Monckton shows Grace the fraudulent marriage license causing her to question her marriage to Walter.  A lost bracelet and the revelation of the secret marriage causes Hope to reclaim Grace as his own daughter (hence Bartley\'s fraud on the Cliffords).  Monckton, attempting to blackmail Bartley, pressures the businessman into firing the mine with Hope in it to secure his silence.  Grace overhears their plan and runs to the mine to warn her father&mdash;arriving too late, Hope and Grace are trapped in the mine.  Bartley, to his credit, immediately repents of his actions and works, alongside Walter, to free those trapped in the mine.  Freed at the last minute, Walter and Grace are reunited.  A chastened Clifford wholeheartedly accepts his new daughter-in-law; a forgiven Bartley retires to his farm; and Hope goes on to be a successful engineer.  Monckton, however, escapes the law through the machinations of his lawyer.  He has inherited a large estate from a distant relative, so he changes names and lives with Lucy until his early death.','BL; Sutherland; Vann'),

Of the latter class, the elder son and heir Durill is a successful engineer; another son Julius is a successful solicitor in London; the elder daughter Judith remains a spinster after a heartbreak in her youth; and the youngest May serves as Durill\'s right hand in managing their father\'s estate Wild Wood.  Of the \"Benton-Drevers,\" the second son Gilbert has made an unfortunate marriage to a low woman.  Debt-ridden, without a profession, and cut off by his father, he sends his two children Ivo and Evelyn to live at the estate where they become the favorites of Durill and May.  (In a heart-rending scene later in the novel, Evelyn dies from internal injuries after a fall.)  Minnie has married the local doctor, Mark Calvert, and neglects both her husband and children.  The unmarried Lois is vain and a flirt.  The youngest son Crispin has racked up debts at university.  The plot centers on the mysterious behavior of Judith concerning a heirloom necklace in her possession, the strange letters send to Julius from a Jewish moneylender (who is depicted in a thoroughly anti-semetic way), and the will of their father gone missing after his death.  Crispin has forged his brother Julius\'s name to a loan (hence the letters); to cover his crime, Durill and Julius pay off the loan and ship Crispin off to Australia.  Judith has given the necklace to Gilbert in a misguided attempt to help him financially.  Knowing that he is cut out of his father\'s will, Gilbert steals the papers and after his father\'s death attempts to shoot Durill.  However, in attempting to escape, Gilbert suffers a serious fall and dies.  The novel ends with Durill marrying Mark\'s sister Rose and May marrying their neighbor Captain Hardwick.','BL'),

The novel is really a series of episodes in the lives of the residents of Cranford, a small town in Cheshire.  The narrator, Mary Smith, visits the town and stays with her spinster aunts, the friendly Matilda \"Matty\" Jenkyns and the more rigid Deborah Jenkyns, both daughter of the late rector.  The arrival of Captain Brown, a retired army officer, and his daughters the invalid Miss Brown and Jessie Brown, disrupt the smooth-running society.  He, a champion of Dickens\'s novel <i>Pickwick Papers</i>, annoys Deborah with his taste in literature and rough manners.  Captain Brown dies in a train accident and, after the death of her sister, Jessie marries Major Gordon.  Matty visits an old lover Thomas Holbrook, a successful farmer, who dies after visiting Paris.   The arrival of the traveling magician Signor Brunoni and his wife causes another stir in the town.  Deborah dies, leaving Matty alone in the world.  After the bank fails where Matty\'s small investments reside, she opens a small tea shop.  She is saved from her poverty by the arrival of her wealthy brother Peter from India.','BL; Sutherland'),

Later, the novel reveals she is married to a cruel, domineering, and jealous husband.  Ideala, with few exceptions, endures her husband\'s abuse and writes poetry anonymously.  But when she discovers his adultery with a barmaid and he strikes her, she decides to seek advice.  Through the recommendation of a friend, she meets Lorrimer, a doctor of psychology at the Great Hospital.  Ideala confesses her troubles to Lorrimer, returns regularly to use the hospital\'s library and a friendship eventually springs up between the two.  Initially, Ideala considers divorce from her husband but fears the publicity.  After attending the death of her husband\'s cast-off mistress, she separates from him.  A few months later, Ideala agrees to run away with Lorrimer, to the horror of Lord Dawne.  After many painful interviews, he and his sister successfully convince the couple to call off the proposed affair.  The novel ends with Ideala dedicating herself to helping poor women in London.','BL; EC'),

The murder weapon, a pen knife, is also missing.  A gardener, Franks, is accused of the murder on thin circumstantial evidence and Ferroll, to the amazement of his neighbors, pays for his defense.  After the servant\'s acquittal, Ferroll compounds the scandal by assisting the man and his wife\'s emigration to Canada.  For his part, after the trial, Ferroll leaves his estate for an extended time.  Years later, he returns with his second wife: Elinor Shaleton is the love of his early life, the penniless daughter of an old family.  Settled once again, Ferroll becomes reclusive and turns his attention to his literary employments (mainly political essays).  In regards to his neighbors, he scrupulously avoids accepting any invitations and rarely visits them.  (Though, he does not hold his wife to the same.)  A daughter, Janet, is born to the couple.  Over the years, a number of events occur.  Ferroll save his neighbor, Lucy Bartlett, from a mad butler who attempts to burn down her house.  At grave risk to himsef, he superintends county\'s response to a cholera outbreak (this part of the novel is recounted through a journal).  During the trial of working men accused of burning mills, Ferroll faces down a riot by shooting its leader (ironically, a man he saved during the cholera epidemic).  Ferroll is arrested for murder, refuses bail, and tried for the crime: the jury finds him guilty, but strongly recommend him for mercy and Ferroll is pardoned by the government.  The family then takes a trip to France where Ferroll suffers a serious accident.  After a long recuperation, they return to England to find that Martha Franks, the wife of the man accused of Ferroll\'s first wife\'s murder, has returned as well.  When some jewelry belonging to the dead woman is found in her possession, Martha is tried for the murder.  Before her certain conviction, Ferroll confesses: it was he who murdered his wife.  As proof to his claim, he recovers the murder weapon and missing watch from his wife\'s grave.  The shock kills the second Mrs. Ferroll.  With the assistance of Janet, Ferroll escapes from prison and flees to America.  The second edition of the novel has a \"concluding notice\" showing Ferroll\'s last two years in Boston living a quiet life before dying himself.','BL'),

Herminia Barton is a \"very free and advanced\" young woman, a former student at Girton and daughter of a dean.  She meets the like-minded Alan Merrick, the son of a rich doctor.  They take to meeting frequently and fall in love.  Alan proposes marriage, but Herminia refuses: she argues that marriage is legal slavery and against her notions of freedom.  She offers Alan a free-love union, which he accepts after agonizing over its implications for Herminia\'s social standing.  As a result of their relationship, Herminia becomes pregnant and she again refuses Alan\'s offer of marriage.  The couple travel to Italy where a daughter, Dolores, is born.  Shortly afterwards, Alan catches typhoid and dies without marrying Herminia or writing his will.  Dr. Merrick arrives and refuses to help Herminia since it is \"her own doing.\"  Herminia returns to London and works as a novelist and journalist (she even writes a New Woman novel) to support herself and her daughter.  Years pass.  Herminia becomes friends with Harvey Kynaston, a politician and Fabian Society member.  He proposes to her, but he refuses to accept her conditions of a free-love union (due to his political ambitions).  Dolores grows up with conventional ideas despite Herminia\'s pains as to her education.  While visiting a classmate\'s grand house, Dolores falls in love with Walter Brydges.  Dolores\'s birth becomes an obstacle&mdash;she confronts her mother who confesses her illegitimate birth.  Outraged, Dolores angrily denounces her mother and flees to her grandfather\'s house.  He takes her in with the condition that she have nothing to do with her mother.  In despair, Herminia commits suicide.  Dolores marries Walter.','EC; Wolff'),

Her father, Stephen Warden, offers a reward and hires a detective to trace her.  The local townspeople organize a large-scale search of the area, but no clue to her fate turns up.  The intellectual Lord Hardcastle and the atheletic Frank Varley (the rector\'s rich son), rivals for the hand of Amy, both swear to each other to find the woman, living or dead.  Mr. Hill, the detective, can not follow Amy\'s movements past meeting the postman and some farmers on the morning she disappeared.  To further his investigation, he questions the servants in the house, immediately suspecting Amy\'s maid Lucy Williams of hiding something.  Her brother Tom has been accused of a crime, fled to American, but has since returned.  Hill recommends the maid be watched closely.  After smallpox visits the house, Lucy is found missing.  Lord Hardcastle examines her room for clues and sends Varley after her.  Varley follows her to the house of her London friend named Kempe where he finds Lucy suffering from smallpox and delirious.  He discovers that though she stole some jewelry from Amy, she does not know any thing about her lady\'s disappearance.  Varley then attempts to track down Tom in Liverpool and Dublin.  Meantime, back at the Warden house, in the midst of a terrible thunderstorm, Mrs. Warden dies shortly before the hound finds the body of Amy in the reeds of the neighboring stream.  Inexplicably, she is wearing a wedding band.  A mystery to everyone, Mr. Warden puts the name \"Aimée\" on his daughter\'s headstone.  Varley reacts to the news of Amy\'s death by falling into a fever&mdash;his mother and Mary Burton (a family friend) rush to his aid and nurse him back to health.  When he recovers, Varley marries Mary.  Lord Hardcastle moves in with Mr. Warden to help him through his grief: eventually, the latter confesses his history to Lord Hardcastle.  In his youth, Warden contracted a hasty marriage with a beautiful but imperious French woman named Aimée.  Together they have a daughter named Aimée, later called Amy.  Warden tries to moderate her behavior but she abandons him with her maid Isola leaving the daughter behind.  Warden later hears of his wife\'s death.  He marries his daughter\'s governess and returns to England.  Lord Hardcastle convinces Warden to take a trip to France for his health.  While there, Lord Hardcastle discovers Amy and Isola and he reunites father and daughter.  Amy tells her story: receiving a letter from her mother, she met Isola who spirited her away to France to meet her mother still living in a nunnery.  The sickly woman has a fancy to see her husband once more: disguised in her daughter\'s clothes (whom she closely resembles) she sneaks out of the nunnery and dies in the grounds of Warden\'s house.

Based on his study of the gospels, he develops a doctrine of \"practical Christianity\" based on a strict imitation of Jesus\'s actions and teachings.  In general, he sees most professed Christians falling far short of Jesus\'s example and he is quick to point out these failings.  These beliefs lead him variously into conflict with clergymen of all denominations, politicians, philanthropists, and his fellow workers.  Run out of his home town, Joshua moves to London where he successfully rehabilitates a prostitute Mary and a burglar Joe.  Despite following Jesus\'s example by ministering to the worst of sinners, he is ostracized by \"respectable\" society for associating with criminals.  Joshua\'s membership in trade unions leads him towards more overt political activism.  Eventually, Joshua\'s beliefs lead him to communism when he concludes that Jesus and his apostles lived collectively.  When the commune is proclaimed in Paris, Joshua rushes to join but his Christianity clashes with the professed atheism of the revolutionaries.  He escapes death but Mary dies.  Returning to England, Joshua is harassed and tarred with the crimes of the Paris commune.  While attempting to give a talk to a group of working men, Joshua is killed by a mob inflamed by a clergyman\'s denouncement of his \"practical Christianity.\"  The novel is told from the perspective of Joshua\'s life-long friend John.','BL; EC; Sutherland'),

At twenty three, over her uncle\'s and Mary\'s objections, she marries the kind-hearted but relatively poor Frank Herbert: together his small income of £300 per year in addition to Bertha\'s £400 per year should afford a comfortable life without the luxuries to which Bertha has been accustomed.  In fact, Bertha and Frank romanticize their future of genteel poverty.  After the wedding and honeymoon, they set up a small household in the suburbs where Bertha struggles with household economy and Frank invests in expensive furniture.  They might have struggled on indefinitely if not for the crash of Bertha\'s maternal uncle\'s business (due to bad investments and possibly fraud) and with it the loss of her small fortune.  Left with only £300 per year and a new baby boy, the couple move to the country where Bertha hides her discomfort from her husband whom she still loves.  The local neighbors, the rector Doall and his family, are comically vulgar.  To make some much needed money, Frank undertakes a business trip to China leaving his pregnant wife and son behind.  While Frank is gone, Bertha gives birth to a daughter, Alice.  When Frank returns, the family moves to Germany where Frank has accepted a job managing mines from a German businessman he met on the boat coming home.  The life in Germany runs smoothly: the mine owner, Madame La Princesse de Sauerlich, is friendly; the local doctor Knoblauch befriends them; Mary accompanies them; and Frank is successful in managing the mine.  The former governess Mary marries the doctor.  A few years later a fever strikes the town and Bertha and her son both die.  Frank, now a widower, and his fifteen-year old daughter return to lodgings in London.  After two years, thinking his daughter needs a mother, Frank is drawn into a marriage with the parsimonious Bessie Graves, the status-conscious orphan niece of the wealthy retired businessman Mr. Clott.  Once again, Frank marries on limited means which his second wife resents and he comes to regret.  While taking Alice to London, Frank falls ill and the doctor recommends German baths.  The two get as far as Antwerp before Frank becomes bedridden.  They are joined there by the Knoblauchs and Bessie and meet Mr. Cecil Champney, a seemingly poor gentleman and distant cousin, who assists the family.  Alice becomes an heiress when Mr. Clott dies and leaves the bulk of his £40,000 fortune to Alice; she becomes an orphan when her father dies shortly afterwards.  Champney proposes to Alice but she refuses him due to a misunderstanding of his motives on her part.      Back in London society, Alice eventually becomes reconciled to Champney and they marry.  At the end, he inherits the baronetcy from her uncle.','BL'),

The story is composed, like the sensation novels of Wilkie Collins, of a collection of documents by the various characters.  A young lawyer Jonathan Harker goes to Transylvania to visit a client Count Dracula at his isolated and gothic castle.  Dracula plans to buy an estate and immigrate to England.  Harker witnesses a number of mysterious events while there including the lack of servants, the absence of Dracula\'s reflection, and his confinement to a set of rooms.  In his investigations, he meets three voluptuous women who attempt to seduce him until he is rescued by Dracula, and he later sees Dracula exit the castle by climbing down the walls.  By this point, Harker fears for his life.  He scales down the wall and discovers Dracula\'s crypt.  Harker\'s narrative ends with his decision to escape the castle.  Back in England, the novel introduces Dr. John Seward the head of a lunatic asylum and his strange \"zoophagous\" patient Renfield; Mina Murray the fiance of Jonathan Harker; and Lucy Westenra and her admirers the American Quincey Morris and the Hon. Arthur Holmwood.  Lucy receives three proposals in one day from Seward, Morris, and Holmwood and accepts the latter man for her husband.  Mina and Lucy take a vacation to Whitby.  While there, a sudden and powerful storm beaches a Russian ship: everyone on the ship has disappeared save the captain lashed to the wheel.  The ship\'s log records the doomed ship\'s history, its cargo of fifty boxes of earth, and the mysterious presence of an evil force on the ship.  Shortly after, Lucy takes to sleepwalking: on one occasion, Mina finds Lucy in the graveyard.  Back in London, Lucy wastes away.  Seward calls in his teacher Professor Abraham Van Helsing to consult on the case.  Van Helsing immediately deduces the cause of her illness (which for the time he conceals) and begins a series of blood transfusions (in turn, Seward, Van Helsing, Morris, and Holmwood).  Despite their efforts, Lucy dies.  Soon after, the newspapers report a \"bloofer lady\" attacking children.  Seward and Van Helsing investigate and find Lucy is the culprit.  Van Helsing explains to the men that Lucy is un-dead, a vampire, and she must be destroyed.  They put a stake through her heart, cut off her head, and re-seal her tomb.  Meantime, Mina hears that Jonathan has arrived in Budapest gravely ill.  She rushes to his side, nurses him, and marries him.  Jonathan entrusts his journal to Mina (who dutifully types copies).  When they return to London, the couple joins Van Helsing and the others to destroy Dracula.  Systematically, the group sanctify Dracula\'s boxes of earth (necessary for his rest) at his estate, a house in Pall Mall, and two locations in the East End.  Dracula, not to be beaten, attacks Mina and she begins to transform into a vampire.  Thwarted, Dracula flees with his last box back to his castle.  The group run him down near sunset in sight of his castle.  Harker and Morris kill Dracula.  Morris dies from wounds received and Mina recovers fully from her curse.','BL; EC; Sutherland'),

Peter Steele is the second son of a country squire near the town of Swivel-pipkin.  A bit dull but athletic, he attends Eton and Oxford where he rises quickly through the cricketing ranks as an excellent batsman: first becoming the youngest boy in his school\'s eleven and second captaining Oxford to victory over Cambridge at Lord\'s (his score of 179 being the deciding factor).  Peter\'s bachelor uncle, Charles \"Bunny\" Steele, indulges his love for cricket and includes his nephew in his own team, the Gitanos.  As a member of his uncle\'s team, Peter has other cricketing adventures, including a gentlemen-players match at the Oval, county cricket matches, and a village match between Swivel-pipkin and Padstock.  Away from cricket, Peter falls in love with Lady Emily Nipperkin, the youngest daughter of the Lord Tankerdine, a neighbouring earl.  Lord Tankerdine refuses the match due to Peter\'s lack of fortune until Bunny quietly reassures the earl that Peter is his heir.  The novel ends with the untimely death of Bunny (due to a heart attack while playing cricket) and the marriage of Peter and Lady Emily.','BL; EC'),

The novel opens with a meeting in London between the mysterious Dr. Nikola and three men: he secures their cooperation in a plot which he does not divulge.  In Sydney, Richard Hatteras, a rich young pearler, decides to spend his fortune back in England.  He sells out and takes a steamer to London: on board he meets the colonial secretary Wetherell and his daughter Phyllis.  Hatteras and Phyllis (predictably) fall in love, but her father forbids the match.  Wetherell\'s stay in London gets cut short after a disturbing sighting of Nikola.  Meantime, Hatteras coincidently meets Nikola in a restaurant, visits his baronet uncle\'s decaying estate, and rents a yacht at Bournemouth.  He chances to rescue the young Marquis of Beckenham and the two become friends.  Hatteras suspects the man\'s tutor, Mr. Baxter, is not who he seems.  Back in London he sees Baxter and Nikola meets, thereby justifying his suspicions.  Hatteras plans to return to Australia accompanied with the Marquis and Baxter.  On the way to the boat, Nikola drugs Hatteras.  He catches up with the ship in Italy but Hatteras and the Marquis are held captive in Port Said for weeks.  Finally freed, they race to Australia where they find an impostor Marquis unsuccessfully wooing Phyllis.  Hatteras exposes Baxter and the fraud.  Soon after, Phyllis is kidnapped.  Nikola wants a Chinese relic in return.  Hatteras and Wetherell track Nikola to an isolated island where they rescue Phyllis but lose the relic.  Back in Australia, a grateful Westerell allows Hatteras&mdash;now Sir Richard due to the death of his uncle&mdash;to wed his daughter.  Nikola escapes.','BL; EC'),

The previous year, Tiny fell in love with a rake, Captain Philip Foy, who shamelessly flirts with her and marries a rich woman.  In response, she accepts Lane\'s attentions and convinces herself that she loves the poor civil servant.  As a condition of her acceptance of the match, Lady Harewood requires a separation between the couple, so she takes her daughters to Italy for six months.  The romance between Land and Tiny continues through an exchange of letters.  Meantime, Lane progresses in his career: he receives a promotion in the War Office and he begins writing articles for magazines.  When the Harewoods return from Italy, Lady Harewood still opposes the match, despite Lane\'s improved prospects, but grudgingly allows the two to see each other without a formal engagement.  She promises to allow a marriage in one year on Tiny\'s next birthday in June.  During a sailing trip with family friends to Southampton, Tiny once again encounters Captain Foy (who, it turns out, did not marry) and he pays her marked attention to the annoyance of Lane.  She confesses her previous love for Foy to Lane which wounds him greatly.  The two make up however and Foy\'s marriage finally kills Tiny\'s attraction to him.  The next spring, Lady Harewood and Tiny visit Bellingham Castle where Tiny joins in the amateur theatricals as the lead opposite Reginald Macnaghten, a young lieutenant in the Guards.  The two eventually openly begin a flirtation.  When Lane joins the party, he becomes angry at Tiny\'s and Reginald\'s behavior and tells Tiny.  The two once again make up.  In June, scarlet fever delays the wedding to the fall.  The Harewoods travel to Scotland to recuperate with Lord and Lady Lothian.  When their son, Lord Lothian, arrives, Tiny\'s letters to Lane become shorter and shorter.  She eventually writes and confesses that she has feelings for the young lord and Lane writes to release her from their promise to each other.','BL; EC'),

The son of a conservative country clergyman, Reding intends to follow his father into the church by subscribing to the Thirty-nine Articles and avoiding the many competing parties at the university.  However, during his time at Oxford, Reding meets fellow students and professors who espouse different points of view about doctrinal matters.  In his search for authoritative answers, he begins to question the legitimacy of the Thirty-nine Articles, questions which his professors cannot answer to his satisfaction.  The death of his father briefly interrupts his studies and the conversion of another student, Willis, to Catholicism troubles him.  Reding\'s doubts come to the attention of his vice-principal who sends Reding away from college since his questions jeopardize the other students.  While living at home, Reding decides to convert to Catholicism, seeing in the church a true source of religious authority.  His sister, his mother, and his friends all react with dismay and anger at his decision.  On the way to London, he shares a railcar with a Catholic priest (the first he has ever met).  Other individuals, hearing of his decision, attempt last ditch efforts to dissuade him from his path.  But Reding dismisses them, goes to the Passionists Convent, and enters the Roman Catholic Church.','BL; Sutherland'),

Peter and Sally take the distraught woman to their lodgings, hoping to blackmail the would-be murderer.  Meantime, Mabel Roxton is engaged to the engineer Lionel Roy but learns that her cousin Reginald\'s embezzlement has ruined her father\'s business.  The death of Reginald\'s aunt provides a remedy: her fortune goes to Mabel on the condition that she marry her cousin.  She refuses the odious Reginald and her father is saved by a loan from Lionel.  Prevented from gaining a fortune, Reginald decides to smear Lionel\'s good name by showing Mabel the marriage certificate of Isabel.  However, Mabel believes Lionel\'s claim of never seeing the woman before.  Again witnessed by Peter and Sally, Reginald stabs Isabel and attempts to frame Lionel for her murder.  The police find her body in Lionel\'s house and he is forced to flee.  Aided by the detective Manning, Lionel unravels the conspiracy against him: Reginald took the name \"Lionel Roy\" in order to jilt Isabel but the woman had tracked him down.  Reginald\'s last desperate ploy involves kidnapping Mabel and forcing her to marry him.  Lionel and Manning rescue her and capture Reginald who is convicted of murder and hung.  A subplot involves the rehabilitation of two street urchins named Tim and Bet.','BL; EC'),

On his way there, he is lightly injured in a deadly train crash.  His first-person account of the accident becomes his successful journalistic debut.  During his time in the town, he meets Gertrude Hoffman, the daughter of a German music teacher.  Through a series of events, including the discovery of her father\'s opium addition, his intimacy with the family increases and his name becomes linked with hers in the town\'s gossip.  Ruth visits the town, but shyness prevents them from confessing their feelings for each other.  Eventually, however, they confess their love to one another.  William goes to break off his relationship with Gertrude but finds her grief-stricken over the sudden death of her father.  The journalist, unable to break her heart further, offers his protection to the bereft woman thereby engaging himself.  He writes to Ruth, who stoically accepts the situation.  William goes heavily in debt to set up a house for the extravagant and spendthrift bride.  His financial troubles lead him to accept a bribe from a lawyer to keep his client\'s name out of a story.  When his understanding editor finds out, he castigates the journalist but forgives the sin.  Unhappiness drives William to ask Ruth to run away with him&mdash;which she respectively refuses.  Unfortunately, Gertrude finds the torn fragments of William\'s rash letter to Ruth.  Feeling crushed on all sides, William disappears.  Five years pass during which Gertrude moves to Germany and dies.  An unrecognizable and ill William returns to town, reunites with Ruth, and dies.  Reviewers commended the novel\'s realistic presentation of newspaper life, details drawn no doubt from the author\'s own experience.','BL; EC'),

David used the money as the basis for his now large fortune and he hopes to consolidate his position through the marriage of his son Malcolm to the daughter of a baronet.  Malcolm refuses the match since he has already engaged himself to Lucy Harcourt, a poor seamstress he met on a train.  The furious father threatens to disown his son.  Willie confronts his uncle with his proof and the guilty man gives him some money to go away.  As a result of his son\'s and nephew\'s difficulties, David develops a scheme.  He promises his son to consider his marriage to Lucy if he goes to Calcutta for a year as a test of his love.  Malcolm agrees and departs.  While he is gone, his father bribes a clerk to woo Lucy away from Malcolm (which fails).  David then promises Willie that he will make reparations but instead has him kidnapped and taken to Panama.  Learning of the conspiracy against him at home, Malcolm returns early from India and coincidently meets a vengeful Willie in Edinburgh.  The cousins, both wronged by David, agree to confront the man by swapping cloths since Malcolm wants to hear his father confess to his crimes.  They book tickets on the fateful train to Dundee.  That night during a furious storm the bridge collapses plunging the train and its one hundred passengers into the river.  News of the disaster reaches Dundee and Malcolm is presumed dead after his luggage is found in the wreckage.  Soon after, his body is found.  The event chastens David, who confesses his schemes and repents.  However, a week later, Malcolm arrives home.  Malcolm tells them that illness forced him off the train at the last moment and that the body found was Willie\'s.  Father and son are reconciled and Malcolm marries Lucy.','BL; EC'),
