Release Date:  November, 2001  [Etext #2891]
[Yes, we are about one year ahead of schedule]

Edition:  10

*The Project Gutenberg Etext of Howards End, by E. M. Forster*
****This file should be named hoend10h.htm or hoend10h.zip****

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, hoend11h.htm

This etext was prepared by Richard Fane, Haddonfield NJ

Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after
the official publication date.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net
http://promo.net/pg


Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext01
or
ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext01

Or /etext00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding.

Something is needed to create a future for Project Gutenberg for
the next 100 years.

We need your donations more than ever!

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etexts,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Project of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"

     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.

<h3 align="center">by E. M. Forster</h3>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 1</h3>
<p>One may as well begin with Helen's letters to her sister.</p>
<blockquote>
<div align="right"><strong><em>Howards End,<br />
Tuesday.</em></strong></div>
<p><strong><em>Dearest Meg,<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It isn't going to be what we
expected.&#160; It is old and little, and altogether
delightful--red brick.&#160; We can scarcely pack in as it is, and
the dear knows what will happen when Paul (younger son) arrives
tomorrow.&#160; From hall you go right or left into dining-room or
drawing-room.&#160; Hall itself is practically a room.&#160; You
open another door in it, and there are the stairs going up in a
sort of tunnel to the first-floor.&#160; Three bedrooms in a row
there, and three attics in a row above.&#160; That isn't all the
house really, but it's all that one notices--nine windows as you
look up from the front garden.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then there's a very big wych-elm--to the
left as you look up--leaning a little over the house, and standing
on the boundary between the garden and meadow.&#160; I quite love
that tree already.&#160; Also ordinary elms, oaks--no nastier than
ordinary oaks--pear-trees, apple-trees, and a vine.&#160; No silver
birches, though.&#160; However, I must get on to my host and
hostess.&#160; I only wanted to show that it isn't the least what
we expected.&#160; Why did we settle that their house would be all
gables and wiggles, and their garden all gamboge-coloured
paths?&#160; I believe simply because we associate them with
expensive hotels--Mrs. Wilcox trailing in beautiful dresses down
long corridors, Mr. Wilcox bullying porters, etc.&#160; We females
are that unjust.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I shall be back Saturday; will let you know
train later.&#160; They are as angry as I am that you did not come
too; really Tibby is too tiresome, he starts a new mortal disease
every month.&#160; How could he have got hay fever in London?&#160;
and even if he could, it seems hard that you should give up a visit
to hear a schoolboy sneeze.&#160; Tell him that Charles Wilcox (the
son who is here) has hay fever too, but he's brave, and gets quite
cross when we inquire after it.&#160; Men like the Wilcoxes would
do Tibby a power of good.&#160; But you won't agree, and I'd better
change the subject.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This long letter is because I'm writing
before breakfast.&#160; Oh, the beautiful vine leaves!&#160; The
house is covered with a vine.&#160; I looked out earlier, and Mrs.
Wilcox was already in the garden.&#160; She evidently loves
it.&#160; No wonder she sometimes looks tired.&#160; She was
watching the large red poppies come out.&#160; Then she walked off
the lawn to the meadow, whose corner to the right I can just
see.&#160; Trail, trail, went her long dress over the sopping
grass, and she came back with her hands full of the hay that was
cut yesterday--I suppose for rabbits or something, as she kept on
smelling it.&#160; The air here is delicious.&#160; Later on I
heard the noise of croquet balls, and looked out again, and it was
Charles Wilcox practising; they are keen on all games.&#160;
Presently he started sneezing and had to stop.&#160; Then I hear
more clicketing, and it is Mr. Wilcox practising, and then,
'a-tissue, a-tissue': he has to stop too.&#160; Then Evie comes
out, and does some calisthenic exercises on a machine that is
tacked on to a greengage-tree--they put everything to use--and then
she says 'a-tissue,' and in she goes.&#160; And finally Mrs. Wilcox
reappears, trail, trail, still smelling hay and looking at the
flowers.&#160; I inflict all this on you because once you said that
life is sometimes life and sometimes only a drama, and one must
learn to distinguish t'other from which, and up to now I have
always put that down as 'Meg's clever nonsense.' But this morning,
it really does seem not life but a play, and it did amuse me
enormously to watch the W's.&#160; Now Mrs. Wilcox has come
in.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I am going to wear [omission].&#160; Last
night Mrs. Wilcox wore an [omission], and Evie [omission].&#160; So
it isn't exactly a go-as-you-please place, and if you shut your
eyes it still seems the wiggly hotel that we expected.&#160; Not if
you open them.&#160; The dog-roses are too sweet.&#160; There is a
great hedge of them over the lawn--magnificently tall, so that they
fall down in garlands, and nice and thin at the bottom, so that you
can see ducks through it and a cow.&#160; These belong to the farm,
which is the only house near us.&#160; There goes the breakfast
gong.&#160; Much love.&#160; Modified love to Tibby.&#160; Love to
Aunt Juley; how good of her to come and keep you company, but what
a bore.&#160; Burn this.&#160; Will write again
Thursday.</em></strong></p>

Friday.</em></strong></div>
<p><strong><em>Dearest Meg,<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I am having a glorious time.&#160; I like
them all.&#160; Mrs. Wilcox, if quieter than in Germany, is sweeter
than ever, and I never saw anything like her steady unselfishness,
and the best of it is that the others do not take advantage of
her.&#160; They are the very happiest, jolliest family that you can
imagine.&#160; I do really feel that we are making friends.&#160;
The fun of it is that they think me a noodle, and say so--at least
Mr. Wilcox does--and when that happens, and one doesn't mind, it's
a pretty sure test, isn't it?&#160; He says the most horrid things
about women's suffrage so nicely, and when I said I believed in
equality he just folded his arms and gave me such a setting down as
I've never had.&#160; Meg, shall we ever learn to talk less?&#160;
I never felt so ashamed of myself in my life.&#160; I couldn't
point to a time when men had been equal, nor even to a time when
the wish to be equal had made them happier in other ways.&#160; I
couldn't say a word.&#160; I had just picked up the notion that
equality is good from some book--probably from poetry, or
you.&#160; Anyhow, it's been knocked into pieces, and, like all
people who are really strong, Mr. Wilcox did it without hurting
me.&#160; On the other hand, I laugh at them for catching hay
fever.&#160; We live like fighting-cocks, and Charles takes us out
every day in the motor--a tomb with trees in it, a hermit's house,
a wonderful road that was made by the Kings of Mercia--tennis--a
cricket match--bridge--and at night we squeeze up in this lovely
house.&#160; The whole clan's here now--it's like a rabbit
warren.&#160; Evie is a dear.&#160; They want me to stop over
Sunday--I suppose it won't matter if I do.&#160; Marvellous weather
and the view's marvellous--views westward to the high ground.&#160;
Thank you for your letter.&#160; Burn this.</em></strong></p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter 2</h3>
<p>Margaret glanced at her sister's note and pushed it over the
breakfast-table to her aunt.&#160; There was a moment's hush, and
then the flood-gates opened.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I can tell you nothing, Aunt Juley.&#160;
I know no more than you do.&#160; We met--we only met the father
and mother abroad last spring.&#160; I know so little that I didn't
even know their son's name.&#160; It's all so--" She waved her hand
and laughed a little.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In that case it is far too sudden."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Who knows, Aunt Juley, who knows?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But, Margaret dear, I mean we mustn't be
unpractical now that we've come to facts.&#160; It is too sudden,
surely."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Who knows!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But Margaret dear--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'll go for her other letters," said
Margaret.&#160; "No, I won't, I'll finish my breakfast.&#160; In
fact, I haven't them.&#160; We met the Wilcoxes on an awful
expedition that we made from Heidelberg to Speyer.&#160; Helen and
I had got it into our heads that there was a grand old cathedral at
Speyer--the Archbishop of Speyer was one of the seven electors--you
know--'Speyer, Maintz, and K&#246;ln.' Those three sees once
commanded the Rhine Valley and got it the name of Priest
Street."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I still feel quite uneasy about this
business, Margaret."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The train crossed by a bridge of boats,
and at first sight it looked quite fine.&#160; But oh, in five
minutes we had seen the whole thing.&#160; The cathedral had been
ruined, absolutely ruined, by restoration; not an inch left of the
original structure.&#160; We wasted a whole day, and came across
the Wilcoxes as we were eating our sandwiches in the public
gardens.&#160; They too, poor things, had been taken in--they were
actually stopping at Speyer--and they rather liked Helen insisting
that they must fly with us to Heidelberg.&#160; As a matter of
fact, they did come on next day.&#160; We all took some drives
together.&#160; They knew us well enough to ask Helen to come and
see them--at least, I was asked too, but Tibby's illness prevented
me, so last Monday she went alone.&#160; That's all.&#160; You know
as much as I do now.&#160; It's a young man out the unknown.&#160;
She was to have come back Saturday, but put off till Monday,
perhaps on account of--I don't know.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She broke off, and listened to the sounds
of a London morning.&#160; Their house was in Wickham Place, and
fairly quiet, for a lofty promontory of buildings separated it from
the main thoroughfare.&#160; One had the sense of a backwater, or
rather of an estuary, whose waters flowed in from the invisible
sea, and ebbed into a profound silence while the waves without were
still beating.&#160; Though the promontory consisted of
flats--expensive, with cavernous entrance halls, full of concierges
and palms--it fulfilled its purpose, and gained for the older
houses opposite a certain measure of peace.&#160; These, too, would
be swept away in time, and another promontory would rise upon their
site, as humanity piled itself higher and higher on the precious
soil of London.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Munt had her own method of
interpreting her nieces.&#160; She decided that Margaret was a
little hysterical, and was trying to gain time by a torrent of
talk.&#160; Feeling very diplomatic, she lamented the fate of
Speyer, and declared that never, never should she be so misguided
as to visit it, and added of her own accord that the principles of
restoration were ill understood in Germany.&#160; "The Germans,"
she said, "are too thorough, and this is all very well sometimes,
but at other times it does not do."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Exactly," said Margaret; "Germans are too
thorough." And her eyes began to shine.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Of course I regard you Schlegels as
English," said Mrs. Munt hastily--"English to the backbone."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret leaned forward and stroked her
hand.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And that reminds me--Helen's
letter--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, yes, Aunt Juley, I am thinking all
right about Helen's letter.&#160; I know--I must go down and see
her.&#160; I am thinking about her all right.&#160; I am meaning to
go down"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But go with some plan," said Mrs. Munt,
admitting into her kindly voice a note of exasperation.&#160;
"Margaret, if I may interfere, don't be taken by surprise.&#160;
What do you think of the Wilcoxes?&#160; Are they our sort?&#160;
Are they likely people?&#160; Could they appreciate Helen, who is
to my mind a very special sort of person?&#160; Do they care about
Literature and Art?&#160; That is most important when you come to
think of it.&#160; Literature and Art.&#160; Most important.&#160;
How old would the son be?&#160; She says 'younger son.' Would he be
in a position to marry?&#160; Is he likely to make Helen
happy?&#160; Did you gather--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I gathered nothing."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They began to talk at once.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then in that case--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In that case I can make no plans, don't
you see."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"On the contrary--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I hate plans.&#160; I hate lines of
action.&#160; Helen isn't a baby."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then in that case, my dear, why go
down?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret was silent.&#160; If her aunt
could not see why she must go down, she was not going to tell
her.&#160; She was not going to say "I love my dear sister; I must
be near her at this crisis of her life."&#160; The affections are
more reticent than the passions, and their expression more
subtle.&#160; If she herself should ever fall in love with a man,
she, like Helen, would proclaim it from the house-tops, but as she
only loved a sister she used the voiceless language of
sympathy.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I consider you odd girls," continued Mrs.
Munt, "and very wonderful girls, and in many ways far older than
your years.&#160; But--you won't be offended?&#160;--frankly I feel
you are not up to this business.&#160; It requires an older
person.&#160; Dear, I have nothing to call me back to Swanage." She
spread out her plump arms.&#160; "I am all at your disposal.&#160;
Let me go down to this house whose name I forget instead of
you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Aunt Juley"--she jumped up and kissed
her--"I must, must go to Howards End myself.&#160; You don't
exactly understand, though I can never thank you properly for
offering."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I do understand," retorted Mrs. Munt, with
immense confidence.&#160; "I go down in no spirit of interference,
but to make inquiries.&#160; Inquiries are necessary.&#160; Now, I
am going to be rude.&#160; You would say the wrong thing; to a
certainty you would.&#160; In your anxiety for Helen's happiness
you would offend the whole of these Wilcoxes by asking one of your
impetuous questions--not that one minds offending them."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I shall ask no questions.&#160; I have it
in Helen's writing that she and a man are in love.&#160; There is
no question to ask as long as she keeps to that.&#160; All the rest
isn't worth a straw.&#160; A long engagement if you like, but
inquiries, questions, plans, lines of action--no, Aunt Juley,
no."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Away she hurried, not beautiful, not
supremely brilliant, but filled with something that took the place
of both qualities--something best described as a profound vivacity,
a continual and sincere response to all that she encountered in her
path through life.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If Helen had written the same to me about
a shop-assistant or a penniless clerk--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Dear Margaret, do come into the library
and shut the door.&#160; Your good maids are dusting the
banisters."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"--or if she had wanted to marry the man
who calls for Carter Paterson, I should have said the same." Then,
with one of those turns that convinced her aunt that she was not
mad really and convinced observers of another type that she was not
a barren theorist, she added: "Though in the case of Carter
Paterson I should want it to be a very long engagement indeed, I
must say."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I should think so," said Mrs. Munt; "and,
indeed, I can scarcely follow you.&#160; Now, just imagine if you
said anything of that sort to the Wilcoxes.&#160; I understand it,
but most good people would think you mad.&#160; Imagine how
disconcerting for Helen!&#160; What is wanted is a person who will
go slowly, slowly in this business, and see how things are and
where they are likely to lead to."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret was down on this.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But you implied just now that the
engagement must be broken off."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I think probably it must; but
slowly."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Can you break an engagement off
slowly?"&#160; Her eyes lit up.&#160; "What's an engagement made
of, do you suppose?&#160; I think it's made of some hard stuff,
that may snap, but can't break.&#160; It is different to the other
ties of life.&#160; They stretch or bend.&#160; They admit of
degree.&#160; They're different."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Exactly so.&#160; But won't you let me
just run down to Howards House, and save you all the
discomfort?&#160; I will really not interfere, but I do so
thoroughly understand the kind of thing you Schlegels want that one
quiet look round will be enough for me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret again thanked her, again kissed
her, and then ran upstairs to see her brother.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He was not so well.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The hay fever had worried him a good deal
all night.&#160; His head ached, his eyes were wet, his mucous
membrane, he informed her, was in a most unsatisfactory
condition.&#160; The only thing that made life worth living was the
thought of Walter Savage Landor, from whose <em>Imaginary
Conversations</em> she had promised to read at frequent intervals
during the day.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was rather difficult.&#160; Something
must be done about Helen.&#160; She must be assured that it is not
a criminal offence to love at first sight.&#160; A telegram to this
effect would be cold and cryptic, a personal visit seemed each
moment more impossible.&#160; Now the doctor arrived, and said that
Tibby was quite bad.&#160; Might it really be best to accept Aunt
Juley's kind offer, and to send her down to Howards End with a
note?&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Certainly Margaret was impulsive.&#160; She
did swing rapidly from one decision to another.&#160; Running
downstairs into the library, she cried--"Yes, I have changed my
mind; I do wish that you would go."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There was a train from King's Cross at
eleven.&#160; At half-past ten Tibby, with rare self-effacement,
fell asleep, and Margaret was able to drive her aunt to the
station.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You will remember, Aunt Juley, not to be
drawn into discussing the engagement.&#160; Give my letter to
Helen, and say whatever you feel yourself, but do keep clear of the
relatives.&#160; We have scarcely got their names straight yet, and
besides, that sort of thing is so uncivilized and wrong.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So uncivilized?" queried Mrs. Munt,
fearing that she was losing the point of some brilliant
remark.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, I used an affected word.&#160; I only
meant would you please only talk the thing over with Helen."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Only with Helen."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Because--" But it was no moment to expound
the personal nature of love.&#160; Even Margaret shrank from it,
and contented herself with stroking her good aunt's hand, and with
meditating, half sensibly and half poetically, on the journey that
was about to begin from King's Cross.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like many others who have lived long in a
great capital, she had strong feelings about the various railway
termini.&#160; They are our gates to the glorious and the
unknown.&#160; Through them we pass out into adventure and
sunshine, to them alas!&#160; we return.&#160; In Paddington all
Cornwall is latent and the remoter west; down the inclines of
Liverpool Street lie fenlands and the illimitable Broads; Scotland
is through the pylons of Euston; Wessex behind the poised chaos of
Waterloo.&#160; Italians realize this, as is natural; those of them
who are so unfortunate as to serve as waiters in Berlin call the
Anhalt Bahnhof the Stazione d'Italia, because by it they must
return to their homes.&#160; And he is a chilly Londoner who does
not endow his stations with some personality, and extend to them,
however shyly, the emotions of fear and love.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To Margaret--I hope that it will not set
the reader against her--the station of King's Cross had always
suggested Infinity.&#160; Its very situation--withdrawn a little
behind the facile splendours of St. Pancras--implied a comment on
the materialism of life.&#160; Those two great arches, colourless,
indifferent, shouldering between them an unlovely clock, were fit
portals for some eternal adventure, whose issue might be
prosperous, but would certainly not be expressed in the ordinary
language of prosperity.&#160; If you think this ridiculous,
remember that it is not Margaret who is telling you about it; and
let me hasten to add that they were in plenty of time for the
train; that Mrs. Munt, though she took a second-class ticket, was
put by the guard into a first (only two seconds on the train, one
smoking and the other babies--one cannot be expected to travel with
babies); and that Margaret, on her return to Wickham Place, was
confronted with the following telegram:</p>
<blockquote><strong><em>All over.&#160; Wish I had never
written.&#160; Tell no one.</em></strong><br />
<div align="right">
<strong><em>--Helen&#160;&#160;</em></strong></div>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Aunt Juley was gone--gone
irrevocably, and no power on earth could stop her.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 3</h3>
<p>Most complacently did Mrs. Munt rehearse her mission.&#160; Her
nieces were independent young women, and it was not often that she
was able to help them.&#160; Emily's daughters had never been quite
like other girls.&#160; They had been left motherless when Tibby
was born, when Helen was five and Margaret herself but
thirteen.&#160; It was before the passing of the Deceased Wife's
Sister Bill, so Mrs. Munt could without impropriety offer to go and
keep house at Wickham Place.&#160; But her brother-in-law, who was
peculiar and a German, had referred the question to Margaret, who
with the crudity of youth had answered, "No, they could manage much
better alone." Five years later Mr. Schlegel had died too, and Mrs.
Munt had repeated her offer.&#160; Margaret, crude no longer, had
been grateful and extremely nice, but the substance of her answer
had been the same.&#160; "I must not interfere a third time,"
thought Mrs. Munt.&#160; However, of course she did.&#160; She
learnt, to her horror, that Margaret, now of age, was taking her
money out of the old safe investments and putting it into Foreign
Things, which always smash.&#160; Silence would have been
criminal.&#160; Her own fortune was invested in Home Rails, and
most ardently did she beg her niece to imitate her.&#160; "Then we
should be together, dear." Margaret, out of politeness, invested a
few hundreds in the Nottingham and Derby Railway, and though the
Foreign Things did admirably and the Nottingham and Derby declined
with the steady dignity of which only Home Rails are capable, Mrs.
Munt never ceased to rejoice, and to say, "I did manage that, at
all events.&#160; When the smash comes poor Margaret will have a
nest-egg to fall back upon." This year Helen came of age, and
exactly the same thing happened in Helen's case; she also would
shift her money out of Consols, but she, too, almost without being
pressed, consecrated a fraction of it to the Nottingham and Derby
Railway.&#160; So far so good, but in social matters their aunt had
accomplished nothing.&#160; Sooner or later the girls would enter
on the process known as throwing themselves away, and if they had
delayed hitherto, it was only that they might throw themselves more
vehemently in the future.&#160; They saw too many people at Wickham
Place--unshaven musicians, an actress even, German cousins (one
knows what foreigners are), acquaintances picked up at Continental
hotels (one knows what they are too).&#160; It was interesting, and
down at Swanage no one appreciated culture more than Mrs. Munt; but
it was dangerous, and disaster was bound to come.&#160; How right
she was, and how lucky to be on the spot when the disaster
came!&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The train sped northward, under innumerable
tunnels.&#160; It was only an hour's journey, but Mrs. Munt had to
raise and lower the window again and again.&#160; She passed
through the South Welwyn Tunnel, saw light for a moment, and
entered the North Welwyn Tunnel, of tragic fame.&#160; She
traversed the immense viaduct, whose arches span untroubled meadows
and the dreamy flow of Tewin Water.&#160; She skirted the parks of
politicians.&#160; At times the Great North Road accompanied her,
more suggestive of infinity than any railway, awakening, after a
nap of a hundred years, to such life as is conferred by the stench
of motor-cars, and to such culture as is implied by the
advertisements of antibilious pills.&#160; To history, to tragedy,
to the past, to the future, Mrs. Munt remained equally indifferent;
hers but to concentrate on the end of her journey, and to rescue
poor Helen from this dreadful mess.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The station for Howards End was at Hilton,
one of the large villages that are strung so frequently along the
North Road, and that owe their size to the traffic of coaching and
pre-coaching days.&#160; Being near London, it had not shared in
the rural decay, and its long High Street had budded out right and
left into residential estates.&#160; For about a mile a series of
tiled and slated houses passed before Mrs. Munt's inattentive eyes,
a series broken at one point by six Danish tumuli that stood
shoulder to shoulder along the highroad, tombs of soldiers.&#160;
Beyond these tumuli habitations thickened, and the train came to a
standstill in a tangle that was almost a town.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The station, like the scenery, like Helen's
letters, struck an indeterminate note.&#160; Into which country
will it lead, England or Suburbia?&#160; It was new, it had island
platforms and a subway, and the superficial comfort exacted by
business men.&#160; But it held hints of local life, personal
intercourse, as even Mrs. Munt was to discover.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I want a house," she confided to the
ticket boy.&#160; "Its name is Howards Lodge.&#160; Do you know
where it is?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Mr. Wilcox!" the boy called.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A young man in front of them turned
round.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She's wanting Howards End."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There was nothing for it but to go forward,
though Mrs. Munt was too much agitated even to stare at the
stranger.&#160; But remembering that there were two brothers, she
had the sense to say to him, "Excuse me asking, but are you the
younger Mr. Wilcox or the elder?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The younger.&#160; Can I do anything for
you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, well"--she controlled herself with
difficulty.&#160; "Really.&#160; Are you?&#160; I--"&#160; She
moved away from the ticket boy and lowered her voice.&#160; "I am
Miss Schlegels aunt.&#160; I ought to introduce myself, oughtn't
I?&#160; My name is Mrs. Munt."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She was conscious that he raised his cap
and said quite coolly, "Oh, rather; Miss Schlegel is stopping with
us.&#160; Did you want to see her?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Possibly--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'll call you a cab.&#160; No; wait a
mo--" He thought.&#160; "Our motor's here.&#160; I'll run you up in
it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That is very kind--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not at all, if you'll just wait till they
bring out a parcel from the office.&#160; This way."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"My niece is not with you by any
chance?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No; I came over with my father.&#160; He
has gone on north in your train.&#160; You'll see Miss Schlegel at
lunch.&#160; You're coming up to lunch, I hope?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I should like to come <em>up</em>," said
Mrs. Munt, not committing herself to nourishment until she had
studied Helen's lover a little more.&#160; He seemed a gentleman,
but had so rattled her round that her powers of observation were
numbed.&#160; She glanced at him stealthily.&#160; To a feminine
eye there was nothing amiss in the sharp depressions at the corners
of his mouth, nor in the rather box-like construction of his
forehead.&#160; He was dark, clean-shaven and seemed accustomed to
command.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In front or behind?&#160; Which do you
prefer?&#160; It may be windy in front."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In front if I may; then we can
talk."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But excuse me one moment--I can't think
what they're doing with that parcel." He strode into the
booking-office and called with a new voice: "Hi!&#160; hi, you
there!&#160; Are you going to keep me waiting all day?&#160; Parcel
for Wilcox, Howards End.&#160; Just look sharp!"&#160; Emerging, he
said in quieter tones: "This station's abominably organized; if I
had my way, the whole lot of 'em should get the sack.&#160; May I
help you in?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"This is very good of you," said Mrs. Munt,
as she settled herself into a luxurious cavern of red leather, and
suffered her person to be padded with rugs and shawls.&#160; She
was more civil than she had intended, but really this young man was
very kind.&#160; Moreover, she was a little afraid of him: his
self-possession was extraordinary.&#160; "Very good indeed," she
repeated, adding: "It is just what I should have wished."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Very good of you to say so," he replied,
with a slight look of surprise, which, like most slight looks,
escaped Mrs. Munt's attention.&#160; "I was just tooling my father
over to catch the down train."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You see, we heard from Helen this
morning."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Young Wilcox was pouring in petrol,
starting his engine, and performing other actions with which this
story has no concern.&#160; The great car began to rock, and the
form of Mrs. Munt, trying to explain things, sprang agreeably up
and down among the red cushions.&#160; "The mater will be very glad
to see you," he mumbled.&#160; "Hi!&#160; I say.&#160; Parcel for
Howards End.&#160; Bring it out.&#160; Hi!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A bearded porter emerged with the parcel in
one hand and an entry book in the other.&#160; With the gathering
whir of the motor these ejaculations mingled: "Sign, must I?&#160;
Why the--should I sign after all this bother?&#160; Not even got a
pencil on you?&#160; Remember next time I report you to the
station-master.&#160; My time's of value, though yours mayn't
be.&#160; Here"--here being a tip.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Extremely sorry, Mrs. Munt."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not at all, Mr. Wilcox."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And do you object to going through the
village?&#160; It is rather a longer spin, but I have one or two
commissions."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I should love going through the
village.&#160; Naturally I am very anxious to talk things over with
you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As she said this she felt ashamed, for she
was disobeying Margaret's instructions.&#160; Only disobeying them
in the letter, surely.&#160; Margaret had only warned her against
discussing the incident with outsiders.&#160; Surely it was not
"uncivilized or wrong" to discuss it with the young man himself,
since chance had thrown them together.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A reticent fellow, he made no reply.&#160;
Mounting by her side, he put on gloves and spectacles, and off they
drove, the bearded porter--life is a mysterious business--looking
after them with admiration.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The wind was in their faces down the
station road, blowing the dust into Mrs. Munt's eyes.&#160; But as
soon as they turned into the Great North Road she opened
fire.&#160; "You can well imagine," she said, "that the news was a
great shock to us."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What news?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Mr. Wilcox," she said frankly.&#160;
"Margaret has told me everything--everything.&#160; I have seen
Helen's letter."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He could not look her in the face, as his
eyes were fixed on his work; he was travelling as quickly as he
dared down the High Street.&#160; But he inclined his head in her
direction, and said, "I beg your pardon; I didn't catch."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"About Helen.&#160; Helen, of course.&#160;
Helen is a very exceptional person--I am sure you will let me say
this, feeling towards her as you do--indeed, all the Schlegels are
exceptional.&#160; I come in no spirit of interference, but it was
a great shock."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They drew up opposite a draper's.&#160;
Without replying, he turned round in his seat, and contemplated the
cloud of dust that they had raised in their passage through the
village.&#160; It was settling again, but not all into the road
from which he had taken it.&#160; Some of it had percolated through
the open windows, some had whitened the roses and gooseberries of
the wayside gardens, while a certain proportion had entered the
lungs of the villagers.&#160; "I wonder when they'll learn wisdom
and tar the roads," was his comment.&#160; Then a man ran out of
the draper's with a roll of oilcloth, and off they went
again.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Margaret could not come herself, on
account of poor Tibby, so I am here to represent her and to have a
good talk."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'm sorry to be so dense," said the young
man, again drawing up outside a shop.&#160; "But I still haven't
quite understood."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Helen, Mr. Wilcox--my niece and
you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He pushed up his goggles and gazed at her,
absolutely bewildered.&#160; Horror smote her to the heart, for
even she began to suspect that they were at cross-purposes, and
that she had commenced her mission by some hideous blunder.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Miss Schlegel and myself." he asked,
compressing his lips.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I trust there has been no
misunderstanding," quavered Mrs. Munt.&#160; "Her letter certainly
read that way."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What way?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That you and she--" She paused, then
drooped her eyelids.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I think I catch your meaning," he said
stickily.&#160; "What an extraordinary mistake!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then you didn't the least--" she
stammered, getting blood-red in the face, and wishing she had never
been born.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Scarcely, as I am already engaged to
another lady." There was a moment's silence, and then he caught his
breath and exploded with, "Oh, good God!&#160; Don't tell me it's
some silliness of Paul's."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But you are Paul."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'm not."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then why did you say so at the
station?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I said nothing of the sort."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I beg your pardon, you did."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I beg your pardon, I did not.&#160; My
name is Charles."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Younger" may mean son as opposed to
father, or second brother as opposed to first.&#160; There is much
to be said for either view, and later on they said it.&#160; But
they had other questions before them now.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do you mean to tell me that Paul--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But she did not like his voice.&#160; He
sounded as if he was talking to a porter, and, certain that he had
deceived her at the station, she too grew angry.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do you mean to tell me that Paul and your
niece--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Munt--such is human nature--determined
that she would champion the lovers.&#160; She was not going to be
bullied by a severe young man.&#160; "Yes, they care for one
another very much indeed," she said.&#160; "I dare say they will
tell you about it by-and-by.&#160; We heard this morning."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And Charles clenched his fist and cried,
"The idiot, the idiot, the little fool!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Munt tried to divest herself of her
rugs.&#160; "If that is your attitude, Mr. Wilcox, I prefer to
walk."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I beg you will do no such thing.&#160;
I'll take you up this moment to the house.&#160; Let me tell you
the thing's impossible, and must be stopped."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Munt did not often lose her temper,
and when she did it was only to protect those whom she loved.&#160;
On this occasion she blazed out.&#160; "I quite agree, sir.&#160;
The thing is impossible, and I will come up and stop it.&#160; My
niece is a very exceptional person, and I am not inclined to sit
still while she throws herself away on those who will not
appreciate her."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles worked his jaws.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Considering she has only known your
brother since Wednesday, and only met your father and mother at a
stray hotel--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Could you possibly lower your voice?&#160;
The shopman will overhear."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Esprit de classe"--if one may coin the
phrase--was strong in Mrs. Munt.&#160; She sat quivering while a
member of the lower orders deposited a metal funnel, a saucepan,
and a garden squirt beside the roll of oilcloth.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Right behind?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, sir." And the lower orders vanished
in a cloud of dust.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I warn you: Paul hasn't a penny; it's
useless."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No need to warn us, Mr. Wilcox, I assure
you.&#160; The warning is all the other way.&#160; My niece has
been very foolish, and I shall give her a good scolding and take
her back to London with me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He has to make his way out in
Nigeria.&#160; He couldn't think of marrying for years and when he
does it must be a woman who can stand the climate, and is in other
ways--Why hasn't he told us?&#160; Of course he's ashamed.&#160; He
knows he's been a fool.&#160; And so he has--a damned fool."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She grew furious.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Whereas Miss Schlegel has lost no time in
publishing the news."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If I were a man, Mr. Wilcox, for that last
remark I'd box your ears.&#160; You're not fit to clean my niece's
boots, to sit in the same room with her, and you dare--you actually
dare--I decline to argue with such a person."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"All I know is, she's spread the thing and
he hasn't, and my father's away and I--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And all that I know is--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Might I finish my sentence, please?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles clenched his teeth and sent the
motor swerving all over the lane.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She screamed.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So they played the game of Capping
Families, a round of which is always played when love would unite
two members of our race.&#160; But they played it with unusual
vigour, stating in so many words that Schlegels were better than
Wilcoxes, Wilcoxes better than Schlegels.&#160; They flung decency
aside.&#160; The man was young, the woman deeply stirred; in both a
vein of coarseness was latent.&#160; Their quarrel was no more
surprising than are most quarrels--inevitable at the time,
incredible afterwards.&#160; But it was more than usually
futile.&#160; A few minutes, and they were enlightened.&#160; The
motor drew up at Howards End, and Helen, looking very pale, ran out
to meet her aunt.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Aunt Juley, I have just had a telegram
from Margaret; I--I meant to stop your coming.&#160; It isn't--it's
over."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The climax was too much for Mrs.
Munt.&#160; She burst into tears.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Aunt Juley dear, don't.&#160; Don't let
them know I've been so silly.&#160; It wasn't anything.&#160; Do
bear up for my sake."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Paul," cried Charles Wilcox, pulling his
gloves off.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Don't let them know.&#160; They are never
to know."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, my darling Helen--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Paul!&#160; Paul!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A very young man came out of the
house.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Paul, is there any truth in this?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I didn't--I don't--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes or no, man; plain question, plain
answer.&#160; Did or didn't Miss Schlegel--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Charles dear," said a voice from the
garden.&#160; "Charles, dear Charles, one doesn't ask plain
questions.&#160; There aren't such things."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They were all silent.&#160; It was Mrs.
Wilcox.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She approached just as Helen's letter had
described her, trailing noiselessly over the lawn, and there was
actually a wisp of hay in her hands.&#160; She seemed to belong not
to the young people and their motor, but to the house, and to the
tree that overshadowed it.&#160; One knew that she worshipped the
past, and that the instinctive wisdom the past can alone bestow had
descended upon her--that wisdom to which we give the clumsy name of
aristocracy.&#160; High born she might not be.&#160; But assuredly
she cared about her ancestors, and let them help her.&#160; When
she saw Charles angry, Paul frightened, and Mrs. Munt in tears, she
heard her ancestors say, "Separate those human beings who will hurt
each other most.&#160; The rest can wait." So she did not ask
questions.&#160; Still less did she pretend that nothing had
happened, as a competent society hostess would have done.&#160; She
said, "Miss Schlegel, would you take your aunt up to your room or
to my room, whichever you think best.&#160; Paul, do find Evie, and
tell her lunch for six, but I'm not sure whether we shall all be
downstairs for it." And when they had obeyed her, she turned to her
elder son, who still stood in the throbbing stinking car, and
smiled at him with tenderness, and without a word, turned away from
him towards her flowers.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Mother," he called, "are you aware that
Paul has been playing the fool again?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's all right, dear.&#160; They have
broken off the engagement."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Engagement--!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"They do not love any longer, if you prefer
it put that way," said Mrs. Wilcox, stooping down to smell a
rose.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 4</h3>
<p>Helen and her aunt returned to Wickham Place in a state of
collapse, and for a little time Margaret had three invalids on her
hands.&#160; Mrs. Munt soon recovered.&#160; She possessed to a
remarkable degree the power of distorting the past, and before many
days were over she had forgotten the part played by her own
imprudence in the catastrophe.&#160; Even at the crisis she had
cried, "Thank goodness, poor Margaret is saved this!" which during
the journey to London evolved into, "It had to be gone through by
someone," which in its turn ripened into the permanent form of "The
one time I really did help Emily's girls was over the Wilcox
business."&#160; But Helen was a more serious patient.&#160; New
ideas had burst upon her like a thunder clap, and by them and by
her reverberations she had been stunned.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The truth was that she had fallen in love,
not with an individual, but with a family.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Before Paul arrived she had, as it were,
been tuned up into his key.&#160; The energy of the Wilcoxes had
fascinated her, had created new images of beauty in her responsive
mind.&#160; To be all day with them in the open air, to sleep at
night under their roof, had seemed the supreme joy of life, and had
led to that abandonment of personality that is a possible prelude
to love.&#160; She had liked giving in to Mr. Wilcox, or Evie, or
Charles; she had liked being told that her notions of life were
sheltered or academic; that Equality was nonsense, Votes for Women
nonsense, Socialism nonsense, Art and Literature, except when
conducive to strengthening the character, nonsense.&#160; One by
one the Schlegel fetiches had been overthrown, and, though
professing to defend them, she had rejoiced.&#160; When Mr. Wilcox
said that one sound man of business did more good to the world than
a dozen of your social reformers, she had swallowed the curious
assertion without a gasp, and had leant back luxuriously among the
cushions of his motor-car.&#160; When Charles said, "Why be so
polite to servants?&#160; they don't understand it," she had not
given the Schlegel retort of, "If they don't understand it, I do."
No; she had vowed to be less polite to servants in the
future.&#160; "I am swathed in cant," she thought, "and it is good
for me to be stripped of it." And all that she thought or did or
breathed was a quiet preparation for Paul.&#160; Paul was
inevitable.&#160; Charles was taken up with another girl, Mr.
Wilcox was so old, Evie so young, Mrs. Wilcox so different.&#160;
Round the absent brother she began to throw the halo of Romance, to
irradiate him with all the splendour of those happy days, to feel
that in him she should draw nearest to the robust ideal.&#160; He
and she were about the same age, Evie said.&#160; Most people
thought Paul handsomer than his brother.&#160; He was certainly a
better shot, though not so good at golf.&#160; And when Paul
appeared, flushed with the triumph of getting through an
examination, and ready to flirt with any pretty girl, Helen met him
halfway, or more than halfway, and turned towards him on the Sunday
evening.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He had been talking of his approaching
exile in Nigeria, and he should have continued to talk of it, and
allowed their guest to recover.&#160; But the heave of her bosom
flattered him.&#160; Passion was possible, and he became
passionate.&#160; Deep down in him something whispered, "This girl
would let you kiss her; you might not have such a chance
again."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That was "how it happened," or, rather, how
Helen described it to her sister, using words even more
unsympathetic than my own.&#160; But the poetry of that kiss, the
wonder of it, the magic that there was in life for hours after
it--who can describe that?&#160; It is so easy for an Englishman to
sneer at these chance collisions of human beings.&#160; To the
insular cynic and the insular moralist they offer an equal
opportunity.&#160; It is so easy to talk of "passing emotion," and
how to forget how vivid the emotion was ere it passed.&#160; Our
impulse to sneer, to forget, is at root a good one.&#160; We
recognize that emotion is not enough, and that men and women are
personalities capable of sustained relations, not mere
opportunities for an electrical discharge.&#160; Yet we rate the
impulse too highly.&#160; We do not admit that by collisions of
this trivial sort the doors of heaven may be shaken open.&#160; To
Helen, at all events, her life was to bring nothing more intense
than the embrace of this boy who played no part in it.&#160; He had
drawn her out of the house, where there was danger of surprise and
light; he had led her by a path he knew, until they stood under the
column of the vast wych-elm.&#160; A man in the darkness, he had
whispered "I love you" when she was desiring love.&#160; In time
his slender personality faded, the scene that he had evoked
endured.&#160; In all the variable years that followed she never
saw the like of it again.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I understand," said Margaret--"at least, I
understand as much as ever is understood of these things.&#160;
Tell me now what happened on the Monday morning."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It was over at once."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How, Helen?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I was still happy while I dressed, but as
I came downstairs I got nervous, and when I went into the
dining-room I knew it was no good.&#160; There was Evie--I can't
explain--managing the tea-urn, and Mr. Wilcox reading the
<em>Times</em>."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Was Paul there?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes; and Charles was talking to him about
Stocks and Shares, and he looked frightened."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By slight indications the sisters could
convey much to each other.&#160; Margaret saw horror latent in the
scene, and Helen's next remark did not surprise her.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Somehow, when that kind of man looks
frightened it is too awful.&#160; It is all right for us to be
frightened, or for men of another sort--father, for instance; but
for men like that!&#160; When I saw all the others so placid, and
Paul mad with terror in case I said the wrong thing, I felt for a
moment that the whole Wilcox family was a fraud, just a wall of
newspapers and motor-cars and golf-clubs, and that if it fell I
should find nothing behind it but panic and emptiness.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't think that.&#160; The Wilcoxes
struck me as being genuine people, particularly the wife."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, I don't really think that.&#160; But
Paul was so broad-shouldered; all kinds of extraordinary things
made it worse, and I knew that it would never do--never.&#160; I
said to him after breakfast, when the others were practising
strokes, 'We rather lost our heads,' and he looked better at once,
though frightfully ashamed.&#160; He began a speech about having no
money to marry on, but it hurt him to make it, and I--stopped
him.&#160; Then he said, 'I must beg your pardon over this, Miss
Schlegel; I can't think what came over me last night.' And I said,
'Nor what over me; never mind.' And then we parted--at least, until
I remembered that I had written straight off to tell you the night
before, and that frightened him again.&#160; I asked him to send a
telegram for me, for he knew you would be coming or something; and
he tried to get hold of the motor, but Charles and Mr. Wilcox
wanted it to go to the station; and Charles offered to send the
telegram for me, and then I had to say that the telegram was of no
consequence, for Paul said Charles might read it, and though I
wrote it out several times, he always said people would suspect
something.&#160; He took it himself at last, pretending that he
must walk down to get cartridges, and, what with one thing and the
other, it was not handed in at the Post Office until too
late.&#160; It was the most terrible morning.&#160; Paul disliked
me more and more, and Evie talked cricket averages till I nearly
screamed.&#160; I cannot think how I stood her all the other
days.&#160; At last Charles and his father started for the station,
and then came your telegram warning me that Aunt Juley was coming
by that train, and Paul--oh, rather horrible--said that I had
muddled it. But Mrs. Wilcox knew."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Knew what?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Everything; though we neither of us told
her a word, and had known all along, I think."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, she must have overheard you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I suppose so, but it seemed wonderful.
When Charles and Aunt Juley drove up, calling each other names,
Mrs. Wilcox stepped in from the garden and made everything less
terrible.&#160; Ugh!&#160; but it has been a disgusting
business.&#160; To think that--" She sighed.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"To think that because you and a young man
meet for a moment, there must be all these telegrams and anger,"
supplied Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen nodded.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I've often thought about it, Helen.&#160;
It's one of the most interesting things in the world.&#160; The
truth is that there is a great outer life that you and I have never
touched--a life in which telegrams and anger count.&#160; Personal
relations, that we think supreme, are not supreme there.&#160;
There love means marriage settlements, death, death duties.&#160;
So far I'm clear.&#160; But here my difficulty.&#160; This outer
life, though obviously horrid, often seems the real one--there's
grit in it.&#160; It does breed character.&#160; Do personal
relations lead to sloppiness in the end?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, Meg, that's what I felt, only not so
clearly, when the Wilcoxes were so competent, and seemed to have
their hands on all the ropes.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Don't you feel it now?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I remember Paul at breakfast," said Helen
quietly.&#160; "I shall never forget him.&#160; He had nothing to
fall back upon.&#160; I know that personal relations are the real
life, for ever and ever.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Amen!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So the Wilcox episode fell into the
background, leaving behind it memories of sweetness and horror that
mingled, and the sisters pursued the life that Helen had
commended.&#160; They talked to each other and to other people,
they filled the tall thin house at Wickham Place with those whom
they liked or could befriend.&#160; They even attended public
meetings.&#160; In their own fashion they cared deeply about
politics, though not as politicians would have us care; they
desired that public life should mirror whatever is good in the life
within.&#160; Temperance, tolerance, and sexual equality were
intelligible cries to them; whereas they did not follow our Forward
Policy in Thibet with the keen attention that it merits, and would
at times dismiss the whole British Empire with a puzzled, if
reverent, sigh.&#160; Not out of them are the shows of history
erected: the world would be a grey, bloodless place were it
entirely composed of Miss Schlegels.&#160; But the world being what
it is, perhaps they shine out in it like stars.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A word on their origin.&#160; They were not
"English to the backbone," as their aunt had piously
asserted.&#160; But, on the other band, they were not "Germans of
the dreadful sort." Their father had belonged to a type that was
more prominent in Germany fifty years ago than now.&#160; He was
not the aggressive German, so dear to the English journalist, nor
the domestic German, so dear to the English wit.&#160; If one
classed him at all it would be as the countryman of Hegel and Kant,
as the idealist, inclined to be dreamy, whose Imperialism was the
Imperialism of the air.&#160; Not that his life had been
inactive.&#160; He had fought like blazes against Denmark, Austria,
France.&#160; But he had fought without visualizing the results of
victory.&#160; A hint of the truth broke on him after Sedan, when
he saw the dyed moustaches of Napoleon going grey; another when he
entered Paris, and saw the smashed windows of the Tuileries.&#160;
Peace came--it was all very immense, one had turned into an
Empire--but he knew that some quality had vanished for which not
all Alsace-Lorraine could compensate him.&#160; Germany a
commercial Power, Germany a naval Power, Germany with colonies here
and a Forward Policy there, and legitimate aspirations in the other
place, might appeal to others, and be fitly served by them; for his
own part, he abstained from the fruits of victory, and naturalized
himself in England.&#160; The more earnest members of his family
never forgave him, and knew that his children, though scarcely
English of the dreadful sort, would never be German to the
backbone.&#160; He had obtained work in one of our provincial
Universities, and there married Poor Emily (or Die Engl&#228;nderin
as the case may be), and as she had money, they proceeded to
London, and came to know a good many people.&#160; But his gaze was
always fixed beyond the sea.&#160; It was his hope that the clouds
of materialism obscuring the Fatherland would part in time, and the
mild intellectual light re-emerge.&#160; "Do you imply that we
Germans are stupid, Uncle Ernst?" exclaimed a haughty and
magnificent nephew.&#160; Uncle Ernst replied, "To my mind.&#160;
You use the intellect, but you no longer care about it.&#160; That
I call stupidity."&#160; As the haughty nephew did not follow, he
continued, "You only care about the' things that you can use, and
therefore arrange them in the following order: Money, supremely
useful; intellect, rather useful; imagination, of no use at
all.&#160; No"--for the other had protested--"your Pan-Germanism is
no more imaginative than is our Imperialism over here.&#160; It is
the vice of a vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness, to think that
a thousand square miles are a thousand times more wonderful than
one square mile, and that a million square miles are almost the
same as heaven.&#160; That is not imagination.&#160; No, it kills
it.&#160; When their poets over here try to celebrate bigness they
are dead at once, and naturally.&#160; Your poets too are dying,
your philosophers, your musicians, to whom Europe has listened for
two hundred years.&#160; Gone.&#160; Gone with the little courts
that nurtured them--gone with Esterhaz and Weimar.&#160;
What?&#160; What's that?&#160; Your Universities?&#160; Oh, yes,
you have learned men, who collect more facts than do the learned
men of England.&#160; They collect facts, and facts, and empires of
facts.&#160; But which of them will rekindle the light
within?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To all this Margaret listened, sitting on
the haughty nephew's knee.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was a unique education for the little
girls.&#160; The haughty nephew would be at Wickham Place one day,
bringing with him an even haughtier wife, both convinced that
Germany was appointed by God to govern the world.&#160; Aunt Juley
would come the next day, convinced that Great Britain had been
appointed to the same post by the same authority.&#160; Were both
these loud-voiced parties right?&#160; On one occasion they had
met, and Margaret with clasped hands had implored them to argue the
subject out in her presence.&#160; Whereat they blushed, and began
to talk about the weather.&#160; "Papa" she cried--she was a most
offensive child--"why will they not discuss this most clear
question?"&#160; Her father, surveying the parties grimly, replied
that he did not know.&#160; Putting her head on one side, Margaret
then remarked, "To me one of two things is very clear; either God
does not know his own mind about England and Germany, or else these
do not know the mind of God." A hateful little girl, but at
thirteen she had grasped a dilemma that most people travel through
life without perceiving.&#160; Her brain darted up and down; it
grew pliant and strong.&#160; Her conclusion was, that any human
being lies nearer to the unseen than any organization, and from
this she never varied.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen advanced along the same lines, though
with a more irresponsible tread.&#160; In character she resembled
her sister, but she was pretty, and so apt to have a more amusing
time.&#160; People gathered round her more readily, especially when
they were new acquaintances, and she did enjoy a little homage very
much.&#160; When their father died and they ruled alone at Wickham
Place, she often absorbed the whole of the company, while
Margaret--both were tremendous talkers--fell flat.&#160; Neither
sister bothered about this.&#160; Helen never apologized
afterwards, Margaret did not feel the slightest rancour.&#160; But
looks have their influence upon character.&#160; The sisters were
alike as little girls, but at the time of the Wilcox episode their
methods were beginning to diverge; the younger was rather apt to
entice people, and, in enticing them, to be herself enticed; the
elder went straight ahead, and accepted an occasional failure as
part of the game.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Little need be premised about Tibby.&#160;
He was now an intelligent man of sixteen, but dyspeptic and
difficile.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 5</h3>
<p>It will be generally admitted that Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is
the most sublime noise that has ever penetrated into the ear of
man.&#160; All sorts and conditions are satisfied by it.&#160;
Whether you are like Mrs. Munt, and tap surreptitiously when the
tunes come--of course, not so as to disturb the others--; or like
Helen, who can see heroes and shipwrecks in the music's flood; or
like Margaret, who can only see the music; or like Tibby, who is
profoundly versed in counterpoint, and holds the full score open on
his knee; or like their cousin, Fr&#228;ulein Mosebach, who
remembers all the time that Beethoven is "echt Deutsch"; or like
Fr&#228;ulein Mosebach's young man, who can remember nothing but
Fr&#228;ulein Mosebach: in any case, the passion of your life
becomes more vivid, and you are bound to admit that such a noise is
cheap at two shillings.&#160; It is cheap, even if you hear it in
the Queen's Hall, dreariest music-room in London, though not as
dreary as the Free Trade Hall, Manchester; and even if you sit on
the extreme left of that hall, so that the brass bumps at you
before the rest of the orchestra arrives, it is still cheap.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Who is Margaret talking to?" said Mrs.
Munt, at the conclusion of the first movement.&#160; She was again
in London on a visit to Wickham Place.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen looked down the long line of their
party, and said that she did not know.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Would it be some young man or other whom
she takes an interest in?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I expect so," Helen replied.&#160; Music
enwrapped her, and she could not enter into the distinction that
divides young men whom one takes an interest in from young men whom
one knows.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You girls are so wonderful in always
having--Oh dear!&#160; one mustn't talk."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the Andante had begun--very beautiful,
but bearing a family likeness to all the other beautiful Andantes
that Beethoven had written, and, to Helen's mind, rather
disconnecting the heroes and shipwrecks of the first movement from
the heroes and goblins of the third.&#160; She heard the tune
through once, and then her attention wandered, and she gazed at the
audience, or the organ, or the architecture.&#160; Much did she
censure the attenuated Cupids who encircle the ceiling of the
Queen's Hall, inclining each to each with vapid gesture, and clad
in sallow pantaloons, on which the October sunlight struck.&#160;
"How awful to marry a man like those Cupids!" thought Helen.&#160;
Here Beethoven started decorating his tune, so she heard him
through once more, and then she smiled at her cousin Frieda.&#160;
But Frieda, listening to Classical Music, could not respond.&#160;
Herr Liesecke, too, looked as if wild horses could not make him
inattentive; there were lines across his forehead, his lips were
parted, his pince-nez at right angles to his nose, and he had laid
a thick, white hand on either knee.&#160; And next to her was Aunt
Juley, so British, and wanting to tap.&#160; How interesting that
row of people was!&#160; What diverse influences had gone to the
making!&#160; Here Beethoven, after humming and hawing with great
sweetness, said "Heigho," and the Andante came to an end.&#160;
Applause, and a round of "wundersch&#246;ning" and
"prachtvolleying" from the German contingent.&#160; Margaret
started talking to her new young man; Helen said to her aunt: "Now
comes the wonderful movement: first of all the goblins, and then a
trio of elephants dancing;" and Tibby implored the company
generally to look out for the transitional passage on the
drum.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"On the what, dear?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"On the <em>drum</em>, Aunt Juley."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No; look out for the part where you think
you have done with the goblins and they come back," breathed Helen,
as the music started with a goblin walking quietly over the
universe, from end to end.&#160; Others followed him.&#160; They
were not aggressive creatures; it was that that made them so
terrible to Helen.&#160; They merely observed in passing that there
was no such thing as splendour or heroism in the world.&#160; After
the interlude of elephants dancing, they returned and made the
observation for the second time.&#160; Helen could not contradict
them, for, once at all events, she had felt the same, and had seen
the reliable walls of youth collapse.&#160; Panic and
emptiness!&#160; Panic and emptiness!&#160; The goblins were
right.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Her brother raised his finger: it was the
transitional passage on the drum.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For, as if things were going too far,
Beethoven took hold of the goblins and made them do what he
wanted.&#160; He appeared in person.&#160; He gave them a little
push, and they began to walk in major key instead of in a minor,
and then--he blew with his mouth and they were scattered!&#160;
Gusts of splendour, gods and demigods contending with vast swords,
colour and fragrance broadcast on the field of battle, magnificent
victory, magnificent death!&#160; Oh, it all burst before the girl,
and she even stretched out her gloved hands as if it was
tangible.&#160; Any fate was titanic; any contest desirable;
conqueror and conquered would alike be applauded by the angels of
the utmost stars.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And the goblins--they had not really been
there at all?&#160; They were only the phantoms of cowardice and
unbelief?&#160; One healthy human impulse would dispel them?&#160;
Men like the Wilcoxes, or President Roosevelt, would say yes.&#160;
Beethoven knew better.&#160; The goblins really had been
there.&#160; They might return--and they did.&#160; It was as if
the splendour of life might boil over--and waste to steam and
froth.&#160; In its dissolution one heard the terrible, ominous
note, and a goblin, with increased malignity, walked quietly over
the universe from end to end.&#160; Panic and emptiness!&#160;
Panic and emptiness!&#160; Even the flaming ramparts of the world
might fall.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Beethoven chose to make all right in the
end.&#160; He built the ramparts up. He blew with his mouth for the
second time, and again the goblins were scattered.&#160; He brought
back the gusts of splendour, the heroism, the youth, the
magnificence of life and of death, and, amid vast roarings of a
superhuman joy, he led his Fifth Symphony to its conclusion.&#160;
But the goblins were there.&#160; They could return.&#160; He had
said so bravely, and that is why one can trust Beethoven when he
says other things.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen pushed her way out during the
applause.&#160; She desired to be alone.&#160; The music summed up
to her all that had happened or could happen in her career.&#160;
She read it as a tangible statement, which could never be
superseded.&#160; The notes meant this and that to her, and they
could have no other meaning, and life could have no other
meaning.&#160; She pushed right out of the building, and walked
slowly down the outside staircase, breathing the autumnal air, and
then she strolled home.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Margaret," called Mrs. Munt, "is Helen all
right?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh yes."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She is always going away in the middle of
a programme," said Tibby.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The music has evidently moved her deeply,"
said Fr&#228;ulein Mosebach.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Excuse me," said Margaret's young man, who
had for some time been preparing a sentence, "but that lady has,
quite inadvertently, taken my umbrella."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, good gracious me!&#160;--I am so
sorry.&#160; Tibby, run after Helen."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I shall miss the Four Serious Songs if I
do."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Tibby love, you must go."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It isn't of any consequence," said the
young man, in truth a little uneasy about his umbrella.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But of course it is.&#160; Tibby!&#160;
Tibby!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tibby rose to his feet, and wilfully caught
his person on the backs of the chairs.&#160; By the time he had
tipped up the seat and had found his hat, and had deposited his
full score in safety, it was "too late" to go after Helen.&#160;
The Four Serious Songs had begun, and one could not move during
their performance.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"My sister is so careless," whispered
Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not at all," replied the young man; but
his voice was dead and cold.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If you would give me your address--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, not at all, not at all;" and he
wrapped his greatcoat over his knees.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then the Four Serious Songs rang shallow in
Margaret's ears.&#160; Brahms, for all his grumbling and grizzling,
had never guessed what it felt like to be suspected of stealing an
umbrella.&#160; For this fool of a young man thought that she and
Helen and Tibby had been playing the confidence trick on him, and
that if he gave his address they would break into his rooms some
midnight or other and steal his walkingstick too.&#160; Most ladies
would have laughed, but Margaret really minded, for it gave her a
glimpse into squalor.&#160; To trust people is a luxury in which
only the wealthy can indulge; the poor cannot afford it.&#160; As
soon as Brahms had grunted himself out, she gave him her card and
said, "That is where we live; if you preferred, you could call for
the umbrella after the concert, but I didn't like to trouble you
when it has all been our fault."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His face brightened a little when he saw
that Wickham Place was W. It was sad to see him corroded with
suspicion, and yet not daring to be impolite, in case these
well-dressed people were honest after all.&#160; She took it as a
good sign that he said to her, "It's a fine programme this
afternoon, is it not?" for this was the remark with which he had
originally opened, before the umbrella intervened.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The Beethoven's fine," said Margaret, who
was not a female of the encouraging type.&#160; "I don't like the
Brahms, though, nor the Mendelssohn that came first--and ugh!&#160;
I don't like this Elgar that's coming."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What, what?" called Herr Liesecke,
overhearing.&#160; "The <em>Pomp and Circumstance</em> will not be
fine?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, Margaret, you tiresome girl!" cried
her aunt.&#160; "Here have I been persuading Herr Liesecke to stop
for <em>Pomp and Circumstance</em>, and you are undoing all my
work.&#160; I am so anxious for him to hear what we are doing in
music.&#160; Oh, you mustn't run down our English composers,
Margaret."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"For my part, I have heard the composition
at Stettin," said Fr&#228;ulein Mosebach.&#160; "On two
occasions.&#160; It is dramatic, a little."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Frieda, you despise English music.&#160;
You know you do.&#160; And English art.&#160; And English
Literature, except Shakespeare and he's a German.&#160; Very well,
Frieda, you may go."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The lovers laughed and glanced at each
other.&#160; Moved by a common impulse, they rose to their feet and
fled from <em>Pomp and Circumstance</em>.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We have this call to play in Finsbury
Circus, it is true," said Herr Liesecke, as he edged past her and
reached the gangway just as the music started.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Margaret--" loudly whispered by Aunt
Juley.&#160; "Margaret, Margaret!&#160; Fr&#228;ulein Mosebach has
left her beautiful little bag behind her on the seat."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sure enough, there was Frieda's reticule,
containing her address book, her pocket dictionary, her map of
London, and her money.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, what a bother--what a family we
are!&#160; Fr-Frieda!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Hush!" said all those who thought the
music fine.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But it's the number they want in Finsbury
Circus--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Might I--couldn't I--" said the suspicious
young man, and got very red.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, I would be so grateful."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He took the bag--money clinking inside
it--and slipped up the gangway with it.&#160; He was just in time
to catch them at the swing-door, and he received a pretty smile
from the German girl and a fine bow from her cavalier.&#160; He
returned to his seat up-sides with the world.&#160; The trust that
they had reposed in him was trivial, but he felt that it cancelled
his mistrust for them, and that probably he would not be "had" over
his umbrella.&#160; This young man had been "had" in the
past--badly, perhaps overwhelmingly--and now most of his energies
went in defending himself against the unknown.&#160; But this
afternoon--perhaps on account of music--he perceived that one must
slack off occasionally, or what is the good of being alive?&#160;
Wickham Place, W., though a risk, was as safe as most things, and
he would risk it.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So when the concert was over and Margaret
said, "We live quite near; I am going there now.&#160; Could you
walk around with me, and we'll find your umbrella?" he said, "Thank
you," peaceably, and followed her out of the Queen's Hall.&#160;
She wished that he was not so anxious to hand a lady downstairs, or
to carry a lady's programme for her--his class was near enough her
own for its manners to vex her.&#160; But she found him interesting
on the whole--every one interested the Schlegels on the whole at
that time--and while her lips talked culture, her heart was
planning to invite him to tea.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How tired one gets after music!" she
began.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do you find the atmosphere of Queen's Hall
oppressive?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, horribly."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But surely the atmosphere of Covent Garden
is even more oppressive."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do you go there much?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"When my work permits, I attend the gallery
for, the Royal Opera."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen would have exclaimed, "So do I. I
love the gallery," and thus have endeared herself to the young
man.&#160; Helen could do these things.&#160; But Margaret had an
almost morbid horror of "drawing people out," of "making things
go." She had been to the gallery at Covent Garden, but she did not
"attend" it, preferring the more expensive seats; still less did
she love it.&#160; So she made no reply.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"This year I have been three times--to
<em>Faust</em>, <em>Tosca</em>, and--" Was it "Tannhouser" or
"Tannhoyser"?&#160; Better not risk the word.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret disliked <em>Tosca</em> and
<em>Faust</em>.&#160; And so, for one reason and another, they
walked on in silence, chaperoned by the voice of Mrs. Munt, who was
getting into difficulties with her nephew.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I do in a <em>way</em> remember the
passage, Tibby, but when every instrument is so beautiful, it is
difficult to pick out one thing rather than another.&#160; I am
sure that you and Helen take me to the very nicest concerts.&#160;
Not a dull note from beginning to end.&#160; I only wish that our
German friends would have stayed till it finished."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But surely you haven't forgotten the drum
steadily beating on the low C, Aunt Juley?" came Tibby's
voice.&#160; "No one could.&#160; It's unmistakable."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"A specially loud part?" hazarded Mrs.
Munt.&#160; "Of course I do not go in for being musical," she
added, the shot failing.&#160; "I only care for music--a very
different thing.&#160; But still I will say this for myself--I do
know when I like a thing and when I don't.&#160; Some people are
the same about pictures.&#160; They can go into a picture
gallery--Miss Conder can--and say straight off what they feel, all
round the wall.&#160; I never could do that.&#160; But music is so
different to pictures, to my mind.&#160; When it comes to music I
am as safe as houses, and I assure you, Tibby, I am by no means
pleased by everything.&#160; There was a thing--something about a
faun in French--which Helen went into ecstasies over, but I thought
it most tinkling and superficial, and said so, and I held to my
opinion too."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do you agree?" asked Margaret.&#160; "Do
you think music is so different to pictures?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I--I should have thought so, kind of," he
said.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So should I. Now, my sister declares
they're just the same.&#160; We have great arguments over it.&#160;
She says I'm dense; I say she's sloppy." Getting under way, she
cried: "Now, doesn't it seem absurd to you?&#160; What is the good
of the Arts if they are interchangeable?&#160; What is the good of
the ear if it tells you the same as the eye?&#160; Helen's one aim
is to translate tunes into the language of painting, and pictures
into the language of music.&#160; It's very ingenious, and she says
several pretty things in the process, but what's gained, I'd like
to know?&#160; Oh, it's all rubbish, radically false.&#160; If
Monet's really Debussy, and Debussy's really Monet, neither
gentleman is worth his salt--that's my opinion.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Evidently these sisters quarrelled.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Now, this very symphony that we've just
been having--she won't let it alone.&#160; She labels it with
meanings from start to finish; turns it into literature.&#160; I
wonder if the day will ever return when music will be treated as
music.&#160; Yet I don't know.&#160; There's my brother--behind
us.&#160; He treats music as music, and oh, my goodness!&#160; He
makes me angrier than anyone, simply furious.&#160; With him I
daren't even argue."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An unhappy family, if talented.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But, of course, the real villain is
Wagner.&#160; He has done more than any man in the nineteenth
century towards the muddling of arts.&#160; I do feel that music is
in a very serious state just now, though extraordinarily
interesting.&#160; Every now and then in history there do come
these terrible geniuses, like Wagner, who stir up all the wells of
thought at once.&#160; For a moment it's splendid.&#160; Such a
splash as never was.&#160; But afterwards--such a lot of mud; and
the wells--as it were, they communicate with each other too easily
now, and not one of them will run quite clear.&#160; That's what
Wagner's done."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Her speeches fluttered away from the young
man like birds.&#160; If only he could talk like this, he would
have caught the world.&#160; Oh to acquire culture!&#160; Oh, to
pronounce foreign names correctly!&#160; Oh, to be well informed,
discoursing at ease on every subject that a lady started!&#160; But
it would take one years.&#160; With an hour at lunch and a few
shattered hours in the evening, how was it possible to catch up
with leisured women, who had been reading steadily from
childhood?&#160; His brain might be full of names, he might have
even heard of Monet and Debussy; the trouble was that he could not
string them together into a sentence, he could not make them
"tell," he could not quite forget about his stolen umbrella.&#160;
Yes, the umbrella was the real trouble.&#160; Behind Monet and
Debussy the umbrella persisted, with the steady beat of a
drum.&#160; "I suppose my umbrella will be all right," he was
thinking.&#160; "I don't really mind about it.&#160; I will think
about music instead.&#160; I suppose my umbrella will be all
right." Earlier in the afternoon he had worried about seats.&#160;
Ought he to have paid as much as two shillings?&#160; Earlier still
he had wondered, "Shall I try to do without a programme?"&#160;
There had always been something to worry him ever since he could
remember, always something that distracted him in the pursuit of
beauty.&#160; For he did pursue beauty, and therefore, Margaret's
speeches did flutter away from him like birds.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret talked ahead, occasionally saying,
"Don't you think so?&#160; don't you feel the same?"&#160; And once
she stopped, and said "Oh, do interrupt me!" which terrified
him.&#160; She did not attract him, though she filled him with
awe.&#160; Her figure was meagre, her face seemed all teeth and
eyes, her references to her sister and brother were
uncharitable.&#160; For all her cleverness and culture, she was
probably one of those soulless, atheistical women who have been so
shown up by Miss Corelli.&#160; It was surprising (and alarming)
that she should suddenly say, "I do hope that you'll come in and
have some tea."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I do hope that you'll come in and have
some tea.&#160; We should be so glad.&#160; I have dragged you so
far out of your way."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They had arrived at Wickham Place.&#160;
The sun had set, and the backwater, in deep shadow, was filling
with a gentle haze.&#160; To the right of the fantastic skyline of
the flats towered black against the hues of evening; to the left
the older houses raised a square-cut, irregular parapet against the
grey.&#160; Margaret fumbled for her latchkey.&#160; Of course she
had forgotten it.&#160; So, grasping her umbrella by its ferrule,
she leant over the area and tapped at the dining-room window.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Helen!&#160; Let us in!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"All right," said a voice.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You've been taking this gentleman's
umbrella."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Taken a what?" said Helen, opening the
door.&#160; "Oh, what's that?&#160; Do come in!&#160; How do you
do?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Helen, you must not be so
ramshackly.&#160; You took this gentleman's umbrella away from
Queen's Hall, and he has had the trouble of coming for it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, I am so sorry!" cried Helen, all her
hair flying.&#160; She had pulled off her hat as soon as she
returned, and had flung herself into the big dining-room
chair.&#160; "I do nothing but steal umbrellas.&#160; I am so very
sorry!&#160; Do come in and choose one.&#160; Is yours a hooky or a
nobbly?&#160; Mine's a nobbly--at least, I <em>think</em> it
is."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The light was turned on, and they began to
search the hall, Helen, who had abruptly parted with the Fifth
Symphony, commenting with shrill little cries.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Don't you talk, Meg!&#160; You stole an
old gentleman's silk top-hat.&#160; Yes, she did, Aunt Juley.&#160;
It is a positive fact.&#160; She thought it was a muff.&#160; Oh,
heavens!&#160; I've knocked the In and Out card down.&#160; Where's
Frieda?&#160; Tibby, why don't you ever--No, I can't remember what
I was going to say.&#160; That wasn't it, but do tell the maids to
hurry tea up.&#160; What about this umbrella?"&#160; She opened
it.&#160; "No, it's all gone along the seams.&#160; It's an
appalling umbrella.&#160; It must be mine."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But it was not.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He took it from her, murmured a few words
of thanks, and then fled, with the lilting step of the clerk.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But if you will stop--" cried
Margaret.&#160; "Now, Helen, how stupid you've been!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Whatever have I done?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Don't you see that you've frightened him
away?&#160; I meant him to stop to tea.&#160; You oughtn't to talk
about stealing or holes in an umbrella.&#160; I saw his nice eyes
getting so miserable.&#160; No, it's not a bit of good now." For
Helen had darted out into the street, shouting, "Oh, do
stop!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I dare say it is all for the best," opined
Mrs. Munt.&#160; "We know nothing about the young man, Margaret,
and your drawing-room is full of very tempting little
things."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Helen cried: "Aunt Juley, how can
you!&#160; You make me more and more ashamed.&#160; I'd rather he
<em>had</em> been a thief and taken all the apostle spoons than
that I--Well, I must shut the front-door, I suppose.&#160; One more
failure for Helen."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, I think the apostle spoons could have
gone as rent," said Margaret.&#160; Seeing that her aunt did not
understand, she added: "You remember 'rent.' It was one of father's
words--Rent to the ideal, to his own faith in human nature.&#160;
You remember how he would trust strangers, and if they fooled him
he would say, 'It's better to be fooled than to be
suspicious'--that the confidence trick is the work of man, but the
want-of-confidence-trick is the work of the devil."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I remember something of the sort now,"
said Mrs. Munt, rather tartly, for she longed to add, "It was lucky
that your father married a wife with money." But this was unkind,
and she contented herself with, "Why, he might have stolen the
little Ricketts picture as well."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Better that he had," said Helen
stoutly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, I agree with Aunt Juley," said
Margaret.&#160; "I'd rather mistrust people than lose my little
Ricketts.&#160; There are limits."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Their brother, finding the incident
commonplace, had stolen upstairs to see whether there were scones
for tea.&#160; He warmed the teapot--almost too deftly--rejected
the Orange Pekoe that the parlour-maid had provided, poured in five
spoonfuls of a superior blend, filled up with really boiling water,
and now called to the ladies to be quick or they would lose the
aroma.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"All right, Auntie Tibby," called Helen,
while Margaret, thoughtful again, said: "In a way, I wish we had a
real boy in the house--the kind of boy who cares for men.&#160; It
would make entertaining so much easier."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So do I," said her sister.&#160; "Tibby
only cares for cultured females singing Brahms." And when they
joined him she said rather sharply: "Why didn't you make that young
man welcome, Tibby?&#160; You must do the host a little, you
know.&#160; You ought to have taken his hat and coaxed him into
stopping, instead of letting him be swamped by screaming
women."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tibby sighed, and drew a long strand of
hair over his forehead.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, it's no good looking superior.&#160; I
mean what I say."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Leave Tibby alone!" said Margaret, who
could not bear her brother to be scolded.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Here's the house a regular hen-coop!"
grumbled Helen.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, my dear!" protested Mrs. Munt.&#160;
"How can you say such dreadful things!&#160; The number of men you
get here has always astonished me. If there is any danger it's the
other way round."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, but it's the wrong sort of men, Helen
means."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, I don't," corrected Helen.&#160; "We
get the right sort of man, but the wrong side of him, and I say
that's Tibby's fault.&#160; There ought to be a something about the
house--an--I don't know what."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"A touch of the W.'s, perhaps?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen put out her tongue.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Who are the W.'s?" asked Tibby.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The W.'s are things I and Meg and Aunt
Juley know about and you don't, so there!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I suppose that ours is a female house,"
said Margaret, "and one must just accept it.&#160; No, Aunt Juley,
I don't mean that this house is full of women.&#160; I am trying to
say something much more clever.&#160; I mean that it was
irrevocably feminine, even in father's time.&#160; Now I'm sure you
understand!&#160; Well, I'll give you another example.&#160; It'll
shock you, but I don't care.&#160; Suppose Queen Victoria gave a
dinner-party, and that the guests had been Leighton, Millais,
Swinburne, Rossetti, Meredith, Fitzgerald, etc.&#160; Do you
suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would have been
artistic?&#160; Heavens no!&#160; The very chairs on which they sat
would have seen to that.&#160; So with our house--it must be
feminine, and all we can do is to see that it isn't
effeminate.&#160; Just as another house that I can mention, but I
won't, sounded irrevocably masculine, and all its inmates can do is
to see that it isn't brutal."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That house being the W.'s house, I
presume," said Tibby.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You're not going to be told about the
W.'s, my child," Helen cried, "so don't you think it.&#160; And on
the other hand, I don't the least mind if you find out, so don't
you think you've done anything clever, in either case.&#160; Give
me a cigarette."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You do what you can for the house," said
Margaret.&#160; "The drawing-room reeks of smoke."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If you smoked too, the house might
suddenly turn masculine.&#160; Atmosphere is probably a question of
touch and go.&#160; Even at Queen Victoria's dinner-party--if
something had been just a little different--perhaps if she'd worn a
clinging Liberty tea-gown instead of a magenta satin--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"With an Indian shawl over her
shoulders--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Fastened at the bosom with a
Cairngorm-pin--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bursts of disloyal laughter--you must
remember that they are half German--greeted these suggestions, and
Margaret said pensively, "How inconceivable it would be if the
Royal Family cared about Art."&#160; And the conversation drifted
away and away, and Helen's cigarette turned to a spot in the
darkness, and the great flats opposite were sown with lighted
windows, which vanished and were relit again, and vanished
incessantly.&#160; Beyond them the thoroughfare roared gently--a
tide that could never be quiet, while in the east, invisible behind
the smokes of Wapping, the moon was rising.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That reminds me, Margaret.&#160; We might
have taken that young man into the dining-room, at all
events.&#160; Only the majolica plate--and that is so firmly set in
the wall.&#160; I am really distressed that he had no tea."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For that little incident had impressed the
three women more than might be supposed.&#160; It remained as a
goblin football, as a hint that all is not for the best in the best
of all possible worlds, and that beneath these superstructures of
wealth and art there wanders an ill-fed boy, who has recovered his
umbrella indeed, but who has left no address behind him, and no
name.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 6</h3>
<p>We are not concerned with the very poor.&#160; They are
unthinkable, and only to be approached by the statistician or the
poet.&#160; This story deals with gentlefolk, or with those who are
obliged to pretend that they are gentlefolk.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The boy, Leonard Bast, stood at the extreme
verge of gentility.&#160; He was not in the abyss, but he could see
it, and at times people whom he knew had dropped in, and counted no
more.&#160; He knew that he was poor, and would admit it: he would
have died sooner than confess any inferiority to the rich.&#160;
This may be splendid of him.&#160; But he was inferior to most rich
people, there is not the least doubt of it.&#160; He was not as
courteous as the average rich man, nor as intelligent, nor as
healthy, nor as lovable.&#160; His mind and his body had been alike
underfed, because he was poor, and because he was modern they were
always craving better food.&#160; Had he lived some centuries ago,
in the brightly coloured civilizations of the past, he would have
had a definite status, his rank and his income would have
corresponded.&#160; But in his day the angel of Democracy had
arisen, enshadowing the classes with leathern wings, and
proclaiming, "All men are equal--all men, that is to say, who
possess umbrellas," and so he was obliged to assert gentility, lest
he slipped into the abyss where nothing counts, and the statements
of Democracy are inaudible.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As he walked away from Wickham Place, his
first care was to prove that he was as good as the Miss
Schlegels.&#160; Obscurely wounded in his pride, he tried to wound
them in return.&#160; They were probably not ladies.&#160; Would
real ladies have asked him to tea?&#160; They were certainly
ill-natured and cold.&#160; At each step his feeling of superiority
increased.&#160; Would a real lady have talked about stealing an
umbrella?&#160; Perhaps they were thieves after all, and if he had
gone into the house they could have clapped a chloroformed
handkerchief over his face.&#160; He walked on complacently as far
as the Houses of Parliament.&#160; There an empty stomach asserted
itself, and told him he was a fool.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Evening, Mr. Bast."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Evening, Mr. Dealtry."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Nice evening."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Evening."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Dealtry, a fellow clerk, passed on, and
Leonard stood wondering whether he would take the tram as far as a
penny would take him, or whether he would walk.&#160; He decided to
walk--it is no good giving in, and he had spent money enough at
Queen's Hall--and he walked over Westminster Bridge, in front of
St. Thomas's Hospital, and through the immense tunnel that passes
under the South-Western main line at Vauxhall.&#160; In the tunnel
he paused and listened to the roar of the trains.&#160; A sharp
pain darted through his head, and he was conscious of the exact
form of his eye sockets.&#160; He pushed on for another mile, and
did not slacken speed until he stood at the entrance of a road
called Camelia Road, which was at present his home.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Here he stopped again, and glanced
suspiciously to right and left, like a rabbit that is going to bolt
into its hole.&#160; A block of flats, constructed with extreme
cheapness, towered on either hand.&#160; Farther down the road two
more blocks were being built, and beyond these an old house was
being demolished to accommodate another pair.&#160; It was the kind
of scene that may be observed all over London, whatever the
locality--bricks and mortar rising and falling with the
restlessness of the water in a fountain, as the city receives more
and more men upon her soil.&#160; Camelia Road would soon stand out
like a fortress, and command, for a little, an extensive
view.&#160; Only for a little.&#160; Plans were out for the
erection of flats in Magnolia Road also.&#160; And again a few
years, and all the flats in either road might be pulled down, and
new buildings, of a vastness at present unimaginable, might arise
where they had fallen.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Evening, Mr. Bast."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Evening, Mr. Cunningham."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Very serious thing this decline of the
birth-rate in Manchester."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I beg your pardon?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Very serious thing this decline of the
birth-rate in Manchester," repeated Mr. Cunningham, tapping the
Sunday paper, in which the calamity in question had just been
announced to him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ah, yes," said Leonard, who was not going
to let on that he had not bought a Sunday paper.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If this kind of thing goes on the
population of England will be stationary in 1960."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You don't say so."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I call it a very serious thing, eh?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Good-evening, Mr. Cunningham."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Good-evening, Mr. Bast."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then Leonard entered Block B of the flats,
and turned, not upstairs, but down, into what is known to house
agents as a semi-basement, and to other men as a cellar.&#160; He
opened the door, and cried "Hullo!" with the pseudo-geniality of
the Cockney.&#160; There was no reply.&#160; "Hullo!" he
repeated.&#160; The sitting-room was empty, though the electric
light had been left burning.&#160; A look of relief came over his
face, and he flung himself into the armchair.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The sitting-room contained, besides the
armchair, two other chairs, a piano, a three-legged table, and a
cosy corner.&#160; Of the walls, one was occupied by the window,
the other by a draped mantelshelf bristling with Cupids.&#160;
Opposite the window was the door, and beside the door a bookcase,
while over the piano there extended one of the masterpieces of Maud
Goodman.&#160; It was an amorous and not unpleasant little hole
when the curtains were drawn, and the lights turned on, and the
gas-stove unlit.&#160; But it struck that shallow makeshift note
that is so often heard in the modem dwelling-place.&#160; It had
been too easily gained, and could be relinquished too easily.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Leonard was kicking off his boots he
jarred the three-legged table, and a photograph frame, honourably
poised upon it, slid sideways, fell off into the fireplace, and
smashed.&#160; He swore in a colourless sort of way, and picked the
photograph up.&#160; It represented a young lady called Jacky, and
had been taken at the time when young ladies called Jacky were
often photographed with their mouths open.&#160; Teeth of dazzling
whiteness extended along either of Jacky's jaws, and positively
weighted her head sideways, so large were they and so
numerous.&#160; Take my word for it, that smile was simply
stunning, and it is only you and I who will be fastidious, and
complain that true joy begins in the eyes, and that the eyes of
Jacky did not accord with her smile, but were anxious and
hungry.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leonard tried to pull out the fragments of
glass, and cut his fingers and swore again.&#160; A drop of blood
fell on the frame, another followed, spilling over on to the
exposed photograph.&#160; He swore more vigorously, and dashed to
the kitchen, where he bathed his hands.&#160; The kitchen was the
same size as the sitting room; through it was a bedroom.&#160; This
completed his home.&#160; He was renting the flat furnished: of all
the objects that encumbered it none were his own except the
photograph frame, the Cupids, and the books.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Damn, damn, damnation!" he murmured,
together with such other words as he had learnt from older
men.&#160; Then he raised his hand to his forehead and said, "Oh,
damn it all--" which meant something different.&#160; He pulled
himself together.&#160; He drank a little tea, black and silent,
that still survived upon an upper shelf.&#160; He swallowed some
dusty crumbs of cake.&#160; Then he went back to the sitting-room,
settled himself anew, and began to read a volume of Ruskin.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Seven miles to the north of
Venice--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How perfectly the famous chapter
opens!&#160; How supreme its command of admonition and of
poetry!&#160; The rich man is speaking to us from his
gondola.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Seven miles to the north of Venice the
banks of sand which nearer the city rise little above low-water
mark attain by degrees a higher level, and knit themselves at last
into fields of salt morass, raised here and there into shapeless
mounds, and intercepted by narrow creeks of sea."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leonard was trying to form his style on
Ruskin: he understood him to be the greatest master of English
Prose.&#160; He read forward steadily, occasionally making a few
notes.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Let us consider a little each of these
characters in succession, and first (for of the shafts enough has
been said already), what is very peculiar to this church--its
luminousness."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Was there anything to be learnt from this
fine sentence?&#160; Could he adapt it to the needs of daily
life?&#160; Could he introduce it, with modifications, when he next
wrote a letter to his brother, the lay-reader?&#160; For
example--<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Let us consider a little each of these
characters in succession, and first (for of the absence of
ventilation enough has been said already), what is very peculiar to
this flat--its obscurity.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Something told him that the modifications
would not do; and that something, had he known it, was the spirit
of English Prose.&#160; "My flat is dark as well as stuffy." Those
were the words for him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And the voice in the gondola rolled on,
piping melodiously of Effort and Self-Sacrifice, full of high
purpose, full of beauty, full even of sympathy and the love of men,
yet somehow eluding all that was actual and insistent in Leonard's
life.&#160; For it was the voice of one who had never been dirty or
hungry, and had not guessed successfully what dirt and hunger
are.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leonard listened to it with
reverence.&#160; He felt that he was being done good to, and that
if he kept on with Ruskin, and the Queen's Hall Concerts, and some
pictures by Watts, he would one day push his head out of the grey
waters and see the universe.&#160; He believed in sudden
conversion, a belief which may be right, but which is peculiarly
attractive to a half-baked mind.&#160; It is the bias of much
popular religion: in the domain of business it dominates the Stock
Exchange, and becomes that "bit of luck" by which all successes and
failures are explained.&#160; "If only I had a bit of luck, the
whole thing would come straight. . . .&#160; He's got a most
magnificent place down at Streatham and a 20 h.-p.&#160; Fiat, but
then, mind you, he's had luck. . . . I'm sorry the wife's so late,
but she never has any luck over catching trains." Leonard was
superior to these people; he did believe in effort and in a steady
preparation for the change that he desired.&#160; But of a heritage
that may expand gradually, he had no conception: he hoped to come
to Culture suddenly, much as the Revivalist hopes to come to
Jesus.&#160; Those Miss Schlegels had come to it; they had done the
trick; their hands were upon the ropes, once and for all.&#160; And
meanwhile, his flat was dark, as well as stuffy.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Presently there was a noise on the
staircase.&#160; He shut up Margaret's card in the pages of Ruskin,
and opened the door.&#160; A woman entered, of whom it is simplest
to say that she was not respectable.&#160; Her appearance was
awesome.&#160; She seemed all strings and bell-pulls--ribbons,
chains, bead necklaces that clinked and caught--and a boa of azure
feathers hung round her neck, with the ends uneven.&#160; Her
throat was bare, wound with a double row of pearls, her arms were
bare to the elbows, and might again be detected at the shoulder,
through cheap lace.&#160; Her hat, which was flowery, resembled
those punnets, covered with flannel, which we sowed with mustard
and cress in our childhood, and which germinated here yes, and
there no.&#160; She wore it on the back of her head.&#160; As for
her hair, or rather hairs, they are too complicated to describe,
but one system went down her back, lying in a thick pad there,
while another, created for a lighter destiny, rippled around her
forehead.&#160; The face--the face does not signify.&#160; It was
the face of the photograph, but older, and the teeth were not so
numerous as the photographer had suggested, and certainly not so
white.&#160; Yes, Jacky was past her prime, whatever that prime may
have been.&#160; She was descending quicker than most women into
the colourless years, and the look in her eyes confessed it.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What ho!" said Leonard, greeting that
apparition with much spirit, and helping it off with its boa.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Jacky, in husky tones, replied, "What
ho!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Been out?" he asked.&#160; The question
sounds superfluous, but it cannot have been really, for the lady
answered, "No," adding, "Oh, I am so tired."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You tired?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Eh?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'm tired," said he, hanging the boa
up.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, Len, I am so tired."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I've been to that classical concert I told
you about," said Leonard.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What's that?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I came back as soon as it was over."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Any one been round to our place?" asked
Jacky.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not that I've seen.&#160; I met Mr.
Cunningham outside, and we passed a few remarks."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What, not Mr. Cunnginham?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, you mean Mr. Cunningham."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes.&#160; Mr. Cunningham."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I've been out to tea at a lady
friend's."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Her secret being at last given to the
world, and the name of the lady-friend being even adumbrated, Jacky
made no further experiments in the difficult and tiring art of
conversation.&#160; She never had been a great talker.&#160; Even
in her photographic days she had relied upon her smile and her
figure to attract, and now that she was--</p>
<p align="center"><em>"On the shelf,<br />
On the shelf,<br />
Boys, boys, I'm on the shelf,"</em><br /></p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; she was not likely to find her
tongue.&#160; Occasional bursts of song (of which the above is an
example) still issued from her lips, but the spoken word was
rare.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She sat down on Leonard's knee, and began
to fondle him.&#160; She was now a massive woman of thirty-three,
and her weight hurt him, but he could not very well say
anything.&#160; Then she said, "Is that a book you're reading?" and
he said, "That's a book," and drew it from her unreluctant
grasp.&#160; Margaret's card fell out of it.&#160; It fell face
downwards, and he murmured, "Bookmarker."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Len--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What is it?" he asked, a little wearily,
for she only had one topic of conversation when she sat upon his
knee.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You do love me?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Jacky, you know that I do.&#160; How can
you ask such questions!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But you do love me, Len, don't you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Of course I do."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A pause.&#160; The other remark was still
due.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Len--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well?&#160; What is it?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Len, you will make it all right?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I can't have you ask me that again," said
the boy, flaring up into a sudden passion.&#160; "I've promised to
marry you when I'm of age, and that's enough.&#160; My word's my
word.&#160; I've promised to marry you as soon as ever I'm
twenty-one, and I can't keep on being worried.&#160; I've worries
enough.&#160; It isn't likely I'd throw you over, let alone my
word, when I've spent all this money.&#160; Besides, I'm an
Englishman, and I never go back on my word.&#160; Jacky, do be
reasonable.&#160; Of course I'll marry you.&#160; Only do stop
badgering me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"When's your birthday, Len?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I've told you again and again, the
eleventh of November next.&#160; Now get off my knee a bit; someone
must get supper, I suppose."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Jacky went through to the bedroom, and
began to see to her hat.&#160; This meant blowing at it with short
sharp puffs.&#160; Leonard tidied up the sitting-room, and began to
prepare their evening meal.&#160; He put a penny into the slot of
the gas-meter, and soon the flat was reeking with metallic
fumes.&#160; Somehow he could not recover his temper, and all the
time he was cooking he continued to complain bitterly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It really is too bad when a fellow isn't
trusted.&#160; It makes one feel so wild, when I've pretended to
the people here that you're my wife--all right, you shall be my
wife--and I've bought you the ring to wear, and I've taken this
flat furnished, and it's far more than I can afford, and yet you
aren't content, and I've also not told the truth when I've written
home." He lowered his voice.&#160; "He'd stop it." In a tone of
horror, that was a little luxurious, he repeated: "My brother'd
stop it.&#160; I'm going against the whole world, Jacky.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's what I am, Jacky.&#160; I don't
take any heed of what anyone says.&#160; I just go straight
forward, I do.&#160; That's always been my way.&#160; I'm not one
of your weak knock-kneed chaps.&#160; If a woman's in trouble, I
don't leave her in the lurch.&#160; That's not my street.&#160; No,
thank you.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'll tell you another thing too.&#160; I
care a good deal about improving myself by means of Literature and
Art, and so getting a wider outlook.&#160; For instance, when you
came in I was reading Ruskin's <em>Stones of Venice</em>. I don't
say this to boast, but just to show you the kind of man I am.&#160;
I can tell you, I enjoyed that classical concert this
afternoon."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To all his moods Jacky remained equally
indifferent.&#160; When supper was ready--and not before--she
emerged from the bedroom, saying: "But you do love me, don't
you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They began with a soup square, which
Leonard had just dissolved in some hot water.&#160; It was followed
by the tongue--a freckled cylinder of meat, with a little jelly at
the top, and a great deal of yellow fat at the bottom--ending with
another square dissolved in water (jelly: pineapple), which Leonard
had prepared earlier in the day.&#160; Jacky ate contentedly
enough, occasionally looking at her man with those anxious eyes, to
which nothing else in her appearance corresponded, and which yet
seemed to mirror her soul.&#160; And Leonard managed to convince
his stomach that it was having a nourishing meal.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After supper they smoked cigarettes and
exchanged a few statements.&#160; She observed that her "likeness"
had been broken.&#160; He found occasion to remark, for the second
time, that he had come straight back home after the concert at
Queen's Hall.&#160; Presently she sat upon his knee.&#160; The
inhabitants of Camelia Road tramped to and fro outside the window,
just on a level with their heads, and the family in the flat on the
ground-floor began to sing, "Hark, my soul, it is the Lord."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That tune fairly gives me the hump," said
Leonard.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Jacky followed this, and said that, for her
part, she thought it a lovely tune.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No; I'll play you something lovely.&#160;
Get up, dear, for a minute."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He went to the piano and jingled out a
little Grieg.&#160; He played badly and vulgarly, but the
performance was not without its effect, for Jacky said she thought
she'd be going to bed.&#160; As she receded, a new set of interests
possessed the boy, and he began to think of what had been said
about music by that odd Miss Schlegel--the one that twisted her
face about so when she spoke.&#160; Then the thoughts grew sad and
envious.&#160; There was the girl named Helen, who had pinched his
umbrella, and the German girl who had smiled at him pleasantly, and
Herr someone, and Aunt someone, and the brother--all, all with
their hands on the ropes.&#160; They had all passed up that narrow,
rich staircase at Wickham Place, to some ample room, whither he
could never follow them, not if he read for ten hours a day.&#160;
Oh, it was not good, this continual aspiration.&#160; Some are born
cultured; the rest had better go in for whatever comes easy.&#160;
To see life steadily and to see it whole was not for the likes of
him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From the darkness beyond the kitchen a
voice called, "Len?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You in bed?" he asked, his forehead
twitching.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"M'm."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"All right."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Presently she called him again.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I must clean my boots ready for the
morning," he answered.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Presently she called him again.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I rather want to get this chapter
done."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He closed his ears against her.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What's that?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"All right, Jacky, nothing; I'm reading a
book."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What?" he answered, catching her degraded
deafness.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Presently she called him again.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ruskin had visited Torcello by this time,
and was ordering his gondoliers to take him to Murano.&#160; It
occurred to him, as he glided over the whispering lagoons, that the
power of Nature could not be shortened by the folly, nor her beauty
altogether saddened by the misery, of such as Leonard.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 7</h3>
<p>"Oh, Margaret," cried her aunt next morning, "such a most
unfortunate thing has happened.&#160; I could not get you
alone."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most unfortunate thing was not very
serious.&#160; One of the flats in the ornate block opposite had
been taken furnished by the Wilcox family, "coming up, no doubt, in
the hope of getting into London society." That Mrs. Munt should be
the first to discover the misfortune was not remarkable, for she
was so interested in the flats, that she watched their every
mutation with unwearying care.&#160; In theory she despised
them--they took away that old-world look--they cut off the
sun--flats house a flashy type of person.&#160; But if the truth
had been known, she found her visits to Wickham Place twice as
amusing since Wickham Mansions had arisen, and would in a couple of
days learn more about them than her nieces in a couple of months,
or her nephew in a couple of years.&#160; She would stroll across
and make friends with the porters, and inquire what the rents were,
exclaiming for example: "What!&#160; a hundred and twenty for a
basement?&#160; You'll never get it!"&#160; And they would answer:
"One can but try, madam." The passenger lifts, the provision lifts,
the arrangement for coals (a great temptation for a dishonest
porter), were all familiar matters to her, and perhaps a relief
from the politico-economical-&#230;sthetic atmosphere that reigned
at the Schlegels'.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret received the information calmly,
and did not agree that it would throw a cloud over poor Helen's
life.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, but Helen isn't a girl with no
interests," she explained.&#160; "She has plenty of other things
and other people to think about.&#160; She made a false start with
the Wilcoxes, and she'll be as willing as we are to have nothing
more to do with them."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"For a clever girl, dear, how very oddly
you do talk.&#160; Helen'll <em>have</em> to have something more to
do with them, now that they're all opposite.&#160; She may meet
that Paul in the street.&#160; She cannot very well not bow."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Of course she must bow.&#160; But look
here; let's do the flowers.&#160; I was going to say, the will to
be interested in him has died, and what else matters?&#160; I look
on that disastrous episode (over which you were so kind) as the
killing of a nerve in Helen.&#160; It's dead, and she'll never be
troubled with it again.&#160; The only things that matter are the
things that interest one.&#160; Bowing, even calling and leaving
cards, even a dinner-party--we can do all those things to the
Wilcoxes, if they find it agreeable; but the other thing, the one
important thing--never again.&#160; Don't you see?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Munt did not see, and indeed Margaret
was making a most questionable statement--that any emotion, any
interest once vividly aroused, can wholly die.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I also have the honour to inform you that
the Wilcoxes are bored with us.&#160; I didn't tell you at the
time--it might have made you angry, and you had enough to worry
you--but I wrote a letter to Mrs. W., and apologized for the
trouble that Helen had given them.&#160; She didn't answer
it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How very rude!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I wonder.&#160; Or was it sensible?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, Margaret, most rude."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In either case one can class it as
reassuring."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Munt sighed.&#160; She was going back
to Swanage on the morrow, just as her nieces were wanting her
most.&#160; Other regrets crowded upon her: for instance, how
magnificently she would have cut Charles if she had met him face to
face.&#160; She had already seen him, giving an order to the
porter--and very common he looked in a tall hat.&#160; But
unfortunately his back was turned to her, and though she had cut
his back, she could not regard this as a telling snub.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But you will be careful, won't you?" she
exhorted.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, certainly.&#160; Fiendishly
careful."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And Helen must be careful, too,"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Careful over what?" cried Helen, at that
moment coming into the room with her cousin.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Nothing," said Margaret, seized with a
momentary awkwardness.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Careful over what, Aunt Juley?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Munt assumed a cryptic air.&#160; "It
is only that a certain family, whom we know by name but do not
mention, as you said yourself last night after the concert, have
taken the flat opposite from the Mathesons--where the plants are in
the balcony."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen began some laughing reply, and then
disconcerted them all by blushing.&#160; Mrs. Munt was so
disconcerted that she exclaimed, "What, Helen, you don't mind them
coming, do you?" and deepened the blush to crimson.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Of course I don't mind," said Helen a
little crossly.&#160; "It is that you and Meg are both so absurdly
grave about it, when there's nothing to be grave about at
all."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'm not grave," protested Margaret, a
little cross in her turn.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, you look grave; doesn't she,
Frieda?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't feel grave, that's all I can say;
you're going quite on the wrong tack."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, she does not feel grave," echoed Mrs.
Munt.&#160; "I can bear witness to that.&#160; She
disagrees--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Hark!" interrupted Fr&#228;ulein
Mosebach.&#160; "I hear Bruno entering the hall."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For Herr Liesecke was due at Wickham Place
to call for the two younger girls.&#160; He was not entering the
hall--in fact, he did not enter it for quite five minutes.&#160;
But Frieda detected a delicate situation, and said that she and
Helen had much better wait for Bruno down below, and leave Margaret
and Mrs. Munt to finish arranging the flowers.&#160; Helen
acquiesced.&#160; But, as if to prove that the situation was not
delicate really, she stopped in the doorway and said:<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Did you say the Mathesons' flat, Aunt
Juley?&#160; How wonderful you are!&#160; I never knew that the
woman who laced too tightly's name was Matheson."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Come, Helen," said her cousin.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Go, Helen," said her aunt; and continued
to Margaret almost in the same breath: "Helen cannot deceive me,
She does mind."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, hush!" breathed Margaret.&#160;
"Frieda'll hear you, and she can be so tiresome."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She minds," persisted Mrs. Munt, moving
thoughtfully about the room, and pulling the dead chrysanthemums
out of the vases.&#160; "I knew she'd mind--and I'm sure a girl
ought to!&#160; Such an experience!&#160; Such awful coarse-grained
people!&#160; I know more about them than you do, which you forget,
and if Charles had taken you that motor drive--well, you'd have
reached the house a perfect wreck.&#160; Oh, Margaret, you don't
know what you are in for.&#160; They're all bottled up against the
drawing-room window.&#160; There's Mrs. Wilcox--I've seen
her.&#160; There's Paul.&#160; There's Evie, who is a minx.&#160;
There's Charles--I saw him to start with.&#160; And who would an
elderly man with a moustache and a copper-coloured face be?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Mr. Wilcox, possibly."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I knew it.&#160; And there's Mr.
Wilcox."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's a shame to call his face copper
colour," complained Margaret.&#160; "He has a remarkably good
complexion for a man of his age."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Munt, triumphant elsewhere, could
afford to concede Mr. Wilcox his complexion.&#160; She passed on
from it to the plan of campaign that her nieces should pursue in
the future.&#160; Margaret tried to stop her.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Helen did not take the news quite as I
expected, but the Wilcox nerve is dead in her really, so there's no
need for plans."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's as well to be prepared."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No--it's as well not to be
prepared."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Because--'<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Her thought drew being from the obscure
borderland.&#160; She could not explain in so many words, but she
felt that those who prepare for all the emergencies of life
beforehand may equip themselves at the expense of joy.&#160; It is
necessary to prepare for an examination, or a dinner-party, or a
possible fall in the price of stock: those who attempt human
relations must adopt another method, or fail.&#160; "Because I'd
sooner risk it," was her lame conclusion.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But imagine the evenings," exclaimed her
aunt, pointing to the Mansions with the spout of the
watering-can.&#160; "Turn the electric light on her or there, and
it's almost the same room.&#160; One evening they may forget to
draw their blinds down, and you'll see them; and the next, you
yours, and they'll see you.&#160; Impossible to sit out on the
balconies.&#160; Impossible to water the plants, or even
speak.&#160; Imagine going out of the front-door, and they come out
opposite at the same moment.&#160; And yet you tell me that plans
are unnecessary, and you'd rather risk it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I hope to risk things all my life."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, Margaret, most dangerous."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But after all," she continued with a
smile, "there's never any great risk as long as you have
money."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, shame!&#160; What a shocking
speech!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Money pads the edges of things," said Miss
Schlegel.&#160; "God help those who have none."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But this is something quite new!" said
Mrs. Munt, who collected new ideas as a squirrel collects nuts, and
was especially attracted by those that are portable.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"New for me; sensible people have
acknowledged it for years.&#160; You and I and the Wilcoxes stand
upon money as upon islands.&#160; It is so firm beneath our feet
that we forget its very existence.&#160; It's only when we see
someone near us tottering that we realize all that an independent
income means.&#160; Last night, when we were talking up here round
the fire, I began to think that the very soul of the world is
economic, and that the lowest abyss is not the absence of love, but
the absence of coin."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I call that rather cynical."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So do I. But Helen and I, we ought to
remember, when we are tempted to criticize others, that we are
standing on these islands, and that most of the others, are down
below the surface of the sea.&#160; The poor cannot always reach
those whom they want to love, and they can hardly ever escape from
those whom they love no longer.&#160; We rich can.&#160; Imagine
the tragedy last June, if Helen and Paul Wilcox had been poor
people, and couldn't invoke railways and motor-cars to part
them."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's more like Socialism," said Mrs.
Munt suspiciously.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Call it what you like.&#160; I call it
going through life with one's hand spread open on the table.&#160;
I'm tired of these rich people who pretend to be poor, and think it
shows a nice mind to ignore the piles of money that keep their feet
above the waves.&#160; I stand each year upon six hundred pounds,
and Helen upon the same, and Tibby will stand upon eight, and as
fast as our pounds crumble away into the sea they are renewed--from
the sea, yes, from the sea.&#160; And all our thoughts are the
thoughts of six-hundred-pounders, and all our speeches; and because
we don't want to steal umbrellas ourselves, we forget that below
the sea people do want to steal them, and do steal them sometimes,
and that what's a joke up here is down there reality--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There they go--there goes Fr&#228;ulein
Mosebach.&#160; Really, for a German she does dress
charmingly.&#160; Oh--!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What is it?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Helen was looking up at the Wilcoxes'
flat."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why shouldn't she?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I beg your pardon, I interrupted
you.&#160; What was it you were saying about reality?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I had worked round to myself, as usual,"
answered Margaret in tones that were suddenly preoccupied.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do tell me this, at all events.&#160; Are
you for the rich or for the poor?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Too difficult.&#160; Ask me another.&#160;
Am I for poverty or for riches?&#160; For riches.&#160; Hurrah for
riches!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"For riches!" echoed Mrs. Munt, having, as
it were, at last secured her nut.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes.&#160; For riches.&#160; Money for
ever!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So am I, and so, I am afraid, are most of
my acquaintances at Swanage, but I am surprised that you agree with
us."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Thank you so much, Aunt Juley.&#160; While
I have talked theories, you have done the flowers."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not at all, dear.&#160; I wish you would
let me help you in more important things."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, would you be very kind?&#160; Would
you come round with me to the registry office?&#160; There's a
housemaid who won't say yes but doesn't say no."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On their way thither they too looked up at
the Wilcoxes' flat.&#160; Evie was in the balcony, "staring most
rudely," according to Mrs. Munt.&#160; Oh yes, it was a nuisance,
there was no doubt of it.&#160; Helen was proof against a passing
encounter but--Margaret began to lose confidence.&#160; Might it
reawake the dying nerve if the family were living close against her
eyes?&#160; And Frieda Mosebach was stopping with them for another
fortnight, and Frieda was sharp, abominably sharp, and quite
capable of remarking, "You love one of the young gentlemen
opposite, yes?"&#160; The remark would be untrue, but of the kind
which, if stated often enough, may become true; just as the remark,
"England and Germany are bound to fight," renders war a little more
likely each time that it is made, and is therefore made the more
readily by the gutter press of either nation.&#160; Have the
private emotions also their gutter press?&#160; Margaret thought
so, and feared that good Aunt Juley and Frieda were typical
specimens of it.&#160; They might, by continual chatter, lead Helen
into a repetition of the desires of June.&#160; Into a
repetition--they could not do more; they could not lead her into
lasting love.&#160; They were--she saw it clearly--Journalism; her
father, with all his defects and wrong-headedness, had been
Literature, and had he lived, he would have persuaded his daughter
rightly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The registry office was holding its morning
reception.&#160; A string of carriages filled the street.&#160;
Miss Schlegel waited her turn, and finally had to be content with
an insidious "temporary," being rejected by genuine housemaids on
the ground of her numerous stairs.&#160; Her failure depressed her,
and though she forgot the failure, the depression remained.&#160;
On her way home she again glanced up at the Wilcoxes' flat, and
took the rather matronly step of speaking about the matter to
Helen.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Helen, you must tell me whether this thing
worries you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If what?" said Helen, who was washing her
hands for lunch.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The W.'s coming."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, of course not."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Really?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Really." Then she admitted that she was a
little worried on Mrs. Wilcox's account; she implied that Mrs.
Wilcox might reach backward into deep feelings, and be pained by
things that never touched the other members of that clan.&#160; "I
shan't mind if Paul points at our house and says, 'There lives the
girl who tried to catch me.' But she might."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If even that worries you, we could arrange
something.&#160; There's no reason we should be near people who
displease us or whom we displease, thanks to our money.&#160; We
might even go away for a little."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, I am going away.&#160; Frieda's just
asked me to Stettin, and I shan't be back till after the New
Year.&#160; Will that do?&#160; Or must I fly the country
altogether?&#160; Really, Meg, what has come over you to make such
a fuss?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, I'm getting an old maid, I
suppose.&#160; I thought I minded nothing, but really I--I should
be bored if you fell in love with the same man twice and"--she
cleared her throat--"you did go red, you know, when Aunt Juley
attacked you this morning.&#160; I shouldn't have referred to it
otherwise."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Helen's laugh rang true, as she raised
a soapy hand to heaven and swore that never, nowhere and nohow,
would she again fall in love with any of the Wilcox family, down to
its remotest collaterals.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 8</h3>
<p>The friendship between Margaret and Mrs. Wilcox, which was to
develop so--quickly and with such strange results, may perhaps have
had its beginnings at Speyer, in the spring.&#160; Perhaps the
elder lady, as she gazed at the vulgar, ruddy cathedral, and
listened to the talk of Helen and her husband, may have detected in
the other and less charming of the sisters a deeper sympathy, a
sounder judgment.&#160; She was capable of detecting such
things.&#160; Perhaps it was she who had desired the Miss Schlegels
to be invited to Howards End, and Margaret whose presence she had
particularly desired.&#160; All this is speculation: Mrs. Wilcox
has left few clear indications behind her.&#160; It is certain that
she came to call at Wickham Place a fortnight later, the very day
that Helen was going with her cousin to Stettin.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Helen!" cried Fr&#228;ulein Mosebach in
awestruck tones (she was now in her cousin's confidence)--"his
mother has forgiven you!"&#160; And then, remembering that in
England the new-comer ought not to call before she is called upon,
she changed her tone from awe to disapproval, and opined that Mrs.
Wilcox was "keine Dame."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Bother the whole family!" snapped
Margaret.&#160; "Helen, stop giggling and pirouetting, and go and
finish your packing.&#160; Why can't the woman leave us
alone?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't know what I shall do with Meg,"
Helen retorted, collapsing upon the stairs.&#160; "She's got Wilcox
and Box upon the brain.&#160; Meg, Meg, I don't love the young
gentleman; I don't love the young gentleman, Meg, Meg.&#160; Can a
body speak plainer?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Most certainly her love has died,"
asserted Fr&#228;ulein Mosebach.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Most certainly it has, Frieda, but that
will not prevent me from being bored with the Wilcoxes if I return
the call."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then Helen simulated tears, and
Fr&#228;ulein Mosebach, who thought her extremely amusing, did the
same.&#160; "Oh, boo hoo!&#160; boo hoo hoo!&#160; Meg's going to
return the call, and I can't.&#160; 'Cos why?&#160; 'Cos I'm going
to German-eye."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If you are going to Germany, go and pack;
if you aren't, go and call on the Wilcoxes instead of me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But, Meg, Meg, I don't love the young
gentleman; I don't love the young--0 lud, who's that coming down
the stairs?&#160; I vow 'tis my brother. 0 crimini!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A male--even such a male as Tibby--was
enough to stop the foolery.&#160; The barrier of sex, though
decreasing among the civilized, is still high, and higher on the
side of women.&#160; Helen could tell her sister all, and her
cousin much about Paul; she told her brother nothing.&#160; It was
not prudishness, for she now spoke of "the Wilcox ideal" with
laughter, and even with a growing brutality.&#160; Nor was it
precaution, for Tibby seldom repeated any news that did not concern
himself.&#160; It was rather the feeling that she betrayed a secret
into the camp of men, and that, however trivial it was on this side
of the barrier, it would become important on that.&#160; So she
stopped, or rather began to fool on other subjects, until her
long-suffering relatives drove her upstairs.&#160; Fr&#228;ulein
Mosebach followed her, but lingered to say heavily over the
banisters to Margaret, "It is all right--she does not love the
young man--he has not been worthy of her."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, I know; thanks very much."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I thought I did right to tell you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ever so many thanks."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What's that?" asked Tibby.&#160; No one
told him, and he proceeded into the dining-room, to eat Elvas
plums.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That evening Margaret took decisive
action.&#160; The house was very quiet, and the fog--we are in
November now--pressed against the windows like an excluded
ghost.&#160; Frieda and Helen and all their luggage had gone.&#160;
Tibby, who was not feeling well, lay stretched on a sofa by the
fire.&#160; Margaret sat by him, thinking.&#160; Her mind darted
from impulse to impulse, and finally marshalled them all in
review.&#160; The practical person, who knows what he wants at
once, and generally knows nothing else, will excuse her of
indecision.&#160; But this was the way her mind worked.&#160; And
when she did act, no one could accuse her of indecision then.&#160;
She hit out as lustily as if she had not considered the matter at
all.&#160; The letter that she wrote Mrs. Wilcox glowed with the
native hue of resolution.&#160; The pale cast of thought was with
her a breath rather than a tarnish, a breath that leaves the
colours all the more vivid when it has been wiped away.</p>
<blockquote><strong><em>Dear Mrs. Wilcox,<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I have to write something
discourteous.&#160; It would be better if we did not meet.&#160;
Both my sister and my aunt have given displeasure to your family,
and, in my sister's case, the grounds for displeasure might
recur.&#160; As far as I know, she no longer occupies her thoughts
with your son.&#160; But it would not be fair, either to her or to
you, if they met, and it is therefore right that our acquaintance
which began so pleasantly, should end.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I fear that you will not agree with this;
indeed, I know that you will not, since you have been good enough
to call on us.&#160; It is only an instinct on my part, and no
doubt the instinct is wrong.&#160; My sister would, undoubtedly,
say that it is wrong.&#160; I write without her knowledge, and I
hope that you will not associate her with my
discourtesy.</em></strong><br />
<div align="right"><strong><em>Believe me,<br />
Yours truly,<br />
M. J. Schlegel</em></strong></div>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret sent this letter round by
post.&#160; Next morning she received the following reply by
hand:</p>
<blockquote><strong><em>Dear Miss Schlegel,<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;You should not have written me such a
letter.&#160; I called to tell you that Paul has gone
abroad.</em></strong><br />
<div align="right"><strong><em>Ruth Wilcox</em></strong></div>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret's cheeks burnt.&#160; She could
not finish her breakfast.&#160; She was on fire with shame.&#160;
Helen had told her that the youth was leaving England, but other
things had seemed more important, and she had forgotten.&#160; All
her absurd anxieties fell to the ground, and in their place arose
the certainty that she had been rude to Mrs. Wilcox.&#160; Rudeness
affected Margaret like a bitter taste in the mouth.&#160; It
poisoned life.&#160; At times it is necessary, but woe to those who
employ it without due need.&#160; She flung on a hat and shawl,
just like a poor woman, and plunged into the fog, which still
continued.&#160; Her lips were compressed, the letter remained in
her hand, and in this state she crossed the street, entered the
marble vestibule of the flats, eluded the concierges, and ran up
the stairs till she reached the second-floor.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She sent in her name, and to her surprise
was shown straight into Mrs. Wilcox's bedroom.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, Mrs. Wilcox, I have made the baddest
blunder.&#160; I am more, more ashamed and sorry than I can
say."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Wilcox bowed gravely.&#160; She was
offended, and did not pretend to the contrary.&#160; She was
sitting up in bed, writing letters on an invalid table that spanned
her knees.&#160; A breakfast tray was on another table beside
her.&#160; The light of the fire, the light from the window, and
the light of a candle-lamp, which threw a quivering halo round her
hands, combined to create a strange atmosphere of
dissolution.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I knew he was going to India in November,
but I forgot."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He sailed on the 17th for Nigeria, in
Africa."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I knew--I know.&#160; I have been too
absurd all through.&#160; I am very much ashamed."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Wilcox did not answer.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I am more sorry than I can say, and I hope
that you will forgive me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It doesn't matter, Miss Schlegel.&#160; It
is good of you to have come round so promptly."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It does matter," cried Margaret.&#160; "I
have been rude to you; and my sister is not even at home, so there
was not even that excuse.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Indeed?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She has just gone to Germany."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She gone as well," murmured the
other.&#160; "Yes, certainly, it is quite safe--safe, absolutely,
now."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You've been worrying too!" exclaimed
Margaret, getting more and more excited, and taking a chair without
invitation.&#160; "How perfectly extraordinary!&#160; I can see
that you have.&#160; You felt as I do; Helen mustn't meet him
again."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I did think it best."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Now why?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's a most difficult question," said
Mrs. Wilcox, smiling, and a little losing her expression of
annoyance.&#160; "I think you put it best in your letter--it was an
instinct, which may be wrong."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It wasn't that your son still--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh no; he often--my Paul is very young,
you see."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then what was it?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She repeated: "An instinct which may be
wrong."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In other words, they belong to types that
can fall in love, but couldn't live together.&#160; That's
dreadfully probable.&#160; I'm afraid that in nine cases out of ten
Nature pulls one way and human nature another."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"These are indeed 'other words,'" said Mrs.
Wilcox." I had nothing so coherent in my head.&#160; I was merely
alarmed when I knew that my boy cared for your sister."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ah, I have always been wanting to ask
you.&#160; How did you know?&#160; Helen was so surprised when our
aunt drove up, and you stepped forward and arranged things.&#160;
Did Paul tell you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There is nothing to be gained by
discussing that," said Mrs. Wilcox after a moment's pause.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Mrs. Wilcox, were you very angry with us
last June?&#160; I wrote you a letter and you didn't answer
it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I was certainly against taking Mrs.
Matheson's flat.&#160; I knew it was opposite your house."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But it's all right now?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I think so."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You only think?&#160; You aren't
sure?&#160; I do love these little muddles tidied up?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh yes, I'm sure," said Mrs. Wilcox,
moving with uneasiness beneath the clothes.&#160; "I always sound
uncertain over things.&#160; It is my way of speaking."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's all right, and I'm sure too."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Here the maid came in to remove the
breakfast-tray.&#160; They were interrupted, and when they resumed
conversation it was on more normal lines.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I must say good-bye now--you will be
getting up."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No--please stop a little longer--I am
taking a day in bed.&#160; Now and then I do."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I thought of you as one of the early
risers."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"At Howards End--yes; there is nothing to
get up for in London."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Nothing to get up for?" cried the
scandalized Margaret.&#160; "When there are all the autumn
exhibitions, and Ysaye playing in the afternoon!&#160; Not to
mention people."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The truth is, I am a little tired.&#160;
First came the wedding, and then Paul went off, and, instead of
resting yesterday, I paid a round of calls."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"A wedding?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes; Charles, my elder son, is
married."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Indeed!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We took the flat chiefly on that account,
and also that Paul could get his African outfit.&#160; The flat
belongs to a cousin of my husband's, and she most kindly offered it
to us.&#160; So before the day came we were able to make the
acquaintance of Dolly's people, which we had not yet done."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret asked who Dolly's people
were.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Fussell.&#160; The father is in the Indian
army--retired; the brother is in the army.&#160; The mother is
dead."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So perhaps these were the "chinless
sunburnt men" whom Helen had espied one afternoon through the
window.&#160; Margaret felt mildly interested in the fortunes of
the Wilcox family.&#160; She had acquired the habit on Helen's
account, and it still clung to her.&#160; She asked for more
information about Miss Dolly Fussell that was, and was given it in
even, unemotional tones.&#160; Mrs. Wilcox's voice, though sweet
and compelling, had little range of expression.&#160; It suggested
that pictures, concerts, and people are all of small and equal
value.&#160; Only once had it quickened--when speaking of Howards
End.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Charles and Albert Fussell have known one
another some time.&#160; They belong to the same club, and are both
devoted to golf.&#160; Dolly plays golf too, though I believe not
so well, and they first met in a mixed foursome.&#160; We all like
her, and are very much pleased.&#160; They were married on the
11th, a few days before Paul sailed.&#160; Charles was very anxious
to have his brother as best man, so he made a great point of having
it on the 11th.&#160; The Fussells would have preferred it after
Christmas, but they were very nice about it.&#160; There is Dolly's
photograph--in that double frame."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Are you quite certain that I'm not
interrupting, Mrs. Wilcox?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, quite."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then I will stay.&#160; I'm enjoying
this."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dolly's photograph was now examined.&#160;
It was signed "For dear Mims," which Mrs. Wilcox interpreted as
"the name she and Charles had settled that she should call me."
Dolly looked silly, and had one of those triangular faces that so
often prove attractive to a robust man.&#160; She was very
pretty.&#160; From her Margaret passed to Charles, whose features
prevailed opposite.&#160; She speculated on the forces that had
drawn the two together till God parted them.&#160; She found time
to hope that they would be happy.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"They have gone to Naples for their
honeymoon."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Lucky people!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I can hardly imagine Charles in
Italy."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Doesn't he care for travelling?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He likes travel, but he does see through
foreigners so.&#160; What he enjoys most is a motor tour in
England, and I think that would have carried the day if the weather
had not been so abominable.&#160; His father gave him a car of his
own for a wedding present, which for the present is being stored at
Howards End."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I suppose you have a garage there?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes.&#160; My husband built a little one
only last month, to the west of the house, not far from the
wych-elm, in what used to be the paddock for the pony."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The last words had an indescribable ring
about them.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Where's the pony gone?" asked Margaret
after a pause.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The pony?&#160; Oh, dead, ever so long
ago." "The wych-elm I remember.&#160; Helen spoke of it as a very
splendid tree."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It is the finest wych-elm in
Hertfordshire.&#160; Did your sister tell you about the
teeth?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, it might interest you.&#160; There are
pigs' teeth stuck into the trunk, about four feet from the
ground.&#160; The country people put them in long ago, and they
think that if they chew a piece of the bark, it will cure the
toothache.&#160; The teeth are almost grown over now, and no one
comes to the tree."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I should.&#160; I love folklore and all
festering superstitions."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do you think that the tree really did cure
toothache, if one believed in it?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Of course it did.&#160; It would cure
anything--once."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Certainly I remember cases--you see I
lived at Howards End long, long before Mr. Wilcox knew it.&#160; I
was born there."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The conversation again shifted.&#160; At
the time it seemed little more than aimless chatter.&#160; She was
interested when her hostess explained that Howards End was her own
property.&#160; She was bored when too minute an account was given
of the Fussell family, of the anxieties of Charles concerning
Naples, of the movements of Mr. Wilcox and Evie, who were motoring
in Yorkshire.&#160; Margaret could not bear being bored.&#160; She
grew inattentive, played with the photograph frame, dropped it,
smashed Dolly's glass, apologized, was pardoned, cut her finger
thereon, was pitied, and finally said she must be going--there was
all the housekeeping to do, and she had to interview Tibby's
riding-master.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then the curious note was struck
again.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Good-bye, Miss Schlegel, good-bye.&#160;
Thank you for coming.&#160; You have cheered me up."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'm so glad!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I--I wonder whether you ever think about
yourself.?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I think of nothing else," said Margaret,
blushing, but letting her hand remain in that of the invalid.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I wonder.&#160; I wondered at
Heidelberg."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"<em>I'm</em> sure!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I almost think--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes?" asked Margaret, for there was a long
pause--a pause that was somehow akin to the flicker of the fire,
the quiver of the reading-lamp upon their hands, the white blur
from the window; a pause of shifting and eternal shadows.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I almost think you forget you're a
girl."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret was startled and a little
annoyed.&#160; "I'm twenty-nine," she remarked.&#160; "That not so
wildly girlish."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Wilcox smiled.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What makes you say that?&#160; Do you mean
that I have been gauche and rude?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A shake of the head.&#160; "I only meant
that I am fifty-one, and that to me both of you--Read it all in
some book or other; I cannot put things clearly."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, I've got it--inexperience.&#160; I'm
no better than Helen, you mean, and yet I presume to advise
her."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes.&#160; You have got it.&#160;
Inexperience is the word."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Inexperience," repeated Margaret, in
serious yet buoyant tones.&#160; "Of course, I have everything to
learn--absolutely everything--just as much as Helen.&#160; Life's
very difficult and full of surprises.&#160; At all events, I've got
as far as that.&#160; To be humble and kind, to go straight ahead,
to love people rather than pity them, to remember the
submerged--well, one can't do all these things at once, worse luck,
because they're so contradictory.&#160; It's then that proportion
comes in--to live by proportion.&#160; Don't <em>begin</em> with
proportion.&#160; Only prigs do that.&#160; Let proportion come in
as a last resource, when the better things have failed, and a
deadlock--Gracious me, I've started preaching!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Indeed, you put the difficulties of life
splendidly," said Mrs. Wilcox, withdrawing her hand into the deeper
shadows.&#160; "It is just what I should have liked to say about
them myself."</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 9</h3>
<p>Mrs. Wilcox cannot be accused of giving Margaret much
information about life.&#160; And Margaret, on the other hand, has
made a fair show of modesty, and has pretended to an inexperience
that she certainly did not feel.&#160; She had kept house for over
ten years; she had entertained, almost with distinction; she had
brought up a charming sister, and was bringing up a brother.&#160;
Surely, if experience is attainable, she had attained it.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet the little luncheon-party that she gave
in Mrs. Wilcox's honour was not a success.&#160; The new friend did
not blend with the "one or two delightful people" who had been
asked to meet her, and the atmosphere was one of polite
bewilderment.&#160; Her tastes were simple, her knowledge of
culture slight, and she was not interested in the New English Art
Club, nor in the dividing-line between Journalism and Literature,
which was started as a conversational hare.&#160; The delightful
people darted after it with cries of joy, Margaret leading them,
and not till the meal was half over did they realize that the
principal guest had taken no part in the chase.&#160; There was no
common topic.&#160; Mrs. Wilcox, whose life had been spent in the
service of husband and sons, had little to say to strangers who had
never shared it, and whose age was half her own.&#160; Clever talk
alarmed her, and withered her delicate imaginings; it was the
social; counterpart of a motorcar, all jerks, and she was a wisp of
hay, a flower.&#160; Twice she deplored the weather, twice
criticized the train service on the Great Northern Railway.&#160;
They vigorously assented, and rushed on, and when she inquired
whether there was any news of Helen, her hostess was too much
occupied in placing Rothenstein to answer.&#160; The question was
repeated: "I hope that your sister is safe in Germany by now."
Margaret checked herself and said, "Yes, thank you; I heard on
Tuesday." But the demon of vociferation was in her, and the next
moment she was off again.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Only on Tuesday, for they live right away
at Stettin.&#160; Did you ever know any one living at
Stettin?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Never," said Mrs. Wilcox gravely, while
her neighbour, a young man low down in the Education Office, began
to discuss what people who lived at Stettin ought to look
like.&#160; Was there such a thing as Stettininity?&#160; Margaret
swept on.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"People at Stettin drop things into boats
out of overhanging warehouses.&#160; At least, our cousins do, but
aren't particularly rich.&#160; The town isn't interesting, except
for a clock that rolls its eyes, and the view of the Oder, which
truly is something special.&#160; Oh, Mrs. Wilcox, you would love
the Oder!&#160; The river, or rather rivers--there seem to be
dozens of them--are intense blue, and the plain they run through an
intensest green."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Indeed!&#160; That sounds like a most
beautiful view, Miss Schlegel."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So I say, but Helen, who will muddle
things, says no, it's like music.&#160; The course of the Oder is
to be like music.&#160; It's obliged to remind her of a symphonic
poem.&#160; The part by the landing-stage is in B minor, if I
remember rightly, but lower down things get extremely mixed.&#160;
There is a slodgy theme in several keys at once, meaning mud-banks,
and another for the navigable canal, and the exit into the Baltic
is in C sharp major, pianissimo."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What do the overhanging warehouses make of
that?" asked the man, laughing.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"They make a great deal of it," replied
Margaret, unexpectedly rushing off on a new track.&#160; "I think
it's affectation to compare the Oder to music, and so do you, but
the overhanging warehouses of Stettin take beauty seriously, which
we don't, and the average Englishman doesn't, and despises all who
do.&#160; Now don't say 'Germans have no taste,' or I shall
scream.&#160; They haven't.&#160; But--but--such a tremendous
but!&#160;--they take poetry seriously.&#160; They do take poetry
seriously.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Is anything gained by that?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, yes.&#160; The German is always on
the lookout for beauty.&#160; He may miss it through stupidity, or
misinterpret it, but he is always asking beauty to enter his life,
and I believe that in the end it will come.&#160; At Heidelberg I
met a fat veterinary surgeon whose voice broke with sobs as he
repeated some mawkish poetry.&#160; So easy for me to laugh--I, who
never repeat poetry, good or bad, and cannot remember one fragment
of verse to thrill myself with.&#160; My blood boils--well, I'm
half German, so put it down to patriotism--when I listen to the
tasteful contempt of the average islander for things Teutonic,
whether they're B&#246;cklin or my veterinary surgeon.&#160; 'Oh,
B&#246;cklin,' they say; 'he strains after beauty, he peoples
Nature with gods too consciously.' Of course B&#246;cklin strains,
because he wants something--beauty and all the other intangible
gifts that are floating about the world.&#160; So his landscapes
don't come off, and Leader's do."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I am not sure that I agree.&#160; Do you?"
said he, turning to Mrs. Wilcox.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She replied: "I think Miss Schlegel puts
everything splendidly"; and a chill fell on the conversation.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, Mrs. Wilcox, say something nicer than
that.&#160; It's such a snub to be told you put things
splendidly.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I do not mean it as a snub.&#160; Your
last speech interested me so much.&#160; Generally people do not
seem quite to like Germany.&#160; I have long wanted to hear what
is said on the other side."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The other side?&#160; Then you do
disagree.&#160; Oh, good!&#160; Give us your side."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I have no side.&#160; But my husband"--her
voice softened, the chill increased--"has very little faith in the
Continent, and our children have all taken after him."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"On what grounds?&#160; Do they feel that
the Continent is in bad form?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Wilcox had no idea; she paid little
attention to grounds.&#160; She was not intellectual, nor even
alert, and it was odd that, all the same, she should give the idea
of greatness.&#160; Margaret, zigzagging with her friends over
Thought and Art, was conscious of a personality that transcended
their own and dwarfed their activities.&#160; There was no
bitterness in Mrs. Wilcox; there was not even criticism; she was
lovable, and no ungracious or uncharitable word had passed her
lips.&#160; Yet she and daily life were out of focus: one or the
other must show blurred.&#160; And at lunch she seemed more out of
focus than usual, and nearer the line that divides life from a life
that may be of greater importance.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You will admit, though, that the
Continent--it seems silly to speak of 'the Continent,' but really
it is all more like itself than any part of it is like
England.&#160; England is unique.&#160; Do have another jelly
first.&#160; I was going to say that the Continent, for good or for
evil, is interested in ideas.&#160; Its Literature and Art have
what one might call the kink of the unseen about them, and this
persists even through decadence and affectation.&#160; There is
more liberty of action in England, but for liberty of thought go to
bureaucratic Prussia.&#160; People will there discuss with humility
vital questions that we here think ourselves too good to touch with
tongs."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I do not want to go to Prussian" said Mrs.
Wilcox--"not even to see that interesting view that you were
describing.&#160; And for discussing with humility I am too
old.&#160; We never discuss anything at Howards End."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then you ought to!" said Margaret.&#160;
"Discussion keeps a house alive.&#160; It cannot stand by bricks
and mortar alone."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It cannot stand without them," said Mrs.
Wilcox, unexpectedly catching on to the thought, and rousing, for
the first and last time, a faint hope in the breasts of the
delightful people.&#160; "It cannot stand without them, and I
sometimes think--But I cannot expect your generation to agree, for
even my daughter disagrees with me here."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Never mind us or her.&#160; Do say!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I sometimes think that it is wiser to
leave action and discussion to men."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There was a little silence.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"One admits that the arguments against the
suffrage are extraordinarily strong," said a girl opposite, leaning
forward and crumbling her bread.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Are they?&#160; I never follow any
arguments.&#160; I am only too thankful not to have a vote
myself."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We didn't mean the vote, though, did we?"
supplied Margaret.&#160; "Aren't we differing on something much
wider, Mrs. Wilcox?&#160; Whether women are to remain what they
have been since the dawn of history; or whether, since men have
moved forward so far, they too may move forward a little now.&#160;
I say they may.&#160; I would even admit a biological
change."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't know, I don't know."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I must be getting back to my overhanging
warehouse," said the man.&#160; "They've turned disgracefully
strict.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Wilcox also rose.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, but come upstairs for a little.&#160;
Miss Quested plays.&#160; Do you like MacDowell?&#160; Do you mind
him only having two noises?&#160; If you must really go, I'll see
you out.&#160; Won't you even have coffee?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They left the dining-room, closing the door
behind them, and as Mrs. Wilcox buttoned up her jacket, she said:
"What an interesting life you all lead in London!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, we don't," said Margaret, with a
sudden revulsion.&#160; "We lead the lives of gibbering
monkeys.&#160; Mrs. Wilcox--really--We have something quiet and
stable at the bottom.&#160; We really have.&#160; All my friends
have.&#160; Don't pretend you enjoyed lunch, for you loathed it,
but forgive me by coming again, alone, or by asking me to
you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I am used to young people," said Mrs.
Wilcox, and with each word she spoke the outlines of known things
grew dim.&#160; "I hear a great deal of chatter at home, for we,
like you, entertain a great deal.&#160; With us it is more sport
and politics, but--I enjoyed my lunch very much, Miss Schlegel,
dear, and am not pretending, and only wish I could have joined in
more.&#160; For one thing, I'm not particularly well just
today.&#160; For another, you younger people move so quickly that
it dazes me.&#160; Charles is the same, Dolly the same.&#160; But
we are all in the same boat, old and young.&#160; I never forget
that."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They were silent for a moment.&#160; Then,
with a newborn emotion, they shook hands.&#160; The conversation
ceased suddenly when Margaret re-entered the dining-room: her
friends had been talking over her new friend, and had dismissed her
as uninteresting.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 10</h3>
<p>Several days passed.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Was Mrs. Wilcox one of the unsatisfactory
people--there are many of them--who dangle intimacy and then
withdraw it?&#160; They evoke our interests and affections, and
keep the life of the spirit dawdling round them.&#160; Then they
withdraw.&#160; When physical passion is involved, there is a
definite name for such behaviour--flirting--and if carried far
enough it is punishable by law.&#160; But no law--not public
opinion even--punishes those who coquette with friendship, though
the dull ache that they inflict, the sense of misdirected effort
and exhaustion, may be as intolerable.&#160; Was she one of
these?&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret feared so at first, for, with a
Londoner's impatience, she wanted everything to be settled up
immediately.&#160; She mistrusted the periods of quiet that are
essential to true growth.&#160; Desiring to book Mrs. Wilcox as a
friend, she pressed on the ceremony, pencil, as it were, in hand,
pressing the more because the rest of the family were away, and the
opportunity seemed favourable.&#160; But the elder woman would not
be hurried.&#160; She refused to fit in with the Wickham Place set,
or to reopen discussion of Helen and Paul, whom Margaret would have
utilized as a short-cut.&#160; She took her time, or perhaps let
time take her, and when the crisis did come all was ready.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The crisis opened with a message: would
Miss Schlegel come shopping?&#160; Christmas was nearing, and Mrs.
Wilcox felt behind-hand with the presents.&#160; She had taken some
more days in bed, and must make up for lost time.&#160; Margaret
accepted, and at eleven o'clock one cheerless morning they started
out in a brougham.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"First of all," began Margaret, "we must
make a list and tick off the people's names.&#160; My aunt always
does, and this fog may thicken up any moment.&#160; Have you any
ideas?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I thought we would go to Harrod's or the
Haymarket Stores," said Mrs. Wilcox rather hopelessly.&#160;
"Everything is sure to be there.&#160; I am not a good
shopper.&#160; The din is so confusing, and your aunt is quite
right--one ought to make a list.&#160; Take my notebook, then, and
write your own name at the top of the page."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, hooray!" said Margaret, writing
it.&#160; "How very kind of you to start with me!"&#160; But she
did not want to receive anything expensive.&#160; Their
acquaintance was singular rather than intimate, and she divined
that the Wilcox clan would resent any expenditure on outsiders; the
more compact families do.&#160; She did not want to be thought a
second Helen, who would snatch presents since she could not snatch
young men, nor to be exposed, like a second Aunt Juley, to the
insults of Charles.&#160; A certain austerity of demeanour was
best, and she added: "I don't really want a Yuletide gift,
though.&#160; In fact, I'd rather not."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Because I've odd ideas about
Christmas.&#160; Because I have all that money can buy.&#160; I
want more people, but no more things."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I should like to give you something worth
your acquaintance, Miss Schlegel, in memory of your kindness to me
during my lonely fortnight.&#160; It has so happened that I have
been left alone, and you have stopped me from brooding.&#160; I am
too apt to brood."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If that is so," said Margaret, "if I have
happened to be of use to you, which I didn't know, you cannot pay
me back with anything tangible."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;" I suppose not, but one would like
to.&#160; Perhaps I shall think of something as we go about."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Her name remained at the head of the list,
but nothing was written opposite it.&#160; They drove from shop to
shop.&#160; The air was white, and when they alighted it tasted
like cold pennies.&#160; At times they passed through a clot of
grey.&#160; Mrs. Wilcox's vitality was low that morning, and it was
Margaret who decided on a horse for this little girl, a golliwog
for that, for the rector's wife a copper warming-tray.&#160; "We
always give the servants money." "Yes, do you, yes, much easier,"
replied Margaret, but felt the grotesque impact of the unseen upon
the seen, and saw issuing from a forgotten manger at Bethlehem this
torrent of coins and toys.&#160; Vulgarity reigned.&#160;
Public-houses, besides their usual exhortation against temperance
reform, invited men to "Join our Christmas goose club"--one bottle
of gin, etc., or two, according to subscription.&#160; A poster of
a woman in tights heralded the Christmas pantomime, and little red
devils, who had come in again that year, were prevalent upon the
Christmas-cards.&#160; Margaret was no morbid idealist.&#160; She
did not wish this spate of business and self-advertisement
checked.&#160; It was only the occasion of it that struck her with
amazement annually.&#160; How many of these vacillating shoppers
and tired shop-assistants realized that it was a divine event that
drew them together?&#160; She realized it, though standing outside
in the matter.&#160; She was not a Christian in the accepted sense;
she did not believe that God had ever worked among us as a young
artisan.&#160; These people, or most of them, believed it, and if
pressed, would affirm it in words.&#160; But the visible signs of
their belief were Regent Street or Drury Lane, a little mud
displaced, a little money spent, a little food cooked, eaten, and
forgotten.&#160; Inadequate.&#160; But in public who shall express
the unseen adequately?&#160; It is private life that holds out the
mirror to infinity; personal intercourse, and that alone, that ever
hints at a personality beyond our daily vision.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, I do like Christmas on the whole," she
announced.&#160; "In its clumsy way, it does approach Peace and
Goodwill.&#160; But oh, it is clumsier every year."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Is it?&#160; I am only used to country
Christmases."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We are usually in London, and play the
game with vigour--carols at the Abbey, clumsy midday meal, clumsy
dinner for the maids, followed by Christmas-tree and dancing of
poor children, with songs from Helen.&#160; The drawing-room does
very well for that.&#160; We put the tree in the powder-closet, and
draw a curtain when the candles are lighted, and with the
looking-glass behind it looks quite pretty.&#160; I wish we might
have a powder-closet in our next house.&#160; Of course, the tree
has to be very small, and the presents don't hang on it.&#160; No;
the presents reside in a sort of rocky landscape made of crumpled
brown paper."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You spoke of your 'next house,' Miss
Schlegel.&#160; Then are you leaving Wickham Place?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, in two or three years, when the lease
expires.&#160; We must."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Have you been there long?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"All our lives."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You will be very sorry to leave it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I suppose so.&#160; We scarcely realize it
yet.&#160; My father--" She broke off, for they had reached the
stationery department of the Haymarket Stores, and Mrs. Wilcox
wanted to order some private greeting cards.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If possible, something distinctive," she
sighed.&#160; At the counter she found a friend, bent on the same
errand, and conversed with her insipidly, wasting much time.&#160;
"My husband and our daughter are motoring."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Bertha too?&#160; Oh, fancy, what a
coincidence!"&#160; Margaret, though not practical, could shine in
such company as this.&#160; While they talked, she went through a
volume of specimen cards, and submitted one for Mrs. Wilcox's
inspection.&#160; Mrs. Wilcox was delighted--so original, words so
sweet; she would order a hundred like that, and could never be
sufficiently grateful.&#160; Then, just as the assistant was
booking the order, she said: "Do you know, I'll wait.&#160; On
second thoughts, I'll wait.&#160; There's plenty of time still,
isn't there, and I shall be able to get Evie's opinion."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They returned to the carriage by devious
paths; when they were in, she said, "But couldn't you get it
renewed?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I beg your pardon?" asked Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The lease, I mean."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, the lease!&#160; Have you been
thinking of that all the time?&#160; How very kind of you!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Surely something could be done."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No; values have risen too
enormously.&#160; They mean to pull down Wickham Place, and build
flats like yours."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But how horrible!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Landlords are horrible."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then she said vehemently: "It is monstrous,
Miss Schlegel; it isn't right.&#160; I had no idea that this was
hanging over you.&#160; I do pity you from the bottom of my
heart.&#160; To be parted from your house, your father's house--it
oughtn't to be allowed.&#160; It is worse than dying.&#160; I would
rather die than--Oh, poor girls!&#160; Can what they call
civilization be right, if people mayn't die in the room where they
were born?&#160; My dear, I am so sorry--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret did not know what to say.&#160;
Mrs. Wilcox had been overtired by the shopping, and was inclined to
hysteria.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Howards End was nearly pulled down
once.&#160; It would have killed me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Howards End must be a very different house
to ours.&#160; We are fond of ours, but there is nothing
distinctive about it.&#160; As you saw, it is an ordinary London
house.&#160; We shall easily find another."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So you think."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Again my lack of experience, I suppose!"
said Margaret, easing away from the subject.&#160; "I can't say
anything when you take up that line, Mrs. Wilcox.&#160; I wish I
could see myself as you see me--foreshortened into a
backfisch.&#160; Quite the ing&#233;nue.&#160; Very
charming--wonderfully well read for my age, but incapable--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Wilcox would not be deterred.&#160;
"Come down with me to Howards End now," she said, more vehemently
than ever.&#160; "I want you to see it.&#160; You have never seen
it.&#160; I want to hear what you say about it, for you do put
things so wonderfully."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret glanced at the pitiless air and
then at the tired face of her companion.&#160; "Later on I should
love it," she continued, "but it's hardly the weather for such an
expedition, and we ought to start when we're fresh.&#160; Isn't the
house shut up, too?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She received no answer.&#160; Mrs. Wilcox
appeared to be annoyed.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Might I come some other day?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Wilcox bent forward and tapped the
glass.&#160; "Back to Wickham Place, please!" was her order to the
coachman.&#160; Margaret had been snubbed.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"A thousand thanks, Miss Schlegel, for all
your help."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not at all."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It is such a comfort to get the presents
off my mind--the Christmas-cards especially.&#160; I do admire your
choice."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was her turn to receive no answer.&#160;
In her turn Margaret became annoyed.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"My husband and Evie will be back the day
after tomorrow.&#160; That is why I dragged you out shopping
today.&#160; I stayed in town chiefly to shop, but got through
nothing, and now he writes that they must cut their tour short, the
weather is so bad, and the police-traps have been so bad--nearly as
bad as in Surrey.&#160; Ours is such a careful chauffeur, and my
husband feels it particularly hard that they should be treated like
roadhogs."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, naturally he--he isn't a
road-hog."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He was exceeding the speed-limit, I
conclude.&#160; He must expect to suffer with the lower
animals."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Wilcox was silenced.&#160; In growing
discomfort they drove homewards.&#160; The city seemed Satanic, the
narrower streets oppressing like the galleries of a mine.&#160; No
harm was done by the fog to trade, for it lay high, and the lighted
windows of the shops were thronged with customers.&#160; It was
rather a darkening of the spirit which fell back upon itself, to
find a more grievous darkness within.&#160; Margaret nearly spoke a
dozen times, but something throttled her.&#160; She felt petty and
awkward, and her meditations on Christmas grew more cynical.&#160;
Peace?&#160; It may bring other gifts, but is there a single
Londoner to whom Christmas is peaceful?&#160; The craving for
excitement and for elaboration has ruined that blessing.&#160;
Goodwill?&#160; Had she seen any example of it in the hordes of
purchasers?&#160; Or in herself.&#160; She had failed to respond to
this invitation merely because it was a little queer and
imaginative--she, whose birthright it was to nourish
imagination!&#160; Better to have accepted, to have tired
themselves a little by the journey, than coldly to reply, "Might I
come some other day?"&#160; Her cynicism left her.&#160; There
would be no other day.&#160; This shadowy woman would never ask her
again.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They parted at the Mansions.&#160; Mrs.
Wilcox went in after due civilities, and Margaret watched the tall,
lonely figure sweep up the hall to the lift.&#160; As the glass
doors closed on it she had the sense of an imprisonment.&#160; The
beautiful head disappeared first, still buried in the muff, the
long trailing skirt followed.&#160; A woman of undefinable rarity
was going up heaven-ward, like a specimen in a bottle.&#160; And
into what a heaven--a vault as of hell, sooty black, from which
soots descended!&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At lunch her brother, seeing her inclined
for silence, insisted on talking.&#160; Tibby was not ill-natured,
but from babyhood something drove him to do the unwelcome and the
unexpected.&#160; Now he gave her a long account of the day-school
that he sometimes patronized.&#160; The account was interesting,
and she had often pressed him for it before, but she could not
attend now, for her mind was focussed on the invisible.&#160; She
discerned that Mrs. Wilcox, though a loving wife and mother, had
only one passion in life--her house--and that the moment was solemn
when she invited a friend to share this passion with her.&#160; To
answer "another day" was to answer as a fool.&#160; "Another day"
will do for brick and mortar, but not for the Holy of Holies into
which Howards End had been transfigured.&#160; Her own curiosity
was slight.&#160; She had heard more than enough about it in the
summer.&#160; The nine windows, the vine, and the wych-elm had no
pleasant connections for her, and she would have preferred to spend
the afternoon at a concert.&#160; But imagination triumphed.&#160;
While her brother held forth she determined to go, at whatever
cost, and to compel Mrs. Wilcox to go, too.&#160; When lunch was
over she stepped over to the flats.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Wilcox had just gone away for the
night.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret said that it was of no
consequence, hurried downstairs, and took a hansom to King's
Cross.&#160; She was convinced that the escapade was important,
though it would have puzzled her to say why.&#160; There was a
question of imprisonment and escape, and though she did not know
the time of the train, she strained her eyes for the St. Pancras'
clock.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then the clock of King's Cross swung into
sight, a second moon in that infernal sky, and her cab drew up at
the station.&#160; There was a train for Hilton in five
minutes.&#160; She took a ticket, asking in her agitation for a
single.&#160; As she did so, a grave and happy voice saluted her
and thanked her.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I will come if I still may," said
Margaret, laughing nervously.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You are coming to sleep, dear, too.&#160;
It is in the morning that my house is most beautiful.&#160; You are
coming to stop.&#160; I cannot show you my meadow properly except
at sunrise.&#160; These fogs"--she pointed at the station
roof--"never spread far.&#160; I dare say they are sitting in the
sun in Hertfordshire, and you will never repent joining them.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I shall never repent joining you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It is the same."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They began the walk up the long
platform.&#160; Far at its end stood the train, breasting the
darkness without.&#160; They never reached it.&#160; Before
imagination could triumph, there were cries of "Mother!&#160;
Mother!" and a heavy-browed girl darted out of the cloak-room and
seized Mrs. Wilcox by the arm.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Evie!" she gasped.&#160; "Evie, my
pet--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The girl called, "Father!&#160; I
say!&#160; look who's here."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Evie, dearest girl, why aren't you in
Yorkshire?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No--motor smash--changed plans--Father's
coming."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why, Ruth!" cried Mr. Wilcox, joining
them.&#160; "What in the name of all that's wonderful are you doing
here, Ruth?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Wilcox had recovered herself.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, Henry dear!&#160;--here's a lovely
surprise--but let me introduce--but I think you know Miss
Schlegel."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, yes," he replied, not greatly
interested.&#160; "But how's yourself, Ruth?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Fit as a fiddle," she answered
gaily.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So are we and so was our car, which ran
A-1 as far as Ripon, but there a wretched horse and cart which a
fool of a driver--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Miss Schlegel, our little outing must be
for another day."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I was saying that this fool of a driver,
as the policeman himself admits--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Another day, Mrs. Wilcox.&#160; Of
course."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"--But as we've insured against third party
risks, it won't so much matter--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"--Cart and car being practically at right
angles--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The voices of the happy family rose
high.&#160; Margaret was left alone.&#160; No one wanted her.&#160;
Mrs. Wilcox walked out of King's Cross between her husband and her
daughter, listening to both of them.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 11</h3>
<p>The funeral was over.&#160; The carriages rolled away through
the soft mud, and only the poor remained.&#160; They approached to
the newly-dug shaft and looked their last at the coffin, now almost
hidden beneath the spadefuls of clay.&#160; It was their
moment.&#160; Most of them were women from the dead woman's
district, to whom black garments had been served out by Mr.
Wilcox's orders.&#160; Pure curiosity had brought others.&#160;
They thrilled with the excitement of a death, and of a rapid death,
and stood in groups or moved between the graves, like drops of
ink.&#160; The son of one of them, a wood-cutter, was perched high
above their heads, pollarding one of the churchyard elms.&#160;
From where he sat he could see the village of Hilton, strung upon
the North Road, with its accreting suburbs; the sunset beyond,
scarlet and orange, winking at him beneath brows of grey; the
church; the plantations; and behind him an unspoilt country of
fields and farms.&#160; But he, too, was rolling the event
luxuriously in his mouth.&#160; He tried to tell his mother down
below all that he had felt when he saw the coffin approaching: how
he could not leave his work, and yet did not like to go on with it;
how he had almost slipped out of the tree, he was so upset; the
rooks had cawed, and no wonder--it was as if rooks knew too.&#160;
His mother claimed the prophetic power herself--she had seen a
strange look about Mrs. Wilcox for some time.&#160; London had done
the mischief, said others.&#160; She had been a kind lady; her
grandmother had been kind, too--a plainer person, but very
kind.&#160; Ah, the old sort was dying out!&#160; Mr. Wilcox, he
was a kind gentleman.&#160; They advanced to the topic again and
again, dully, but with exaltation.&#160; The funeral of a rich
person was to them what the funeral of Alcestis or Ophelia is to
the educated.&#160; It was Art; though remote from life, it
enhanced life's values, and they witnessed it avidly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The grave-diggers, who had kept up an
undercurrent of disapproval--they disliked Charles; it was not a
moment to speak of such things, but they did not like Charles
Wilcox--the grave-diggers finished their work and piled up the
wreaths and crosses above it.&#160; The sun set over Hilton: the
grey brows of the evening flushed a little, and were cleft with one
scarlet frown.&#160; Chattering sadly to each other, the mourners
passed through the lych-gate and traversed the chestnut avenues
that led down to the village.&#160; The young wood-cutter stayed a
little longer, poised above the silence and swaying
rhythmically.&#160; At last the bough fell beneath his saw.&#160;
With a grunt, he descended, his thoughts dwelling no longer on
death, but on love, for he was mating.&#160; He stopped as he
passed the new grave; a sheaf of tawny chrysanthemums had caught
his eye.&#160; "They didn't ought to have coloured flowers at
buryings," he reflected.&#160; Trudging on a few steps, he stopped
again, looked furtively at the dusk, turned back, wrenched a
chrysanthemum from the sheaf, and hid it in his pocket.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After him came silence absolute.&#160; The
cottage that abutted on the churchyard was empty, and no other
house stood near.&#160; Hour after hour the scene of the interment
remained without an eye to witness it.&#160; Clouds drifted over it
from the west; or the church may have been a ship, high-prowed,
steering with all its company towards infinity.&#160; Towards
morning the air grew colder, the sky clearer, the surface of the
earth hard and sparkling above the prostrate dead.&#160; The
wood-cutter, returning after a night of joy, reflected: "They
lilies, they chrysants; it's a pity I didn't take them all."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Up at Howards End they were attempting
breakfast.&#160; Charles and Evie sat in the dining-room, with Mrs.
Charles.&#160; Their father, who could not bear to see a face,
breakfasted upstairs.&#160; He suffered acutely.&#160; Pain came
over him in spasms, as if it was physical, and even while he was
about to eat, his eyes would fill with tears, and he would lay down
the morsel untasted.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He remembered his wife's even goodness
during thirty years.&#160; Not anything in detail--not courtship or
early raptures--but just the unvarying virtue, that seemed to him a
woman's noblest quality.&#160; So many women are capricious,
breaking into odd flaws of passion or frivolity.&#160; Not so his
wife.&#160; Year after year, summer and winter, as bride and
mother, she had been the same, he had always trusted her.&#160; Her
tenderness!&#160; Her innocence!&#160; The wonderful innocence that
was hers by the gift of God.&#160; Ruth knew no more of worldly
wickedness and wisdom than did the flowers in her garden, or the
grass in her field.&#160; Her idea of business--"Henry, why do
people who have enough money try to get more money?"&#160; Her idea
of politics--"I am sure that if the mothers of various nations
could meet, there would be no more wars." Her idea of religion--ah,
this had been a cloud, but a cloud that passed.&#160; She came of
Quaker stock, and he and his family, formerly Dissenters, were now
members of the Church of England.&#160; The rector's sermons had at
first repelled her, and she had expressed a desire for "a more
inward light," adding, "not so much for myself as for baby"
(Charles).&#160; Inward light must have been granted, for he heard
no complaints in later years.&#160; They brought up their three
children without dispute.&#160; They had never disputed.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She lay under the earth now.&#160; She had
gone, and as if to make her going the more bitter, had gone with a
touch of mystery that was all unlike her.&#160; "Why didn't you
tell me you knew of it?" he had moaned, and her faint voice had
answered: "I didn't want to, Henry--I might have been wrong--and
every one hates illnesses." He had been told of the horror by a
strange doctor, whom she had consulted during his absence from
town.&#160; Was this altogether just?&#160; Without fully
explaining, she had died.&#160; It was a fault on her part,
and--tears rushed into his eyes--what a little fault!&#160; It was
the only time she had deceived him in those thirty years.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He rose to his feet and looked out of the
window, for Evie had come in with the letters, and he could meet no
one's eye.&#160; Ah yes--she had been a good woman--she had been
steady.&#160; He chose the word deliberately.&#160; To him
steadiness included all praise.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He himself, gazing at the wintry garden, is
in appearance a steady man.&#160; His face was not as square as his
son's, and, indeed, the chin, though firm enough in outline,
retreated a little, and the lips, ambiguous, were curtained by a
moustache.&#160; But there was no external hint of weakness.&#160;
The eyes, if capable of kindness and goodfellowship, if ruddy for
the moment with tears, were the eyes of one who could not be
driven.&#160; The forehead, too, was like Charles's.&#160; High and
straight, brown and polished, merging abruptly into temples and
skull, it has the effect of a bastion that protected his head from
the world.&#160; At times it had the effect of a blank wall.&#160;
He had dwelt behind it, intact and happy, for fifty years.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The post's come, Father," said Evie
awkwardly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Thanks.&#160; Put it down."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Has the breakfast been all right?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, thanks."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The girl glanced at him and at it with
constraint.&#160; She did not know what to do.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Charles says do you want the
<em>Times</em>?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, I'll read it later."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ring if you want anything, Father, won't
you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I've all I want."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Having sorted the letters from the
circulars, she went back to the dining-room.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Father's eaten nothing," she announced,
sitting down with wrinkled brows behind the tea-urn--<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles did not answer, but after a moment
he ran quickly upstairs, opened the door, and said: "Look here,
Father, you must eat, you know"; and having paused for a reply that
did not come, stole down again.&#160; "He's going to read his
letters first, I think," he said evasively; "I dare say he will go
on with his breakfast afterwards." Then he took up the
<em>Times</em>, and for some time there was no sound except the
clink of cup against saucer and of knife on plate.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Poor Mrs. Charles sat between her silent
companions, terrified at the course of events, and a little
bored.&#160; She was a rubbishy little creature, and she knew
it.&#160; A telegram had dragged her from Naples to the death-bed
of a woman whom she had scarcely known.&#160; A word from her
husband had plunged her into mourning.&#160; She desired to mourn
inwardly as well, but she wished that Mrs. Wilcox, since fated to
die, could have died before the marriage, for then less would have
been expected of her.&#160; Crumbling her toast, and too nervous to
ask for the butter, she remained almost motionless, thankful only
for this, that her father-in-law was having his breakfast
upstairs.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At last Charles spoke.&#160; "They had no
business to be pollarding those elms yesterday," he said to his
sister.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No indeed."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I must make a note of that," he
continued.&#160; "I am surprised that the rector allowed it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Perhaps it may not be the rector's
affair."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Whose else could it be?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The lord of the manor."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Impossible."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Butter, Dolly?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Thank you, Evie dear.&#160;
Charles--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, dear?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I didn't know one could pollard
elms.&#160; I thought one only pollarded willows."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh no, one can pollard elms."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then why oughtn't the elms in the
churchyard to be pollarded?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles frowned a little, and turned again
to his sister.&#160; "Another point.&#160; I must speak to
Chalkeley."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, rather; you must complain to
Chalkeley.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's no good him saying he is not
responsible for those men.&#160; He is responsible."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, rather."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Brother and sister were not callous.&#160;
They spoke thus, partly because they desired to keep Chalkeley up
to the mark--a healthy desire in its way--partly because they
avoided the personal note in life.&#160; All Wilcoxes did.&#160; It
did not seem to them of supreme importance.&#160; Or it may be as
Helen supposed: they realized its importance, but were afraid of
it. Panic and emptiness, could one glance behind.&#160; They were
not callous, and they left the breakfast-table with aching
hearts.&#160; Their mother never had come in to breakfast.&#160; It
was in the other rooms, and especially in the garden, that they
felt her loss most.&#160; As Charles went out to the garage, he was
reminded at every step of the woman who had loved him and whom he
could never replace.&#160; What battles he had fought against her
gentle conservatism!&#160; How she had disliked improvements, yet
how loyally she had accepted them when made!&#160; He and his
father--what trouble they had had to get this very garage!&#160;
With what difficulty had they persuaded her to yield them to the
paddock for it--the paddock that she loved more dearly than the
garden itself!&#160; The vine--she had got her way about the
vine.&#160; It still encumbered the south wall with its
unproductive branches.&#160; And so with Evie, as she stood talking
to the cook.&#160; Though she could take up her mother's work
inside the house, just as the man could take it up without, she
felt that something unique had fallen out of her life.&#160; Their
grief, though less poignant than their father's, grew from deeper
roots, for a wife may be replaced; a mother never.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles would go back to the office.&#160;
There was little to do at Howards End.&#160; The contents of his
mother's will had been long known to them.&#160; There were no
legacies, no annuities, none of the posthumous bustle with which
some of the dead prolong their activities.&#160; Trusting her
husband, she had left him everything without reserve.&#160; She was
quite a poor woman--the house had been all her dowry, and the house
would come to Charles in time.&#160; Her water-colours Mr. Wilcox
intended to reserve for Paul, while Evie would take the jewellery
and lace.&#160; How easily she slipped out of life!&#160; Charles
thought the habit laudable, though he did not intend to adopt it
himself, whereas Margaret would have seen in it an almost culpable
indifference to earthly fame.&#160; Cynicism--not the superficial
cynicism that snarls and sneers, but the cynicism that can go with
courtesy and tenderness--that was the note of Mrs. Wilcox's
will.&#160; She wanted not to vex people.&#160; That accomplished,
the earth might freeze over her for ever.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No, there was nothing for Charles to wait
for.&#160; He could not go on with his honeymoon, so he would go up
to London and work--he felt too miserable hanging about.&#160; He
and Dolly would have the furnished flat while his father rested
quietly in the country with Evie.&#160; He could also keep an eye
on his own little house, which was being painted and decorated for
him in one of the Surrey suburbs, and in which he hoped to install
himself soon after Christmas.&#160; Yes, he would go up after lunch
in his new motor, and the town servants, who had come down for the
funeral, would go up by train.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He found his father's chauffeur in the
garage, said, "Morning" without looking at the man's face, and,
bending over the car, continued: "Hullo!&#160; my new car's been
driven!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Has it, sir?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes," said Charles, getting rather red;
"and whoever's driven it hasn't cleaned it properly, for there's
mud on the axle.&#160; Take it off."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The man went for the cloths without a
word.&#160; He was a chauffeur as ugly as sin--not that this did
him disservice with Charles, who thought charm in a man rather rot,
and had soon got rid of the little Italian beast with whom they had
started.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Charles--" His bride was tripping after
him over the hoar-frost, a dainty black column, her little face and
elaborate mourning hat forming the capital thereof.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"One minute, I'm busy.&#160; Well, Crane,
who's been driving it, do you suppose?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Don't know, I'm sure, sir.&#160; No one's
driven it since I've been back, but, of course, there's the
fortnight I've been away with the other car in Yorkshire."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The mud came off easily.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Charles, your father's down.&#160;
Something's happened.&#160; He wants you in the house at
once.&#160; Oh, Charles!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Wait, dear, wait a minute.&#160; Who had
the key to the garage while you were away, Crane?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The gardener, sir."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do you mean to tell me that old Penny can
drive a motor?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, sir; no one's had the motor out,
sir."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then how do you account for the mud on the
axle?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I can't, of course, say for the time I've
been in Yorkshire.&#160; No more mud now, sir."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles was vexed.&#160; The man was
treating him as a fool, and if his heart had not been so heavy he
would have reported him to his father.&#160; But it was not a
morning for complaints.&#160; Ordering the motor to be round after
lunch, he joined his wife, who had all the while been pouring out
some incoherent story about a letter and a Miss Schlegel.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Now, Dolly, I can attend to you.&#160;
Miss Schlegel?&#160; What does she want?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When people wrote a letter Charles always
asked what they wanted.&#160; Want was to him the only cause of
action.&#160; And the question in this case was correct, for his
wife replied, "She wants Howards End."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Howards End?&#160; Now, Crane, just don't
forget to put on the Stepney wheel."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, sir."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Now, mind you don't forget, for I--Come,
little woman." When they were out of the chauffeur's sight he put
his arm around her waist and pressed her against him.&#160; All his
affection and half his attention--it was what he granted her
throughout their happy married life.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But you haven't listened, Charles--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What's wrong?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I keep on telling you--Howards End.&#160;
Miss Schlegels got it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Got what?" asked Charles, unclasping
her.&#160; "What the dickens are you talking about?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Now, Charles, you promised not to say
those naughty--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Look here, I'm in no mood for
foolery.&#160; It's no morning for it either."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I tell you--I keep on telling you--Miss
Schlegel--she's got it--your mother's left it to her--and you've
all got to move out!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"<em>Howards End?</em>"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"<em>Howards End!</em>" she screamed,
mimicking him, and as she did so Evie came dashing out of the
shrubbery.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Dolly, go back at once!&#160; My father's
much annoyed with you.&#160; Charles"--she hit herself
wildly--"come in at once to Father.&#160; He's had a letter that's
too awful."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles began to run, but checked himself,
and stepped heavily across the gravel path.&#160; There the house
was--the nine windows, the unprolific vine.&#160; He exclaimed,
"Schlegels again!" and as if to complete chaos, Dolly said, "Oh no,
the matron of the nursing home has written instead of her."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Come in, all three of you!" cried his
father, no longer inert.&#160; "Dolly, why have you disobeyed
me?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, Mr. Wilcox--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I told you not to go out to the
garage.&#160; I've heard you all shouting in the garden.&#160; I
won't have it.&#160; Come in."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He stood in the porch, transformed, letters
in his hand.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Into the dining-room, every one of
you.&#160; We can't discuss private matters in the middle of all
the servants.&#160; Here, Charles, here; read these.&#160; See what
you make."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles took two letters, and read them as
he followed the procession.&#160; The first was a covering note
from the matron.&#160; Mrs. Wilcox had desired her, when the
funeral should be over, to forward the enclosed.&#160; The
enclosed--it was from his mother herself.&#160; She had written:
"To my husband: I should like Miss Schlegel (Margaret) to have
Howards End."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I suppose we're going to have a talk about
this?" he remarked, ominously calm.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Certainly.&#160; I was coming out to you
when Dolly--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, let's sit down."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Come, Evie, don't waste time, sit
down."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In silence they drew up to the
breakfast-table.&#160; The events of yesterday--indeed, of this
morning--suddenly receded into a past so remote that they seemed
scarcely to have lived in it.&#160; Heavy breathings were
heard.&#160; They were calming themselves.&#160; Charles, to steady
them further, read the enclosure out loud: "A note in my mother's
handwriting, in an envelope addressed to my father, sealed.&#160;
Inside: 'I should like Miss Schlegel (Margaret) to have Howards
End.' No date, no signature.&#160; Forwarded through the matron of
that nursing home.&#160; Now, the question is--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dolly interrupted him.&#160; "But I say
that note isn't legal.&#160; Houses ought to be done by a lawyer,
Charles, surely."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Her husband worked his jaw severely.&#160;
Little lumps appeared in front of either ear--a symptom that she
had not yet learnt to respect, and she asked whether she might see
the note.&#160; Charles looked at his father for permission, who
said abstractedly, "Give it her." She seized it, and at once
exclaimed: "Why, it's only in pencil!&#160; I said so.&#160; Pencil
never counts."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We know that it is not legally binding,
Dolly," said Mr. Wilcox, speaking from out of his fortress.&#160;
"We are aware of that.&#160; Legally, I should be justified in
tearing it up and throwing it into the fire.&#160; Of course, my
dear, we consider you as one of the family, but it will be better
if you do not interfere with what you do not understand."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles, vexed both with his father and his
wife, then repeated: "The question is--" He had cleared a space of
the breakfast-table from plates and knives, so that he could draw
patterns on the tablecloth.&#160; "The question is whether Miss
Schlegel, during the fortnight we were all away, whether she
unduly--" He stopped.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't think that," said his father,
whose nature was nobler than his son's<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Don't think what?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That she would have--that it is a case of
undue influence.&#160; No, to my mind the question is the--the
invalid's condition at the time she wrote."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"My dear father, consult an expert if you
like, but I don't admit it is my mother's writing."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why, you just said it was!" cried
Dolly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Never mind if I did," he blazed out; "and
hold your tongue."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The poor little wife coloured at this, and,
drawing her handkerchief from her pocket, shed a few tears.&#160;
No one noticed her.&#160; Evie was scowling like an angry
boy.&#160; The two men were gradually assuming the manner of the
committee-room.&#160; They were both at their best when serving on
committees.&#160; They did not make the mistake of handling human
affairs in the bulk, but disposed of them item by item,
sharply.&#160; Calligraphy was the item before them now, and on it
they turned their well-trained brains.&#160; Charles, after a
little demur, accepted the writing as genuine, and they passed on
to the next point.&#160; It is the best--perhaps the only--way of
dodging emotion.&#160; They were the average human article, and had
they considered the note as a whole it would have driven them
miserable or mad.&#160; Considered item by item, the emotional
content was minimized, and all went forward smoothly.&#160; The
clock ticked, the coals blazed higher, and contended with the white
radiance that poured in through the windows.&#160; Unnoticed, the
sun occupied his sky, and the shadows of the tree stems,
extraordinarily solid, fell like trenches of purple across the
frosted lawn.&#160; It was a glorious winter morning.&#160; Evie's
fox terrier, who had passed for white, was only a dirty grey dog
now, so intense was the purity that surrounded him.&#160; He was
discredited, but the blackbirds that he was chasing glowed with
Arabian darkness, for all the conventional colouring of life had
been altered.&#160; Inside, the clock struck ten with a rich and
confident note.&#160; Other clocks confirmed it, and the discussion
moved towards its close.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To follow it is unnecessary.&#160; It is
rather a moment when the commentator should step forward.&#160;
Ought the Wilcoxes to have offered their home to Margaret?&#160; I
think not.&#160; The appeal was too flimsy.&#160; It was not legal;
it had been written in illness, and under the spell of a sudden
friendship; it was contrary to the dead woman's intentions in the
past, contrary to her very nature, so far as that nature was
understood by them.&#160; To them Howards End was a house: they
could not know that to her it had been a spirit, for which she
sought a spiritual heir.&#160; And--pushing one step farther in
these mists--may they not have decided even better than they
supposed?&#160; Is it credible that the possessions of the spirit
can be bequeathed at all?&#160; Has the soul offspring?&#160; A
wych-elm tree, a vine, a wisp of hay with dew on it--can passion
for such things be transmitted where there is no bond of
blood?&#160; No; the Wilcoxes are not to be blamed.&#160; The
problem is too terrific, and they could not even perceive a
problem.&#160; No; it is natural and fitting that after due debate
they should tear the note up and throw it on to their dining-room
fire.&#160; The practical moralist may acquit them
absolutely.&#160; He who strives to look deeper may acquit
them--almost.&#160; For one hard fact remains.&#160; They did
neglect a personal appeal.&#160; The woman who had died did say to
them, "Do this," and they answered, "We will not."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The incident made a most painful impression
on them.&#160; Grief mounted into the brain and worked there
disquietingly.&#160; Yesterday they had lamented: "She was a dear
mother, a true wife: in our absence she neglected her health and
died." Today they thought: "She was not as true, as dear, as we
supposed."&#160; The desire for a more inward light had found
expression at last, the unseen had impacted on the seen, and all
that they could say was "Treachery." Mrs. Wilcox had been
treacherous to the family, to the laws of property, to her own
written word.&#160; How did she expect Howards End to be conveyed
to Miss Schlegel?&#160; Was her husband, to whom it legally
belonged, to make it over to her as a free gift?&#160; Was the said
Miss Schlegel to have a life interest in it, or to own it
absolutely?&#160; Was there to be no compensation for the garage
and other improvements that they had made under the assumption that
all would be theirs some day?&#160; Treacherous!&#160; treacherous
and absurd!&#160; When we think the dead both treacherous and
absurd, we have gone far towards reconciling ourselves to their
departure.&#160; That note, scribbled in pencil, sent through the
matron, was unbusinesslike as well as cruel, and decreased at once
the value of the woman who had written it.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ah, well!" said Mr. Wilcox, rising from
the table.&#160; "I shouldn't have thought it possible."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Mother couldn't have meant it," said Evie,
still frowning.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, my girl, of course not."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Mother believed so in ancestors too--it
isn't like her to leave anything to an outsider, who'd never
appreciate.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The whole thing is unlike her," he
announced.&#160; "If Miss Schlegel had been poor, if she had wanted
a house, I could understand it a little.&#160; But she has a house
of her own.&#160; Why should she want another?&#160; She wouldn't
have any use of Howards End."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That time may prove," murmured
Charles.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How?" asked his sister.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Presumably she knows--mother will have
told her.&#160; She got twice or three times into the nursing
home.&#160; Presumably she is awaiting developments."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What a horrid woman!"&#160; And Dolly, who
had recovered, cried, "Why, she may be coming down to turn us out
now!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles put her right.&#160; "I wish she
would," he said ominously.&#160; "I could then deal with
her."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So could I," echoed his father, who was
feeling rather in the cold.&#160; Charles had been kind in
undertaking the funeral arrangements and in telling him to eat his
breakfast, but the boy as he grew up was a little dictatorial, and
assumed the post of chairman too readily.&#160; "I could deal with
her, if she comes, but she won't come.&#160; You're all a bit hard
on Miss Schlegel."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That Paul business was pretty scandalous,
though."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I want no more of the Paul business,
Charles, as I said at the time, and besides, it is quite apart from
this business.&#160; Margaret Schlegel has been officious and
tiresome during this terrible week, and we have all suffered under
her, but upon my soul she's honest.&#160; She's not in collusion
with the matron.&#160; I'm absolutely certain of it.&#160; Nor was
she with the doctor.&#160; I'm equally certain of that.&#160; She
did not hide anything from us, for up to that very afternoon she
was as ignorant as we are.&#160; She, like ourselves, was a
dupe--"&#160; He stopped for a moment.&#160; "You see, Charles, in
her terrible pain your poor mother put us all in false
positions.&#160; Paul would not have left England, you would not
have gone to Italy, nor Evie and I into Yorkshire, if only we had
known.&#160; Well, Miss Schlegel's position has been equally
false.&#160; Take all in all, she has not come out of it
badly."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Evie said: "But those
chrysanthemums--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Or coming down to the funeral at all--"
echoed Dolly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why shouldn't she come down?&#160; She had
the right to, and she stood far back among the Hilton women.&#160;
The flowers--certainly we should not have sent such flowers, but
they may have seemed the right thing to her, Evie, and for all you
know they may be the custom in Germany.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, I forget she isn't really English,"
cried Evie.&#160; "That would explain a lot."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She's a cosmopolitan," said Charles,
looking at his watch.&#160; "I admit I'm rather down on
cosmopolitans.&#160; My fault, doubtless.&#160; I cannot stand
them, and a German cosmopolitan is the limit.&#160; I think that's
about all, isn't it?&#160; I want to run down and see
Chalkeley.&#160; A bicycle will do.&#160; And, by the way, I wish
you'd speak to Crane some time.&#160; I'm certain he's had my new
car out."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Has he done it any harm?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In that case I shall let it pass.&#160;
It's not worth while having a row."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles and his father sometimes
disagreed.&#160; But they always parted with an increased regard
for one another, and each desired no doughtier comrade when it was
necessary to voyage for a little past the emotions.&#160; So the
sailors of Ulysses voyaged past the Sirens, having first stopped
one another's ears with wool.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 12</h3>
<p>Charles need not have been anxious.&#160; Miss Schlegel had
never heard of his mother's strange request.&#160; She was to hear
of it in after years, when she had built up her life differently,
and it was to fit into position as the headstone of the
corner.&#160; Her mind was bent on other questions now, and by her
also it would have been rejected as the fantasy of an
invalid.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She was parting from these Wilcoxes for the
second time.&#160; Paul and his mother, ripple and great wave, had
flowed into her life and ebbed out of it for ever.&#160; The ripple
had left no traces behind: the wave had strewn at her feet
fragments torn from the unknown.&#160; A curious seeker, she stood
for a while at the verge of the sea that tells so little, but tells
a little, and watched the outgoing of this last tremendous
tide.&#160; Her friend had vanished in agony, but not, she
believed, in degradation.&#160; Her withdrawal had hinted at other
things besides disease and pain.&#160; Some leave our life with
tears, others with an insane frigidity; Mrs. Wilcox had taken the
middle course, which only rarer natures can pursue.&#160; She had
kept proportion.&#160; She had told a little of her grim secret to
her friends, but not too much; she had shut up her heart--almost,
but not entirely.&#160; It is thus, if there is any rule, that we
ought to die--neither as victim nor as fanatic, but as the seafarer
who can greet with an equal eye the deep that he is entering, and
the shore that he must leave.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The last word--whatever it would be--had
certainly not been said in Hilton churchyard.&#160; She had not
died there.&#160; A funeral is not death, any more than baptism is
birth or marriage union.&#160; All three are the clumsy devices,
coming now too late, now too early, by which Society would register
the quick motions of man.&#160; In Margaret's eyes Mrs. Wilcox had
escaped registration.&#160; She had gone out of life vividly, her
own way, and no dust was so truly dust as the contents of that
heavy coffin, lowered with ceremonial until it rested on the dust
of the earth, no flowers so utterly wasted as the chrysanthemums
that the frost must have withered before morning.&#160; Margaret
had once said she "loved superstition." It was not true.&#160; Few
women had tried more earnestly to pierce the accretions in which
body and soul are enwrapped.&#160; The death of Mrs. Wilcox had
helped her in her work.&#160; She saw a little more clearly than
hitherto what a human being is, and to what he may aspire.&#160;
Truer relationships gleamed.&#160; Perhaps the last word would be
hope--hope even on this side of the grave.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile, she could take an interest in
the survivors.&#160; In spite of her Christmas duties, in spite of
her brother, the Wilcoxes continued to play a considerable part in
her thoughts.&#160; She had seen so much of them in the final
week.&#160; They were not "her sort," they were often suspicious
and stupid, and deficient where she excelled; but collision with
them stimulated her, and she felt an interest that verged into
liking, even for Charles.&#160; She desired to protect them, and
often felt that they could protect her, excelling where she was
deficient.&#160; Once past the rocks of emotion, they knew so well
what to do, whom to send for; their hands were on all the ropes,
they had grit as well as grittiness, and she valued grit
enormously.&#160; They led a life that she could not attain to--the
outer life of "telegrams and anger," which had detonated when Helen
and Paul had touched in June, and had detonated again the other
week.&#160; To Margaret this life was to remain a real force.&#160;
She could not despise it, as Helen and Tibby affected to do.&#160;
It fostered such virtues as neatness, decision, and obedience,
virtues of the second rank, no doubt, but they have formed our
civilization.&#160; They form character, too; Margaret could not
doubt it: they keep the soul from becoming sloppy.&#160; How dare
Schlegels despise Wilcoxes, when it takes all sorts to make a
world?&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Don't brood too much," she wrote to Helen,
"on the superiority of the unseen to the seen.&#160; It's true, but
to brood on it is mediaeval.&#160; Our business is not to contrast
the two, but to reconcile them."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen replied that she had no intention of
brooding on such a dull subject.&#160; What did her sister take her
for?&#160; The weather was magnificent.&#160; She and the Mosebachs
had gone tobogganing on the only hill that Pomerania boasted.&#160;
It was fun, but overcrowded, for the rest of Pomerania had gone
there too.&#160; Helen loved the country, and her letter glowed
with physical exercise and poetry.&#160; She spoke of the scenery,
quiet, yet august; of the snow-clad fields, with their scampering
herds of deer; of the river and its quaint entrance into the Baltic
Sea; of the Oderberge, only three hundred feet high, from which one
slid all too quickly back into the Pomeranian plains, and yet these
Oderberge were real mountains, with pine-forests, streams, and
views complete.&#160; "It isn't size that counts so much as the way
things are arranged." In another paragraph she referred to Mrs.
Wilcox sympathetically, but the news had not bitten into her.&#160;
She had not realized the accessories of death, which are in a sense
more memorable than death itself.&#160; The atmosphere of
precautions and recriminations, and in the midst a human body
growing more vivid because it was in pain; the end of that body in
Hilton churchyard; the survival of something that suggested hope,
vivid in its turn against life's workaday cheerfulness;--all these
were lost to Helen, who only felt that a pleasant lady could now be
pleasant no longer.&#160; She returned to Wickham Place full of her
own affairs--she had had another proposal--and Margaret, after a
moment's hesitation, was content that this should be so.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The proposal had not been a serious
matter.&#160; It was the work of Fr&#228;ulein Mosebach, who had
conceived the large and patriotic notion of winning back her
cousins to the Fatherland by matrimony.&#160; England had played
Paul Wilcox, and lost; Germany played Herr F&#246;rstmeister
someone--Helen could not remember his name.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Herr F&#246;rstmeister lived in a wood, and
standing on the summit of the Oderberge, he had pointed out his
house to Helen, or rather, had pointed out the wedge of pines in
which it lay.&#160; She had exclaimed, "Oh, how lovely!&#160;
That's the place for me!" and in the evening Frieda appeared in her
bedroom.&#160; "I have a message, dear Helen," etc., and so she
had, but had been very nice when Helen laughed; quite understood--a
forest too solitary and damp--quite agreed, but Herr
F&#246;rstmeister believed he had assurance to the contrary.&#160;
Germany had lost, but with good-humour; holding the manhood of the
world, she felt bound to win.&#160; "And there will even be someone
for Tibby," concluded Helen.&#160; "There now, Tibby, think of
that; Frieda is saving up a little girl for you, in pig-tails and
white worsted stockings, but the feet of the stockings are pink, as
if the little girl had trodden in strawberries.&#160; I've talked
too much.&#160; My head aches.&#160; Now you talk."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tibby consented to talk.&#160; He too was
full of his own affairs, for he had just been up to try for a
scholarship at Oxford.&#160; The men were down, and the candidates
had been housed in various colleges, and had dined in hall.&#160;
Tibby was sensitive to beauty, the experience was new, and he gave
a description of his visit that was almost glowing.&#160; The
august and mellow University, soaked with the richness of the
western counties that it has served for a thousand years, appealed
at once to the boy's taste: it was the kind of thing he could
understand, and he understood it all the better because it was
empty.&#160; Oxford is--Oxford: not a mere receptacle for youth,
like Cambridge.&#160; Perhaps it wants its inmates to love it
rather than to love one another: such at all events was to be its
effect on Tibby.&#160; His sisters sent him there that he might
make friends, for they knew that his education had been cranky, and
had severed him from other boys and men.&#160; He made no
friends.&#160; His Oxford remained Oxford empty, and he took into
life with him, not the memory of a radiance, but the memory of a
colour scheme.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It pleased Margaret to hear her brother and
sister talking.&#160; They did not get on overwell as a rule.&#160;
For a few moments she listened to them, feeling elderly and
benign.&#160; Then something occurred to her, and she
interrupted:<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Helen, I told you about poor Mrs. Wilcox;
that sad business?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I have had a correspondence with her
son.&#160; He was winding up the estate, and wrote to ask me
whether his mother had wanted me to have anything.&#160; I thought
it good of him, considering I knew her so little.&#160; I said that
she had once spoken of giving me a Christmas present, but we both
forgot about it afterwards."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I hope Charles took the hint."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes--that is to say, her husband wrote
later on, and thanked me for being a little kind to her, and
actually gave me her silver vinaigrette.&#160; Don't you think that
is extraordinarily generous?&#160; It has made me like him very
much.&#160; He hopes that this will not be the end of our
acquaintance, but that you and I will go and stop with Evie some
time in the future.&#160; I like Mr. Wilcox.&#160; He is taking up
his work--rubber--it is a big business.&#160; I gather he is
launching out rather.&#160; Charles is in it, too.&#160; Charles is
married--a pretty little creature, but she doesn't seem wise.&#160;
They took on the flat, but now they have gone off to a house of
their own."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen, after a decent pause, continued her
account of Stettin.&#160; How quickly a situation changes!&#160; In
June she had been in a crisis; even in November she could blush and
be unnatural; now it was January, and the whole affair lay
forgotten.&#160; Looking back on the past six months, Margaret
realized the chaotic nature of our daily life, and its difference
from the orderly sequence that has been fabricated by
historians.&#160; Actual life is full of false clues and sign-posts
that lead nowhere.&#160; With infinite effort we nerve ourselves
for a crisis that never comes.&#160; The most successful career
must show a waste of strength that might have removed mountains,
and the most unsuccessful is not that of the man who is taken
unprepared, but of him who has prepared and is never taken.&#160;
On a tragedy of that kind our national morality is duly
silent.&#160; It assumes that preparation against danger is in
itself a good, and that men, like nations, are the better for
staggering through life fully armed.&#160; The tragedy of
preparedness has scarcely been handled, save by the Greeks.&#160;
Life is indeed dangerous, but not in the way morality would have us
believe.&#160; It is indeed unmanageable, but the essence of it is
not a battle.&#160; It is unmanageable because it is a romance, and
its essence is romantic beauty.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret hoped that for the future she
would be less cautious, not more cautious, than she had been in the
past.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 13</h3>
<p>Over two years passed, and the Schlegel household continued to
lead its life of cultured but not ignoble ease, still swimming
gracefully on the grey tides of London.&#160; Concerts and plays
swept past them, money had been spent and renewed, reputations won
and lost, and the city herself, emblematic of their lives, rose and
fell in a continual flux, while her shallows washed more widely
against the hills of Surrey and over the fields of
Hertfordshire.&#160; This famous building had arisen, that was
doomed.&#160; Today Whitehall had been transformed: it would be the
turn of Regent Street tomorrow.&#160; And month by month the roads
smelt more strongly of petrol, and were more difficult to cross,
and human beings heard each other speak with greater difficulty,
breathed less of the air, and saw less of the sky.&#160; Nature
withdrew: the leaves were falling by midsummer; the sun shone
through dirt with an admired obscurity.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To speak against London is no longer
fashionable.&#160; The Earth as an artistic cult has had its day,
and the literature of the near future will probably ignore the
country and seek inspiration from the town.&#160; One can
understand the reaction.&#160; Of Pan and the elemental forces, the
public has heard a little too much--they seem Victorian, while
London is Georgian--and those who care for the earth with sincerity
may wait long ere the pendulum swings back to her again.&#160;
Certainly London fascinates.&#160; One visualizes it as a tract of
quivering grey, intelligent without purpose, and excitable without
love; as a spirit that has altered before it can be chronicled; as
a heart that certainly beats, but with no pulsation of
humanity.&#160; It lies beyond everything: Nature, with all her
cruelty, comes nearer to us than do these crowds of men.&#160; A
friend explains himself: the earth is explicable--from her we came,
and we must return to her.&#160; But who can explain Westminster
Bridge Road or Liverpool Street in the morning--the city
inhaling--or the same thoroughfares in the evening--the city
exhaling her exhausted air?&#160; We reach in desperation beyond
the fog, beyond the very stars, the voids of the universe are
ransacked to justify the monster, and stamped with a human
face.&#160; London is religion's opportunity--not the decorous
religion of theologians, but anthropomorphic, crude.&#160; Yes, the
continuous flow would be tolerable if a man of our own sort--not
anyone pompous or tearful--were caring for us up in the sky.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Londoner seldom understands his city
until it sweeps him, too, away from his moorings, and Margaret's
eyes were not opened until the lease of Wickham Place
expired.&#160; She had always known that it must expire, but the
knowledge only became vivid about nine months before the
event.&#160; Then the house was suddenly ringed with pathos.&#160;
It had seen so much happiness.&#160; Why had it to be swept
away?&#160; In the streets of the city she noted for the first time
the architecture of hurry, and heard the language of hurry on the
mouths of its inhabitants--clipped words, formless sentences,
potted expressions of approval or disgust.&#160; Month by month
things were stepping livelier, but to what goal?&#160; The
population still rose, but what was the quality of the men
born?&#160; The particular millionaire who owned the freehold of
Wickham Place, and desired to erect Babylonian flats upon it--what
right had he to stir so large a portion of the quivering
jelly?&#160; He was not a fool--she had heard him expose
Socialism--but true insight began just where his intelligence
ended, and one gathered that this was the case with most
millionaires.&#160; What right had such men--But Margaret checked
herself.&#160; That way lies madness.&#160; Thank goodness she,
too, had some money, and could purchase a new home.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tibby, now in his second year at Oxford,
was down for the Easter vacation, and Margaret took the opportunity
of having a serious talk with him.&#160; Did he at all know where
he wanted to live?&#160; Tibby didn't know that he did know.&#160;
Did he at all know what he wanted to do?&#160; He was equally
uncertain, but when pressed remarked that he should prefer to be
quite free of any profession.&#160; Margaret was not shocked, but
went on sewing for a few minutes before she replied:<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I was thinking of Mr. Vyse.&#160; He never
strikes me as particularly happy."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ye-es," said Tibby, and then held his
mouth open in a curious quiver, as if he, too, had thoughts of Mr.
Vyse, had seen round, through, over, and beyond Mr. Vyse, had
weighed Mr. Vyse, grouped him, and finally dismissed him as having
no possible bearing on the subject under discussion.&#160; That
bleat of Tibby's infuriated Helen.&#160; But Helen was now down in
the dining-room preparing a speech about political economy.&#160;
At times her voice could be heard declaiming through the
floor.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But Mr. Vyse is rather a wretched, weedy
man, don't you think?&#160; Then there's Guy.&#160; That was a
pitiful business.&#160; Besides"--shifting to the general--" every
one is the better for some regular work."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Groans.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I shall stick to it," she continued,
smiling.&#160; "I am not saying it to educate you; it is what I
really think.&#160; I believe that in the last century men have
developed the desire for work, and they must not starve it.&#160;
It's a new desire.&#160; It goes with a great deal that's bad, but
in itself it's good, and I hope that for women, too, 'not to work'
will soon become as shocking as 'not to be married' was a hundred
years ago."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I have no experience of this profound
desire to which you allude," enunciated Tibby.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then we'll leave the subject till you
do.&#160; I'm not going to rattle you round.&#160; Take your
time.&#160; Only do think over the lives of the men you like most,
and see how they've arranged them."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I like Guy and Mr. Vyse most," said Tibby
faintly, and leant so far back in his chair that he extended in a
horizontal line from knees to throat.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And don't think I'm not serious because I
don't use the traditional arguments--making money, a sphere
awaiting you, and so on--all of which are, for various reasons,
cant." She sewed on.&#160; "I'm only your sister.&#160; I haven't
any authority over you, and I don't want to have any.&#160; Just to
put before you what I think the truth.&#160; You see"--she shook
off the pince-nez to which she had recently taken--"in a few years
we shall be the same age practically, and I shall want you to help
me.&#160; Men are so much nicer than women."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Labouring under such a delusion, why do
you not marry?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I sometimes jolly well think I would if I
got the chance."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Has nobody arst you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Only ninnies."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do people ask Helen?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Plentifully."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Tell me about them."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Tell me about your ninnies, then."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"They were men who had nothing better to
do," said his sister, feeling that she was entitled to score this
point.&#160; "So take warning: you must work, or else you must
pretend to work, which is what I do.&#160; Work, work, work if
you'd save your soul and your body.&#160; It is honestly a
necessity, dear boy.&#160; Look at the Wilcoxes, look at Mr.
Pembroke.&#160; With all their defects of temper and understanding,
such men give me more pleasure than many who are better equipped
and I think it is because they have worked regularly and
honestly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Spare me the Wilcoxes," he moaned.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I shall not.&#160; They are the right
sort."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, goodness me, Meg!" he protested,
suddenly sitting up, alert and angry.&#160; Tibby, for all his
defects, had a genuine personality.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, they're as near the right sort as
you can imagine."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, no--oh, no!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I was thinking of the younger son, whom I
once classed as a ninny, but who came back so ill from
Nigeria.&#160; He's gone out there again, Evie Wilcox tells me--out
to his duty."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Duty" always elicited a groan.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He doesn't want the money, it is work he
wants, though it is beastly work--dull country, dishonest natives,
an eternal fidget over fresh water and food.&#160; A nation who can
produce men of that sort may well be proud.&#160; No wonder England
has become an Empire."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"<em>Empire!</em>"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I can't bother over results," said
Margaret, a little sadly.&#160; "They are too difficult for
me.&#160; I can only look at the men.&#160; An Empire bores me, so
far, but I can appreciate the heroism that builds it up.&#160;
London bores me, but what thousands of splendid people are
labouring to make London--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What it is," he sneered.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What it is, worse luck.&#160; I want
activity without civilization.&#160; How paradoxical!&#160; Yet I
expect that is what we shall find in heaven."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And I," said Tibby, "want civilization
without activity, which, I expect, is what we shall find in the
other place."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You needn't go as far as the other place,
Tibbi-kins, if you want that.&#160; You can find it at
Oxford."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Stupid--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If I'm stupid, get me back to the
house-hunting.&#160; I'll even live in Oxford if you like--North
Oxford.&#160; I'll live anywhere except Bournemouth, Torquay, and
Cheltenham.&#160; Oh yes, or Ilfracombe and Swanage and Tunbridge
Wells and Surbiton and Bedford.&#160; There on no account."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"London, then."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I agree, but Helen rather wants to get
away from London.&#160; However, there's no reason we shouldn't
have a house in the country and also a flat in town, provided we
all stick together and contribute.&#160; Though of course--Oh, how
one does maunder on, and to think, to think of the people who are
really poor.&#160; How do they live?&#160; Not to move about the
world would kill me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As she spoke, the door was flung open, and
Helen burst in in a state of extreme excitement.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, my dears, what do you think?&#160;
You'll never guess.&#160; A woman's been here asking me for her
husband.&#160; Her <em>what?</em>"&#160; (Helen was fond of
supplying her own surprise.)&#160; "Yes, for her husband, and it
really is so."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not anything to do with Bracknell?" cried
Margaret, who had lately taken on an unemployed of that name to
clean the knives and boots.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I offered Bracknell, and he was
rejected.&#160; So was Tibby. (Cheer up, Tibby!) It's no one we
know.&#160; I said, 'Hunt, my good woman; have a good look round,
hunt under the tables, poke up the chimney, shake out the
antimacassars.&#160; Husband?&#160; husband?' Oh, and she so
magnificently dressed and tinkling like a chandelier."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Now, Helen, what did happen really?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What I say.&#160; I was, as it were,
orating my speech.&#160; Annie opens the door like a fool, and
shows a female straight in on me, with my mouth open.&#160; Then we
began--very civilly.&#160; 'I want my husband, what I have reason
to believe is here.' No--how unjust one is.&#160; She said 'whom,'
not 'what.' She got it perfectly.&#160; So I said, 'Name, please?'
and she said, 'Lan, Miss,' and there we were.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Lan?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Lan or Len.&#160; We were not nice about
our vowels.&#160; Lanoline."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But what an extraordinary--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I said, 'My good Mrs. Lanoline, we have
some grave misunderstanding here.&#160; Beautiful as I am, my
modesty is even more remarkable than my beauty, and never, never
has Mr. Lanoline rested his eyes on mine.'"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I hope you were pleased," said
Tibby.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Of course," Helen squeaked.&#160; "A
perfectly delightful experience.&#160; Oh, Mrs. Lanoline's a
dear--she asked for a husband as if he was an umbrella.&#160; She
mislaid him Saturday afternoon--and for a long time suffered no
inconvenience.&#160; But all night, and all this morning her
apprehensions grew.&#160; Breakfast didn't seem the same--no, no
more did lunch, and so she strolled up to 2, Wickham Place as being
the most likely place for the missing article."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But how on earth--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Don't begin how on earthing.&#160; 'I know
what I know,' she kept repeating, not uncivilly, but with extreme
gloom.&#160; In vain I asked her what she did know.&#160; Some knew
what others knew, and others didn't, and if they didn't, then
others again had better be careful.&#160; Oh dear, she was
incompetent!&#160; She had a face like a silkworm, and the
dining-room reeks of orris-root.&#160; We chatted pleasantly a
little about husbands, and I wondered where hers was too, and
advised her to go to the police.&#160; She thanked me.&#160; We
agreed that Mr. Lanoline's a notty, notty man, and hasn't no
business to go on the lardy-da.&#160; But I think she suspected me
up to the last.&#160; Bags I writing to Aunt Juley about
this.&#160; Now, Meg, remember--bags I."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Bag it by all means," murmured Margaret,
putting down her work.&#160; "I'm not sure that this is so funny,
Helen.&#160; It means some horrible volcano smoking somewhere,
doesn't it?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't think so--she doesn't really
mind.&#160; The admirable creature isn't capable of tragedy."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Her husband may be, though," said
Margaret, moving to the window.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, no, not likely.&#160; No one capable
of tragedy could have married Mrs. Lanoline."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Was she pretty?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Her figure may have been good once."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The flats, their only outlook, hung like an
ornate curtain between Margaret and the welter of London.&#160; Her
thoughts turned sadly to house-hunting.&#160; Wickham Place had
been so safe.&#160; She feared, fantastically, that her own little
flock might be moving into turmoil and squalor, into nearer contact
with such episodes as these.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Tibby and I have again been wondering
where we'll live next September," she said at last.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Tibby had better first wonder what he'll
do," retorted Helen; and that topic was resumed, but with
acrimony.&#160; Then tea came, and after tea Helen went on
preparing her speech, and Margaret prepared one, too, for they were
going out to a discussion society on the morrow.&#160; But her
thoughts were poisoned.&#160; Mrs. Lanoline had risen out of the
abyss, like a faint smell, a goblin football, telling of a life
where love and hatred had both decayed.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 14</h3>
<p>The mystery, like so many mysteries, was explained.&#160; Next
day, just as they were dressed to go out to dinner, a Mr. Bast
called.&#160; He was a clerk in the employment of the Porphyrion
Fire Insurance Company.&#160; Thus much from his card.&#160; He had
come "about the lady yesterday." Thus much from Annie, who had
shown him into the dining-room.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Cheers, children!" cried Helen.&#160;
"It's Mrs. Lanoline."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tibby was interested.&#160; The three
hurried downstairs, to find, not the gay dog they expected, but a
young man, colourless, toneless, who had already the mournful eyes
above a drooping moustache that are so common in London, and that
haunt some streets of the city like accusing presences.&#160; One
guessed him as the third generation, grandson to the shepherd or
ploughboy whom civilization had sucked into the town; as one of the
thousands who have lost the life of the body and failed to reach
the life of the spirit.&#160; Hints of robustness survived in him,
more than a hint of primitive good looks, and Margaret, noting the
spine that might have been straight, and the chest that might have
broadened, wondered whether it paid to give up the glory of the
animal for a tail coat and a couple of ideas.&#160; Culture had
worked in her own case, but during the last few weeks she had
doubted whether it humanized the majority, so wide and so widening
is the gulf that stretches between the natural and the philosophic
man, so many the good chaps who are wrecked in trying to cross
it.&#160; She knew this type very well--the vague aspirations, the
mental dishonesty, the familiarity with the outsides of
books.&#160; She knew the very tones in which he would address
her.&#160; She was only unprepared for an example of her own
visiting-card.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You wouldn't remember giving me this, Miss
Schlegel?" said he, uneasily familiar.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No; I can't say I do."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, that was how it happened, you
see."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Where did we meet, Mr. Bast?&#160; For the
minute I don't remember."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It was a concert at the Queen's
Hall.&#160; I think you will recollect," he added pretentiously,
"when I tell you that it included a performance of the Fifth
Symphony of Beethoven."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We hear the Fifth practically every time
it's done, so I'm not sure--do you remember, Helen?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Was it the time the sandy cat walked round
the balustrade?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He thought not.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then I don't remember.&#160; That's the
only Beethoven I ever remember specially."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And you, if I may say so, took away my
umbrella, inadvertently of course."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Likely enough," Helen laughed, "for I
steal umbrellas even oftener than I hear Beethoven.&#160; Did you
get it back?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, thank you, Miss Schlegel."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The mistake arose out of my card, did it?"
interposed Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, the mistake arose--it was a
mistake."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The lady who called here yesterday thought
that you were calling too, and that she could find you?" she
continued, pushing him forward, for, though he had promised an
explanation, he seemed unable to give one.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's so, calling too--a mistake."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then why--?" began Helen, but Margaret
laid a hand on her arm.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I said to my wife," he continued more
rapidly--"I said to Mrs. Bast, 'I have to pay a call on some
friends,' and Mrs. Bast said to me, 'Do go.' While I was gone,
however, she wanted me on important business, and thought I had
come here, owing to the card, and so came after me, and I beg to
tender my apologies, and hers as well, for any inconvenience we may
have inadvertently caused you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No inconvenience," said Helen; "but I
still don't understand."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An air of evasion characterized Mr.
Bast.&#160; He explained again, but was obviously lying, and Helen
didn't see why he should get off.&#160; She had the cruelty of
youth.&#160; Neglecting her sister's pressure, she said, "I still
don't understand.&#160; When did you say you paid this call?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Call?&#160; What call?" said he, staring
as if her question had been a foolish one, a favourite device of
those in mid-stream.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"This afternoon call."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In the afternoon, of course!" he replied,
and looked at Tibby to see how the repartee went.&#160; But Tibby,
himself a repartee, was unsympathetic, and said, "Saturday
afternoon or Sunday afternoon?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"S-Saturday."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Really!" said Helen; "and you were still
calling on Sunday, when your wife came here.&#160; A long
visit."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't call that fair," said Mr. Bast,
going scarlet and handsome.&#160; There was fight in his
eyes."&#160; I know what you mean, and it isn't so."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, don't let us mind," said Margaret,
distressed again by odours from the abyss.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It was something else," he asserted, his
elaborate manner breaking down.&#160; "I was somewhere else to what
you think, so there!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It was good of you to come and explain,"
she said.&#160; "The rest is naturally no concern of ours."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, but I want--I wanted--have you ever
read <em>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel?</em>"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret nodded.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's a beautiful book.&#160; I wanted to
get back to the Earth, don't you see, like Richard does in the
end.&#160; Or have you ever read Stevenson's <em>Prince
Otto?</em>"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen and Tibby groaned gently.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's another beautiful book.&#160; You
get back to the Earth in that.&#160; I wanted--" He mouthed
affectedly.&#160; Then through the mists of his culture came a hard
fact, hard as a pebble.&#160; "I walked all the Saturday night,"
said Leonard.&#160; "I walked." A thrill of approval ran through
the sisters.&#160; But culture closed in again.&#160; He asked
whether they had ever read E. V. Lucas's <em>Open Road</em>.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Said Helen, "No doubt it's another
beautiful book, but I'd rather hear about your road."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, I walked."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How far?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't know, nor for how long.&#160; It
got too dark to see my watch."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Were you walking alone, may I ask?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes," he said, straightening himself; "but
we'd been talking it over at the office.&#160; There's been a lot
of talk at the office lately about these things.&#160; The fellows
there said one steers by the Pole Star, and I looked it up in the
celestial atlas, but once out of doors everything gets so
mixed--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Don't talk to me about the Pole Star,"
interrupted Helen, who was becoming interested.&#160; "I know its
little ways.&#160; It goes round and round, and you go round after
it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, I lost it entirely.&#160; First of
all the street lamps, then the trees, and towards morning it got
cloudy."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tibby, who preferred his comedy undiluted,
slipped from the room.&#160; He knew that this fellow would never
attain to poetry, and did not want to hear him trying.&#160;
Margaret and Helen remained.&#160; Their brother influenced them
more than they knew: in his absence they were stirred to enthusiasm
more easily.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Where did you start from?" cried
Margaret.&#160; "Do tell us more."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I took the Underground to Wimbledon.&#160;
As I came out of the office I said to myself, 'I must have a walk
once in a way.&#160; If I don't take this walk now, I shall never
take it.' I had a bit of dinner at Wimbledon, and then--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But not good country there, is it?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It was gas-lamps for hours.&#160; Still, I
had all the night, and being out was the great thing.&#160; I did
get into woods, too, presently."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, go on," said Helen.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You've no idea how difficult uneven ground
is when it's dark."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Did you actually go off the roads?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh yes.&#160; I always meant to go off the
roads, but the worst of it is that it's more difficult to find
one's way."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Mr. Bast, you're a born adventurer,"
laughed Margaret.&#160; "No professional athlete would have
attempted what you've done.&#160; It's a wonder your walk didn't
end in a broken neck.&#160; Whatever did your wife say?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Professional athletes never move without
lanterns and compasses," said Helen.&#160; "Besides, they can't
walk.&#160; It tires them.&#160; Go on."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I felt like R. L. S. You probably remember
how in <em>Virginibus</em>--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, but the wood.&#160; This 'ere
wood.&#160; How did you get out of it?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I managed one wood, and found a road the
other side which went a good bit uphill.&#160; I rather fancy it
was those North Downs, for the road went off into grass, and I got
into another wood.&#160; That was awful, with gorse bushes.&#160; I
did wish I'd never come, but suddenly it got light--just while I
seemed going under one tree.&#160; Then I found a road down to a
station, and took the first train I could back to London."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But was the dawn wonderful?" asked
Helen.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With unforgettable sincerity he replied,
"No." The word flew again like a pebble from the sling.&#160; Down
toppled all that had seemed ignoble or literary in his talk, down
toppled tiresome R. L. S. and the "love of the earth" and his silk
top-hat.&#160; In the presence of these women Leonard had arrived,
and he spoke with a flow, an exultation, that he had seldom
known.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The dawn was only grey, it was nothing to
mention--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Just a grey evening turned upside
down.&#160; I know."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"--and I was too tired to lift up my head
to look at it, and so cold too.&#160; I'm glad I did it, and yet at
the time it bored me more than I can say.&#160; And besides--you
can believe me or not as you choose--I was very hungry.&#160; That
dinner at Wimbledon--I meant it to last me all night like other
dinners.&#160; I never thought that walking would make such a
difference.&#160; Why, when you're walking you want, as it were, a
breakfast and luncheon and tea during the night as well, and I'd
nothing but a packet of Woodbines.&#160; Lord, I did feel
bad!&#160; Looking back, it wasn't what you may call
enjoyment.&#160; It was more a case of sticking to it.&#160; I did
stick.&#160; I--I was determined.&#160; Oh, hang it all!&#160;
what's the good--I mean, the good of living in a room for
ever?&#160; There one goes on day after day, same old game, same up
and down to town, until you forget there is any other game.&#160;
You ought to see once in a way what's going on outside, if it's
only nothing particular after all."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I should just think you ought," said
Helen, sitting on the edge of the table.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The sound of a lady's voice recalled him
from sincerity, and he said: "Curious it should all come about from
reading something of Richard Jefferies."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Excuse me, Mr. Bast, but you're wrong
there.&#160; It didn't.&#160; It came from something far
greater."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But she could not stop him.&#160; Borrow
was imminent after Jefferies--Borrow, Thoreau, and sorrow.&#160; R.
L. S. brought up the rear, and the outburst ended in a swamp of
books.&#160; No disrespect to these great names.&#160; The fault is
ours, not theirs.&#160; They mean us to use them for sign-posts,
and are not to blame if, in our weakness, we mistake the sign-post
for the destination.&#160; And Leonard had reached the
destination.&#160; He had visited the county of Surrey when
darkness covered its amenities, and its cosy villas had re-entered
ancient night.&#160; Every twelve hours this miracle happens, but
he had troubled to go and see for himself.&#160; Within his cramped
little mind dwelt something that was greater than Jefferies'
books--the spirit that led Jefferies to write them; and his dawn,
though revealing nothing but monotones, was part of the eternal
sunrise that shows George Borrow Stonehenge.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then you don't think I was foolish?" he
asked, becoming again the na&#239;ve and sweet-tempered boy for
whom Nature had intended him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Heavens, no!" replied Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Heaven help us if we do!" replied
Helen.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'm very glad you say that.&#160; Now, my
wife would never understand--not if I explained for days."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, it wasn't foolish!" cried Helen, her
eyes aflame.&#160; "You've pushed back the boundaries; I think it
splendid of you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You've not been content to dream as we
have--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Though we have walked, too--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I must show you a picture
upstairs--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Here the door-bell rang.&#160; The hansom
had come to take them to their evening party.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, bother, not to say dash--I had
forgotten we were dining out; but do, do, come round again and have
a talk."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, you must--do," echoed Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leonard, with extreme sentiment, replied:
"No, I shall not.&#160; It's better like this."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why better?" asked Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, it is better not to risk a second
interview.&#160; I shall always look back on this talk with you as
one of the finest things in my life.&#160; Really.&#160; I mean
this.&#160; We can never repeat.&#160; It has done me real good,
and there we had better leave it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's rather a sad view of life,
surely."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Things so often get spoiled."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I know," flashed Helen, "but people
don't."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He could not understand this.&#160; He
continued in a vein which mingled true imagination and false.&#160;
What he said wasn't wrong, but it wasn't right, and a false note
jarred.&#160; One little twist, they felt, and the instrument might
be in tune.&#160; One little strain, and it might be silent for
ever.&#160; He thanked the ladies very much, but he would not call
again.&#160; There was a moment's awkwardness, and then Helen said:
"Go, then; perhaps you know best; but never forget you're better
than Jefferies." And he went.&#160; Their hansom caught him up at
the corner, passed with a waving of hands, and vanished with its
accomplished load into the evening.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;London was beginning to illuminate herself
against the night.&#160; Electric lights sizzled and jagged in the
main thoroughfares, gas-lamps in the side streets glimmered a
canary gold or green.&#160; The sky was a crimson battlefield of
spring, but London was not afraid.&#160; Her smoke mitigated the
splendour, and the clouds down Oxford Street were a delicately
painted ceiling, which adorned while it did not distract.&#160; She
has never known the clear-cut armies of the purer air.&#160;
Leonard hurried through her tinted wonders, very much part of the
picture.&#160; His was a grey life, and to brighten it he had ruled
off a few corners for romance.&#160; The Miss Schlegels--or, to
speak more accurately, his interview with them--were to fill such a
corner, nor was it by any means the first time that he had talked
intimately to strangers.&#160; The habit was analogous to a
debauch, an outlet, though the worst of outlets, for instincts that
would not be denied.&#160; Terrifying him, it would beat down his
suspicions and prudence until he was confiding secrets to people
whom he had scarcely seen.&#160; It brought him many fears and some
pleasant memories.&#160; Perhaps the keenest happiness he had ever
known was during a railway journey to Cambridge, where a
decent-mannered undergraduate had spoken to him.&#160; They had got
into conversation, and gradually Leonard flung reticence aside,
told some of his domestic troubles, and hinted at the rest.&#160;
The undergraduate, supposing they could start a friendship, asked
him to "coffee after hall," which he accepted, but afterwards grew
shy, and took care not to stir from the commercial hotel where he
lodged.&#160; He did not want Romance to collide with the
Porphyrion, still less with Jacky, and people with fuller, happier
lives are slow to understand this.&#160; To the Schlegels, as to
the undergraduate, he was an interesting creature, of whom they
wanted to see more.&#160; But they to him were denizens of Romance,
who must keep to the corner he had assigned them, pictures that
must not walk out of their frames.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His behaviour over Margaret's visiting-card
had been typical.&#160; His had scarcely been a tragic
marriage.&#160; Where there is no money and no inclination to
violence tragedy cannot be generated.&#160; He could not leave his
wife, and he did not want to hit her.&#160; Petulance and squalor
were enough.&#160; Here "that card" had come in.&#160; Leonard,
though furtive, was untidy, and left it lying about.&#160; Jacky
found it, and then began, "What's that card, eh?"&#160; "Yes, don't
you wish you knew what that card was?"&#160; "Len, who's Miss
Schlegel?" etc.&#160; Months passed, and the card, now as a joke,
now as a grievance, was handed about, getting dirtier and
dirtier.&#160; It followed them when they moved from Cornelia Road
to Tulse Hill.&#160; It was submitted to third parties.&#160; A few
inches of pasteboard, it became the battlefield on which the souls
of Leonard and his wife contended.&#160; Why did he not say, "A
lady took my umbrella, another gave me this that I might call for
my umbrella"?&#160; Because Jacky would have disbelieved him?&#160;
Partly, but chiefly because he was sentimental.&#160; No affection
gathered round the card, but it symbolized the life of culture,
that Jacky should never spoil.&#160; At night he would say to
himself, "Well, at all events, she doesn't know about that
card.&#160; Yah!&#160; done her there!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Poor Jacky!&#160; she was not a bad sort,
and had a great deal to bear.&#160; She drew her own
conclusion--she was only capable of drawing one conclusion--and in
the fulness of time she acted upon it.&#160; All the Friday Leonard
had refused to speak to her, and had spent the evening observing
the stars.&#160; On the Saturday he went up, as usual, to town, but
he came not back Saturday night nor Sunday morning, nor Sunday
afternoon.&#160; The inconvenience grew intolerable, and though she
was now of a retiring habit, and shy of women, she went up to
Wickham Place.&#160; Leonard returned in her absence.&#160; The
card, the fatal card, was gone from the pages of Ruskin, and he
guessed what had happened.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well?" he had exclaimed, greeting her with
peals of laughter.&#160; "I know where you've been, but you don't
know where I've been.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Jacky sighed, said, "Len, I do think you
might explain," and resumed domesticity.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Explanations were difficult at this stage,
and Leonard was too silly--or it is tempting to write, too sound a
chap to attempt them.&#160; His reticence was not entirely the
shoddy article that a business life promotes, the reticence that
pretends that nothing is something, and hides behind the <em>Daily
Telegraph</em>.&#160; The adventurer, also, is reticent, and it is
an adventure for a clerk to walk for a few hours in darkness.&#160;
You may laugh at him, you who have slept nights on the veldt, with
your rifle beside you and all the atmosphere of adventure
past.&#160; And you also may laugh who think adventures
silly.&#160; But do not be surprised if Leonard is shy whenever he
meets you, and if the Schlegels rather than Jacky hear about the
dawn.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That the Schlegels had not thought him
foolish became a permanent joy.&#160; He was at his best when he
thought of them.&#160; It buoyed him as he journeyed home beneath
fading heavens.&#160; Somehow the barriers of wealth had fallen,
and there had been--he could not phrase it--a general assertion of
the wonder of the world.&#160; "My conviction," says the mystic,
"gains infinitely the moment another soul will believe in it," and
they had agreed that there was something beyond life's daily
grey.&#160; He took off his top-hat and smoothed it
thoughtfully.&#160; He had hitherto supposed the unknown to be
books, literature, clever conversation, culture.&#160; One raised
oneself by study, and got upsides with the world.&#160; But in that
quick interchange a new light dawned.&#160; Was that something"
walking in the dark among the surburban hills?&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He discovered that he was going bareheaded
down Regent Street.&#160; London came back with a rush.&#160; Few
were about at this hour, but all whom he passed looked at him with
a hostility that was the more impressive because it was
unconscious.&#160; He put his hat on.&#160; It was too big; his
head disappeared like a pudding into a basin, the ears bending
outwards at the touch of the curly brim.&#160; He wore it a little
backwards, and its effect was greatly to elongate the face and to
bring out the distance between the eyes and the moustache.&#160;
Thus equipped, he escaped criticism.&#160; No one felt uneasy as he
titupped along the pavements, the heart of a man ticking fast in
his chest.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 15</h3>
<p>The sisters went out to dinner full of their adventure, and when
they were both full of the same subject, there were few
dinner-parties that could stand up against them.&#160; This
particular one, which was all ladies, had more kick in it than
most, but succumbed after a struggle.&#160; Helen at one part of
the table, Margaret at the other, would talk of Mr. Bast and of no
one else, and somewhere about the entree their monologues collided,
fell ruining, and became common property.&#160; Nor was this
all.&#160; The dinner-party was really an informal discussion club;
there was a paper after it, read amid coffee-cups and laughter in
the drawing-room, but dealing more or less thoughtfully with some
topic of general interest.&#160; After the paper came a debate, and
in this debate Mr. Bast also figured, appearing now as a bright
spot in civilization, now as a dark spot, according to the
temperament of the speaker.&#160; The subject of the paper had
been, "How ought I to dispose of my money?" the reader professing
to be a millionaire on the point of death, inclined to bequeath her
fortune for the foundation of local art galleries, but open to
conviction from other sources.&#160; The various parts had been
assigned beforehand, and some of the speeches were amusing.&#160;
The hostess assumed the ungrateful role of "the millionaire's
eldest son," and implored her expiring parent not to dislocate
Society by allowing such vast sums to pass out of the family.&#160;
Money was the fruit of self-denial, and the second generation had a
right to profit by the self-denial of the first.&#160; What right
had "Mr. Bast" to profit?&#160; The National Gallery was good
enough for the likes of him.&#160; After property had had its
say--a saying that is necessarily ungracious--the various
philanthropists stepped forward.&#160; Something must be done for
"Mr. Bast": his conditions must be improved without impairing his
independence; he must have a free library, or free tennis-courts;
his rent must be paid in such a way that he did not know it was
being paid; it must be made worth his while to join the
Territorials; he must be forcibly parted from his uninspiring wife,
the money going to her as compensation; he must be assigned a Twin
Star, some member of the leisured classes who would watch over him
ceaselessly (groans from Helen); he must be given food but no
clothes, clothes but no food, a third-return ticket to Venice,
without either food or clothes when he arrived there.&#160; In
short, he might be given anything and everything so long as it was
not the money itself.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And here Margaret interrupted.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Order, order, Miss Schlegel!" said the
reader of the paper.&#160; "You are here, I understand, to advise
me in the interests of the Society for the Preservation of Places
of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty.&#160; I cannot have you
speaking out of your role.&#160; It makes my poor head go round,
and I think you forget that I am very ill."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Your head won't go round if only you'll
listen to my argument," said Margaret.&#160; "Why not give him the
money itself.&#160; You're supposed to have about thirty thousand a
year."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Have I?&#160; I thought I had a
million."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Wasn't a million your capital?&#160; Dear
me!&#160; we ought to have settled that.&#160; Still, it doesn't
matter.&#160; Whatever you've got, I order you to give as many poor
men as you can three hundred a year each.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But that would be pauperizing them," said
an earnest girl, who liked the Schlegels, but thought them a little
unspiritual at times.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not if you gave them so much.&#160; A big
windfall would not pauperize a man.&#160; It is these little
driblets, distributed among too many, that do the harm.&#160;
Money's educational.&#160; It's far more educational than the
things it buys." There was a protest.&#160; "In a sense," added
Margaret, but the protest continued.&#160; "Well, isn't the most
civilized thing going, the man who has learnt to wear his income
properly?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Exactly what your Mr. Basts won't
do."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Give them a chance.&#160; Give them
money.&#160; Don't dole them out poetry-books and railway-tickets
like babies.&#160; Give them the wherewithal to buy these
things.&#160; When your Socialism comes it may be different, and we
may think in terms of commodities instead of cash.&#160; Till it
comes give people cash, for it is the warp of civilization,
whatever the woof may be.&#160; The imagination ought to play upon
money and realize it vividly, for it's the--the second most
important thing in the world.&#160; It is so sluffed over and
hushed up, there is so little clear thinking--oh, political
economy, of course, but so few of us think clearly about our own
private incomes, and admit that independent thoughts are in nine
cases out of ten the result of independent means.&#160; Money: give
Mr. Bast money, and don't bother about his ideals.&#160; He'll pick
up those for himself."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She leant back while the more earnest
members of the club began to misconstrue her.&#160; The female
mind, though cruelly practical in daily life, cannot bear to hear
ideals belittled in conversation, and Miss Schlegel was asked
however she could say such dreadful things, and what it would
profit Mr. Bast if he gained the whole world and lost his own
soul.&#160; She answered, "Nothing, but he would not gain his soul
until he had gained a little of the world." Then they said, "No
they did not believe it," and she admitted that an overworked clerk
may save his soul in the superterrestrial sense, where the effort
will be taken for the deed, but she denied that he will ever
explore the spiritual resources of this world, will ever know the
rarer joys of the body, or attain to clear and passionate
intercourse with his fellows.&#160; Others had attacked the fabric
of Society-Property, Interest, etc.; she only fixed her eyes on a
few human beings, to see how, under present conditions, they could
be made happier.&#160; Doing good to humanity was useless: the
many-coloured efforts thereto spreading over the vast area like
films and resulting in an universal grey.&#160; To do good to one,
or, as in this case, to a few, was the utmost she dare hope
for.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Between the idealists, and the political
economists, Margaret had a bad time.&#160; Disagreeing elsewhere,
they agreed in disowning her, and in keeping the administration of
the millionaire's money in their own hands.&#160; The earnest girl
brought forward a scheme of "personal supervision and mutual help,"
the effect of which was to alter poor people until they became
exactly like people who were not so poor.&#160; The hostess
pertinently remarked that she, as eldest son, might surely rank
among the millionaire's legatees.&#160; Margaret weakly admitted
the claim, and another claim was at once set up by Helen, who
declared that she had been the millionaire's housemaid for over
forty years, overfed and underpaid; was nothing to be done for her,
so corpulent and poor?&#160; The millionaire then read out her last
will and testament, in which she left the whole of her fortune to
the Chancellor of the Exchequer.&#160; Then she died.&#160; The
serious parts of the discussion had been of higher merit than the
playful--in a men's debate is the reverse more general?&#160;--but
the meeting broke up hilariously enough, and a dozen happy ladies
dispersed to their homes.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen and Margaret walked the earnest girl
as far as Battersea Bridge Station, arguing copiously all the
way.&#160; When she had gone they were conscious of an alleviation,
and of the great beauty of the evening.&#160; They turned back
towards Oakley Street.&#160; The lamps and the plane-trees,
following the line of the embankment, struck a note of dignity that
is rare in English cities.&#160; The seats, almost deserted, were
here and there occupied by gentlefolk in evening dress, who had
strolled out from the houses behind to enjoy fresh air and the
whisper of the rising tide.&#160; There is something continental
about Chelsea Embankment.&#160; It is an open space used rightly, a
blessing more frequent in Germany than here.&#160; As Margaret and
Helen sat down, the city behind them seemed to be a vast theatre,
an opera-house in which some endless trilogy was performing, and
they themselves a pair of satisfied subscribers, who did not mind
losing a little of the second act.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Cold?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Tired?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Doesn't matter."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The earnest girl's train rumbled away over
the bridge.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I say, Helen--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Are we really going to follow up Mr.
Bast?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't know."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I think we won't."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"As you like."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's no good, I think, unless you really
mean to know people.&#160; The discussion brought that home to
me.&#160; We got on well enough with him in a spirit of excitement,
but think of rational intercourse.&#160; We mustn't play at
friendship.&#160; No, it's no good."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There's Mrs. Lanoline, too," Helen
yawned.&#160; "So dull."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Just so, and possibly worse than
dull."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I should like to know how he got hold of
your card."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But he said--something about a concert and
an umbrella--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then did the card see the wife--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Helen, come to bed."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, just a little longer, it is so
beautiful.&#160; Tell me; oh yes; did you say money is the warp of
the world?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then what's the woof?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Very much what one chooses," said
Margaret.&#160; "It's something that isn't money--one can't say
more."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Walking at night?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Probably."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"For Tibby, Oxford?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It seems so."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"For you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Now that we have to leave Wickham Place, I
begin to think it's that.&#160; For Mrs. Wilcox it was certainly
Howards End."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One's own name will carry immense
distances.&#160; Mr. Wilcox, who was sitting with friends many
seats away, heard his, rose to his feet, and strolled along towards
the speakers.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It is sad to suppose that places may ever
be more important than people," continued Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why, Meg?&#160; They're so much nicer
generally.&#160; I'd rather think of that forester's house in
Pomerania than of the fat Herr F&#246;rstmeister who lived in
it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I believe we shall come to care about
people less and less, Helen.&#160; The more people one knows the
easier it becomes to replace them.&#160; It's one of the curses of
London.&#160; I quite expect to end my life caring most for a
place."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Here Mr. Wilcox reached them.&#160; It was
several weeks since they had met.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How do you do?" he cried.&#160; "I thought
I recognized your voices.&#160; Whatever are you both doing down
here?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His tones were protective.&#160; He implied
that one ought not to sit out on Chelsea Embankment without a male
escort.&#160; Helen resented this, but Margaret accepted it as part
of the good man's equipment.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What an age it is since I've seen you, Mr.
Wilcox.&#160; I met Evie in the Tube, though, lately.&#160; I hope
you have good news of your son."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Paul?" said Mr. Wilcox, extinguishing his
cigarette, and sitting down between them.&#160; "Oh, Paul's all
right.&#160; We had a line from Madeira.&#160; He'll be at work
again by now."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ugh--" said Helen, shuddering from complex
causes.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I beg your pardon?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Isn't the climate of Nigeria too
horrible?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Someone's got to go," he said
simply.&#160; "England will never keep her trade overseas unless
she is prepared to make sacrifices.&#160; Unless we get firm in
West Africa, Ger--untold complications may follow.&#160; Now tell
me all your news."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, we've had a splendid evening," cried
Helen, who always woke up at the advent of a visitor.&#160; "We
belong to a kind of club that reads papers, Margaret and I--all
women, but there is a discussion after.&#160; This evening it was
on how one ought to leave one's money--whether to one's family, or
to the poor, and if so how--oh, most interesting."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The man of business smiled.&#160; Since his
wife's death he had almost doubled his income.&#160; He was an
important figure at last, a reassuring name on company
prospectuses, and life had treated him very well.&#160; The world
seemed in his grasp as he listened to the River Thames, which still
flowed inland from the sea.&#160; So wonderful to the girls, it
held no mysteries for him.&#160; He had helped to shorten its long
tidal trough by taking shares in the lock at Teddington, and if he
and other capitalists thought good, some day it could be shortened
again.&#160; With a good dinner inside him and an amiable but
academic woman on either flank, he felt that his hands were on all
the ropes of life, and that what he did not know could not be worth
knowing.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Sounds a most original entertainment!" he
exclaimed, and laughed in his pleasant way.&#160; "I wish Evie
would go to that sort of thing.&#160; But she hasn't the
time.&#160; She's taken to breed Aberdeen terriers--jolly little
dogs.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I expect we'd better be doing the same,
really."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We pretend we're improving ourselves, you
see," said Helen a little sharply, for the Wilcox glamour is not of
the kind that returns, and she had bitter memories of the days when
a speech such as he had just made would have impressed her
favourably.&#160; "We suppose it is a good thing to waste an
evening once a fortnight over a debate, but, as my sister says, it
may be better to breed dogs."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not at all.&#160; I don't agree with your
sister.&#160; There's nothing like a debate to teach one
quickness.&#160; I often wish I had gone in for them when I was a
youngster.&#160; It would have helped me no end."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Quickness--?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes.&#160; Quickness in argument.&#160;
Time after time I've missed scoring a point because the other man
has had the gift of the gab and I haven't.&#160; Oh, I believe in
these discussions."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The patronizing tone thought Margaret, came
well enough from a man who was old enough to be their father.&#160;
She had always maintained that Mr. Wilcox had a charm.&#160; In
times of sorrow or emotion his inadequacy had pained her, but it
was pleasant to listen to him now, and to watch his thick brown
moustache and high forehead confronting the stars.&#160; But Helen
was nettled.&#160; The aim of <em>their</em> debates she implied
was Truth.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh yes, it doesn't much matter what
subject you take," said he.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret laughed and said, "But this is
going to be far better than the debate itself." Helen recovered
herself and laughed too.&#160; "No, I won't go on," she
declared.&#160; "I'll just put our special case to Mr.
Wilcox."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"About Mr. Bast?&#160; Yes, do.&#160; He'll
be more lenient to a special case.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But, Mr. Wilcox, do first light another
cigarette.&#160; It's this.&#160; We've just come across a young
fellow, who's evidently very poor, and who seems interest--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What's his profession?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Clerk."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What in?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do you remember, Margaret?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh yes; the nice people who gave Aunt
Juley a new hearth-rug.&#160; He seems interesting, in some ways
very, and one wishes one could help him.&#160; He is married to a
wife whom he doesn't seem to care for much.&#160; He likes books,
and what one may roughly call adventure, and if he had a
chance--But he is so poor.&#160; He lives a life where all the
money is apt to go on nonsense and clothes.&#160; One is so afraid
that circumstances will be too strong for him and that he will
sink.&#160; Well, he got mixed up in our debate.&#160; He wasn't
the subject of it, but it seemed to bear on his point.&#160;
Suppose a millionaire died, and desired to leave money to help such
a man.&#160; How should he be helped?&#160; Should he be given
three hundred pounds a year direct, which was Margaret's
plan?&#160; Most of them thought this would pauperize him.&#160;
Should he and those like him be given free libraries?&#160; I said
'No!' He doesn't want more books to read, but to read books
rightly.&#160; My suggestion was he should be given something every
year towards a summer holiday, but then there is his wife, and they
said she would have to go too.&#160; Nothing seemed quite
right!&#160; Now what do you think?&#160; Imagine that you were a
millionaire, and wanted to help the poor.&#160; What would you
do?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Wilcox, whose fortune was not so very
far below the standard indicated, laughed exuberantly.&#160; "My
dear Miss Schlegel, I will not rush in where your sex has been
unable to tread.&#160; I will not add another plan to the numerous
excellent ones that have been already suggested.&#160; My only
contribution is this: let your young friend clear out of the
Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company with all possible speed."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why?" said Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He lowered his voice.&#160; "This is
between friends.&#160; It'll be in the Receiver's hands before
Christmas.&#160; It'll smash," he added, thinking that she had not
understood.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Dear me, Helen, listen to that.&#160; And
he'll have to get another place!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"<em>Will</em> have?&#160; Let him leave
the ship before it sinks.&#160; Let him get one now."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Rather than wait, to make sure?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Decidedly."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why's that?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Again the Olympian laugh, and the lowered
voice.&#160; "Naturally the man who's in a situation when he
applies stands a better chance, is in a stronger position, than the
man who isn't.&#160; It looks as if he's worth something.&#160; I
know by myself--(this is letting you into the State secrets)--it
affects an employer greatly.&#160; Human nature, I'm afraid."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I hadn't thought of that," murmured
Margaret, while Helen said, "Our human nature appears to be the
other way round.&#160; We employ people because they're
unemployed.&#160; The boot man, for instance."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And how does he clean the boots?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not well," confessed Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There you are!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then do you really advise us to tell this
youth--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I advise nothing," he interrupted,
glancing up and down the Embankment, in case his indiscretion had
been overheard.&#160; "I oughtn't to have spoken--but I happen to
know, being more or less behind the scenes.&#160; The Porphyrion's
a bad, bad concern--Now, don't say I said so.&#160; It's outside
the Tariff Ring."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Certainly I won't say.&#160; In fact, I
don't know what that means."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I thought an insurance company never
smashed," was Helen's contribution.&#160; "Don't the others always
run in and save them?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You're thinking of reinsurance," said Mr.
Wilcox mildly.&#160; "It is exactly there that the Porphyrion is
weak.&#160; It has tried to undercut, has been badly hit by a long
series of small fires, and it hasn't been able to reinsure.&#160;
I'm afraid that public companies don't save one another for
love."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"'Human nature,' I suppose," quoted Helen,
and he laughed and agreed that it was.&#160; When Margaret said
that she supposed that clerks, like every one else, found it
extremely difficult to get situations in these days, he replied,
"Yes, extremely," and rose to rejoin his friends.&#160; He knew by
his own office--seldom a vacant post, and hundreds of applicants
for it; at present no vacant post.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And how's Howards End looking?" said
Margaret, wishing to change the subject before they parted.&#160;
Mr. Wilcox was a little apt to think one wanted to get something
out of him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's let."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Really.&#160; And you wandering homeless
in long-haired Chelsea?&#160; How strange are the ways of
Fate!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No; it's let unfurnished.&#160; We've
moved."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why, I thought of you both as anchored
there for ever.&#160; Evie never told me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I dare say when you met Evie the thing
wasn't settled.&#160; We only moved a week ago.&#160; Paul has
rather a feeling for the old place, and we held on for him to have
his holiday there; but, really, it is impossibly small.&#160;
Endless drawbacks.&#160; I forget whether you've been up to
it?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"As far as the house, never."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, Howards End is one of those
converted farms.&#160; They don't really do, spend what you will on
them.&#160; We messed away with a garage all among the wych-elm
roots, and last year we enclosed a bit of the meadow and attempted
a mockery.&#160; Evie got rather keen on Alpine plants.&#160; But
it didn't do--no, it didn't do.&#160; You remember, or your sister
will remember, the farm with those abominable guinea-fowls, and the
hedge that the old woman never would cut properly, so that it all
went thin at the bottom.&#160; And, inside the house, the
beams--and the staircase through a door--picturesque enough, but
not a place to live in."&#160; He glanced over the parapet
cheerfully.&#160; "Full tide.&#160; And the position wasn't right
either.&#160; The neighbourhood's getting suburban.&#160; Either be
in London or out of it, I say; so we've taken a house in Ducie
Street, close to Sloane Street, and a place right down in
Shropshire--Oniton Grange.&#160; Ever heard of Oniton?&#160; Do
come and see us--right away from everywhere, up towards
Wales.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What a change!" said Margaret.&#160; But
the change was in her own voice, which had become most sad.&#160;
"I can't imagine Howards End or Hilton without you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Hilton isn't without us," he
replied.&#160; "Charles is there still."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Still?" said Margaret, who had not kept up
with the Charles'.&#160; "But I thought he was still at
Epsom.&#160; They were furnishing that Christmas--one
Christmas.&#160; How everything alters!&#160; I used to admire Mrs.
Charles from our windows very often.&#160; Wasn't it Epsom?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, but they moved eighteen months
ago.&#160; Charles, the good chap"--his voice dropped--"thought I
should be lonely.&#160; I didn't want him to move, but he would,
and took a house at the other end of Hilton, down by the Six
Hills.&#160; He had a motor, too.&#160; There they all are, a very
jolly party--he and she and the two grandchildren."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I manage other people's affairs so much
better than they manage them themselves," said Margaret as they
shook hands.&#160; "When you moved out of Howards End, I should
have moved Mr. Charles Wilcox into it.&#160; I should have kept so
remarkable a place in the family."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So it is," he replied.&#160; "I haven't
sold it, and don't mean to."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No; but none of you are there."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, we've got a splendid tenant--Hamar
Bryce, an invalid.&#160; If Charles ever wanted it--but he
won't.&#160; Dolly is so dependent on modern conveniences.&#160;
No, we have all decided against Howards End.&#160; We like it in a
way, but now we feel that it is neither one thing nor the
other.&#160; One must have one thing or the other."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And some people are lucky enough to have
both.&#160; You're doing yourself proud, Mr. Wilcox.&#160; My
congratulations."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And mine," said Helen.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do remind Evie to come and see us--two,
Wickham Place.&#160; We shan't be there very long, either."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You, too, on the move?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Next September," Margaret sighed.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Every one moving!&#160; Good-bye."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The tide had begun to ebb.&#160; Margaret
leant over the parapet and watched it sadly.&#160; Mr. Wilcox had
forgotten his wife, Helen her lover; she herself was probably
forgetting.&#160; Every one moving.&#160; Is it worth while
attempting the past when there is this continual flux even in the
hearts of men?&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen roused her by saying: "What a
prosperous vulgarian Mr. Wilcox has grown!&#160; I have very little
use for him in these days.&#160; However, he did tell us about the
Porphyrion.&#160; Let us write to Mr. Bast as soon as ever we get
home, and tell him to clear out of it at once."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do; yes, that's worth doing.&#160; Let
us."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Let's ask him to tea."</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 16</h3>
<p>Leonard accepted the invitation to tea next Saturday.&#160; But
he was right; the visit proved a conspicuous failure.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Sugar?" said Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Cake?" said Helen.&#160; "The big cake or
the little deadlies?&#160; I'm afraid you thought my letter rather
odd, but we'll explain--we aren't odd, really--not affected,
really.&#160; We're over-expressive: that's all.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a lady's lap-dog Leonard did not
excel.&#160; He was not an Italian, still less a Frenchman, in
whose blood there runs the very spirit of persiflage and of
gracious repartee.&#160; His wit was the Cockney's; it opened no
doors into imagination, and Helen was drawn up short by "The more a
lady has to say, the better," administered waggishly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, yes," she said.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ladies brighten--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, I know.&#160; The darlings are
regular sunbeams.&#160; Let me give you a plate."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How do you like your work?" interposed
Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He, too, was drawn up short.&#160; He would
not have these women prying into his work.&#160; They were Romance,
and so was the room to which he had at last penetrated, with the
queer sketches of people bathing upon its walls, and so were the
very tea-cups, with their delicate borders of wild
strawberries.&#160; But he would not let Romance interfere with his
life.&#160; There is the devil to pay then.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, well enough," he answered.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Your company is the Porphyrion, isn't
it?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, that's so"--becoming rather
offended.&#160; "It's funny how things get round."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why funny?" asked Helen, who did not
follow the workings of his mind.&#160; "It was written as large as
life on your card, and considering we wrote to you there, and that
you replied on the stamped paper--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Would you call the Porphyrion one of the
big Insurance Companies?" pursued Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It depends what you call big."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I mean by big, a solid, well-established
concern, that offers a reasonably good career to its
employ&#233;s."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I couldn't say--some would tell you one
thing and others another," said the employe uneasily.&#160; "For my
own part"--he shook his head--"I only believe half I hear.&#160;
Not that even; it's safer.&#160; Those clever ones come to the
worse grief, I've often noticed.&#160; Ah, you can't be too
careful."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He drank, and wiped his moustache, which
was going to be one of those moustaches that always droop into
tea-cups--more bother than they're worth, surely, and not
fashionable either.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I quite agree, and that's why I was
curious to know: is it a solid, well-established concern?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leonard had no idea.&#160; He understood
his own corner of the machine, but nothing beyond it.&#160; He
desired to confess neither knowledge nor ignorance, and under these
circumstances, another motion of the head seemed safest.&#160; To
him, as to the British public, the Porphyrion was the Porphyrion of
the advertisement--a giant, in the classical style, but draped
sufficiently, who held in one hand a burning torch, and pointed
with the other to St. Paul's and Windsor Castle.&#160; A large sum
of money was inscribed below, and you drew your own
conclusions.&#160; This giant caused Leonard to do arithmetic and
write letters, to explain the regulations to new clients, and
re-explain them to old ones.&#160; A giant was of an impulsive
morality--one knew that much.&#160; He would pay for Mrs. Munt's
hearth-rug with ostentatious haste, a large claim he would
repudiate quietly, and fight court by court.&#160; But his true
fighting weight, his antecedents, his amours with other members of
the commercial Pantheon--all these were as uncertain to ordinary
mortals as were the escapades of Zeus.&#160; While the gods are
powerful, we learn little about them.&#160; It is only in the days
of their decadence that a strong light beats into heaven.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We were told the Porphyrion's no go,"
blurted Helen.&#160; "We wanted to tell you; that's why we
wrote."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"A friend of ours did think that it is
unsufficiently reinsured," said Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now Leonard had his clue.&#160; He must
praise the Porphyrion.&#160; "You can tell your friend," he said,
"that he's quite wrong."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, good!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The young man coloured a little.&#160; In
his circle to be wrong was fatal.&#160; The Miss Schlegels did not
mind being wrong.&#160; They were genuinely glad that they had been
misinformed.&#160; To them nothing was fatal but evil.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Wrong, so to speak," he added.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How 'so to speak'?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I mean I wouldn't say he's right
altogether."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But this was a blunder.&#160; "Then he is
right partly," said the elder woman, quick as lightning.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leonard replied that every one was right
partly, if it came to that.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Mr. Bast, I don't understand business, and
I dare say my questions are stupid, but can you tell me what makes
a concern 'right' or 'wrong'?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leonard sat back with a sigh.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Our friend, who is also a business man,
was so positive.&#160; He said before Christmas--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And advised you to clear out of it,"
concluded Helen.&#160; "But I don't see why he should know better
than you do."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leonard rubbed his hands.&#160; He was
tempted to say that he knew nothing about the thing at all.&#160;
But a commercial training was too strong for him.&#160; Nor could
he say it was a bad thing, for this would be giving it away; nor
yet that it was good, for this would be giving it away
equally.&#160; He attempted to suggest that it was something
between the two, with vast possibilities in either direction, but
broke down under the gaze of four sincere eyes.&#160; As yet he
scarcely distinguished between the two sisters.&#160; One was more
beautiful and more lively, but "the Miss Schlegels" still remained
a composite Indian god, whose waving arms and contradictory
speeches were the product of a single mind.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"One can but see," he remarked, adding, "as
Ibsen says, 'things happen.'" He was itching to talk about books
and make the most of his romantic hour.&#160; Minute after minute
slipped away, while the ladies, with imperfect skill, discussed the
subject of reinsurance or praised their anonymous friend.&#160;
Leonard grew annoyed--perhaps rightly.&#160; He made vague remarks
about not being one of those who minded their affairs being talked
over by others, but they did not take the hint.&#160; Men might
have shown more tact.&#160; Women, however tactful elsewhere, are
heavy-handed here.&#160; They cannot see why we should shroud our
incomes and our prospects in a veil.&#160; "How much exactly have
you, and how much do you expect to have next June?"&#160; And these
were women with a theory, who held that reticence about money
matters is absurd, and that life would be truer if each would state
the exact size of the golden island upon which he stands, the exact
stretch of warp over which he throws the woof that is not
money.&#160; How can we do justice to the pattern
otherwise?&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And the precious minutes slipped away, and
Jacky and squalor came nearer.&#160; At last he could bear it no
longer, and broke in, reciting the names of books feverishly.&#160;
There was a moment of piercing joy when Margaret said, "So
<em>you</em> like Carlyle," and then the door opened, and "Mr.
Wilcox, Miss Wilcox" entered, preceded by two prancing
puppies.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, the dears!&#160; Oh, Evie, how too
impossibly sweet!" screamed Helen, falling on her hands and
knees.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We brought the little fellows round," said
Mr. Wilcox.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I bred 'em myself."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, really!&#160; Mr. Bast, come and play
with puppies."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I've got to be going now," said Leonard
sourly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But play with puppies a little
first."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"This is Ahab, that's Jezebel," said Evie,
who was one of those who name animals after the less successful
characters of Old Testament history.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I've got to be going."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen was too much occupied with puppies to
notice him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Mr. Wilcox, Mr. Ba--Must you be
really?&#160; Good-bye!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Come again," said Helen from the
floor.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then Leonard's gorge arose.&#160; Why
should he come again?&#160; What was the good of it?&#160; He said
roundly: "No, I shan't; I knew it would be a failure."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most people would have let him go.&#160; "A
little mistake.&#160; We tried knowing another
class--impossible."&#160; But the Schlegels had never played with
life.&#160; They had attempted friendship, and they would take the
consequences.&#160; Helen retorted, "I call that a very rude
remark.&#160; What do you want to turn on me like that for?" and
suddenly the drawing-room re-echoed to a vulgar row.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You ask me why I turn on you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What do you want to have me here
for?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"To help you, you silly boy!" cried
Helen.&#160; "And don't shout."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't want your patronage.&#160; I don't
want your tea.&#160; I was quite happy.&#160; What do you want to
unsettle me for?"&#160; He turned to Mr. Wilcox.&#160; "I put it to
this gentleman.&#160; I ask you, sir, am to have my brain
picked?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Wilcox turned to Margaret with the air
of humorous strength that he could so well command.&#160; "Are we
intruding, Miss Schlegel?&#160; Can we be of any use or shall we
go?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Margaret ignored him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'm connected with a leading insurance
company, sir.&#160; I receive what I take to be an invitation from
these--ladies" (he drawled the word).&#160; "I come, and it's to
have my brain picked.&#160; I ask you, is it fair?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Highly unfair," said Mr. Wilcox, drawing a
gasp from Evie, who knew that her father was becoming
dangerous.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There, you hear that?&#160; Most unfair,
the gentleman says.&#160; There!&#160; Not content with"--pointing
at Margaret--"you can't deny it." His voice rose: he was falling
into the rhythm of a scene with Jacky.&#160; "But as soon as I'm
useful it's a very different thing.&#160; 'Oh yes, send for
him.&#160; Cross-question him.&#160; Pick his brains.' Oh
yes.&#160; Now, take me on the whole, I'm a quiet fellow: I'm
law-abiding, I don't wish any unpleasantness; but I--I--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You," said Margaret--"you--you--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Laughter from Evie, as at a repartee.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You are the man who tried to walk by the
Pole Star."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More laughter.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You saw the sunrise."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Laughter.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You tried to get away from the fogs that
are stifling us all--away past books and houses to the truth.&#160;
You were looking for a real home.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I fail to see the connection," said
Leonard, hot with stupid anger.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So do I."&#160; There was a pause.&#160;
"You were that last Sunday--you are this today.&#160; Mr.
Bast!&#160; I and my sister have talked you over.&#160; We wanted
to help you; we also supposed you might help us.&#160; We did not
have you here out of charity--which bores us--but because we hoped
there would be a connection between last Sunday and other
days.&#160; What is the good of your stars and trees, your sunrise
and the wind, if they do not enter into our daily lives?&#160; They
have never entered into mine, but into yours, we thought--Haven't
we all to struggle against life's daily greyness, against
pettiness, against mechanical cheerfulness, against
suspicion?&#160; I struggle by remembering my friends; others I
have known by remembering some place--some beloved place or
tree--we thought you one of these."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Of course, if there's been any
misunderstanding," mumbled Leonard, "all I can do is to go.&#160;
But I beg to state--" He paused.&#160; Ahab and Jezebel danced at
his boots and made him look ridiculous.&#160; "You were picking my
brain for official information--I can prove it--I--He blew his nose
and left them.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Can I help you now?" said Mr. Wilcox,
turning to Margaret.&#160; "May I have one quiet word with him in
the hall?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Helen, go after him--do
anything--<em>anything</em>--to make the noodle understand."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen hesitated.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But really--" said their visitor.&#160;
"Ought she to?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At once she went.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He resumed.&#160; "I would have chimed in,
but I felt that you could polish him off for yourselves--I didn't
interfere.&#160; You were splendid, Miss Schlegel--absolutely
splendid.&#160; You can take my word for it, but there are very few
women who could have managed him."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh yes," said Margaret distractedly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Bowling him over with those long sentences
was what fetched me," cried Evie.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, indeed," chuckled her father; "all
that part about 'mechanical cheerfulness'--oh, fine!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'm very sorry," said Margaret, collecting
herself.&#160; "He's a nice creature really.&#160; I cannot think
what set him off.&#160; It has been most unpleasant for you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, <em>I</em> didn't mind."&#160; Then he
changed his mood.&#160; He asked if he might speak as an old
friend, and, permission given, said: "Oughtn't you really to be
more careful?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret laughed, though her thoughts still
strayed after Helen.&#160; "Do you realize that it's all your
fault?" she said.&#160; "You're responsible."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"This is the young man whom we were to warn
against the Porphyrion.&#160; We warn him, and--look!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Wilcox was annoyed.&#160; "I hardly
consider that a fair deduction," he said.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Obviously unfair," said Margaret.&#160; "I
was only thinking how tangled things are.&#160; It's our fault
mostly--neither yours nor his."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not his?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Miss Schlegel, you are too kind."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, indeed," nodded Evie, a little
contemptuously.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You behave much too well to people, and
then they impose on you.&#160; I know the world and that type of
man, and as soon as I entered the room I saw you had not been
treating him properly.&#160; You must keep that type at a
distance.&#160; Otherwise they forget themselves.&#160; Sad, but
true.&#160; They aren't our sort, and one must face the
fact."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ye-es."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do admit that we should never have had the
outburst if he was a gentleman."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I admit it willingly," said Margaret, who
was pacing up and down the room.&#160; "A gentleman would have kept
his suspicions to himself."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Wilcox watched her with a vague
uneasiness.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What did he suspect you of?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Of wanting to make money out of
him."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Intolerable brute!&#160; But how were you
to benefit?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Exactly.&#160; How indeed!&#160; Just
horrible, corroding suspicion.&#160; One touch of thought or of
goodwill would have brushed it away.&#160; Just the senseless fear
that does make men intolerable brutes."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I come back to my original point.&#160;
You ought to be more careful, Miss Schlegel.&#160; Your servants
ought to have orders not to let such people in."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She turned to him frankly.&#160; "Let me
explain exactly why we like this man, and want to see him
again."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's your clever way of thinking.&#160;
I shall never believe you like him."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I do.&#160; Firstly, because he cares for
physical adventure, just as you do.&#160; Yes, you go motoring and
shooting; he would like to go camping out.&#160; Secondly, he cares
for something special <em>in</em> adventure.&#160; It is quickest
to call that special something poetry--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, he's one of that writer sort."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No--oh no!&#160; I mean he may be, but it
would be loathsome stiff.&#160; His brain is filled with the husks
of books, culture--horrible; we want him to wash out his brain and
go to the real thing.&#160; We want to show him how he may get
upsides with life.&#160; As I said, either friends or the country,
some"--she hesitated--"either some very dear person or some very
dear place seems necessary to relieve life's daily grey, and to
show that it is grey.&#160; If possible, one should have
both."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some of her words ran past Mr.
Wilcox.&#160; He let them run past.&#160; Others he caught and
criticized with admirable lucidity.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Your mistake is this, and it is a very
common mistake.&#160; This young bounder has a life of his
own.&#160; What right have you to conclude it is an unsuccessful
life, or, as you call it, 'grey'?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Because--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"One minute.&#160; You know nothing about
him.&#160; He probably has his own joys and interests--wife,
children, snug little home.&#160; That's where we practical
fellows"--he smiled--"are more tolerant than you
intellectuals.&#160; We live and let live, and assume that things
are jogging on fairly well elsewhere, and that the ordinary plain
man may be trusted to look after his own affairs.&#160; I quite
grant--I look at the faces of the clerks in my own office, and
observe them to be dull, but I don't know what's going on
beneath.&#160; So, by the way, with London.&#160; I have heard you
rail against London, Miss Schlegel, and it seems a funny thing to
say but I was very angry with you.&#160; What do you know about
London?&#160; You only see civilization from the outside.&#160; I
don't say in your case, but in too many cases that attitude leads
to morbidity, discontent, and Socialism."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She admitted the strength of his position,
though it undermined imagination.&#160; As he spoke, some outposts
of poetry and perhaps of sympathy fell ruining, and she retreated
to what she called her "second line"--to the special facts of the
case.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"His wife is an old bore," she said
simply.&#160; "He never came home last Saturday night because he
wanted to be alone, and she thought he was with us."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"With <em>you?</em>"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes." Evie tittered.&#160; "He hasn't got
the cosy home that you assumed.&#160; He needs outside
interests."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Naughty young man!" cried the girl.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Naughty?" said Margaret, who hated
naughtiness more than sin.&#160; "When you're married, Miss Wilcox,
won't you want outside interests?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He has apparently got them," put in Mr.
Wilcox slyly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, indeed, Father."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He was tramping in Surrey, if you mean
that," said Margaret, pacing away rather crossly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, I dare say!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Miss Wilcox, he was!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"M-m-m-m!" from Mr. Wilcox, who thought the
episode amusing, if risqu&#233;.&#160; With most ladies he would
not have discussed it, but he was trading on Margaret's reputation
as an emanicipated woman.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He said so, and about such a thing he
wouldn't lie."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They both began to laugh.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's where I differ from you.&#160; Men
lie about their positions and prospects, but not about a thing of
that sort."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He shook his head.&#160; "Miss Schlegel,
excuse me, but I know the type."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I said before--he isn't a type.&#160; He
cares about adventures rightly.&#160; He's certain that our smug
existence isn't all.&#160; He's vulgar and hysterical and bookish,
but I don't think that sums him up.&#160; There's manhood in him as
well.&#160; Yes, that's what I'm trying to say.&#160; He's a real
man."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As she spoke their eyes met, and it was as
if Mr. Wilcox's defences fell.&#160; She saw back to the real man
in him.&#160; Unwittingly she had touched his emotions.&#160; A
woman and two men--they had formed the magic triangle of sex, and
the male was thrilled to jealousy, in case the female was attracted
by another male.&#160; Love, say the ascetics, reveals our shameful
kinship with the beasts.&#160; Be it so: one can bear that;
jealousy is the real shame.&#160; It is jealousy, not love, that
connects us with the farmyard intolerably, and calls up visions of
two angry cocks and a complacent hen.&#160; Margaret crushed
complacency down because she was civilized.&#160; Mr. Wilcox,
uncivilized, continued to feel anger long after he had rebuilt his
defences, and was again presenting a bastion to the world.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Miss Schlegel, you're a pair of dear
creatures, but you really <em>must</em> be careful in this
uncharitable world.&#160; What does your brother say?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I forget."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Surely he has some opinion?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He laughs, if I remember correctly."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He's very clever, isn't he?" said Evie,
who had met and detested Tibby at Oxford.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, pretty well--but I wonder what
Helen's doing."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She is very young to undertake this sort
of thing," said Mr. Wilcox.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret went out into the landing.&#160;
She heard no sound, and Mr. Bast's topper was missing from the
hall.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Helen!" she called.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes!" replied a voice from the
library.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You in there?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes--he's gone some time."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret went to her.&#160; "Why, you're
all alone," she said.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes--it's all right, Meg--Poor, poor
creature--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Come back to the Wilcoxes and tell me
later--Mr. W. much concerned, and slightly titillated."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, I've no patience with him.&#160; I
hate him.&#160; Poor dear Mr. Bast!&#160; he wanted to talk
literature, and we would talk business.&#160; Such a muddle of a
man, and yet so worth pulling through.&#160; I like him
extraordinarily.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well done," said Margaret, kissing her,
"but come into the drawing-room now, and don't talk about him to
the Wilcoxes.&#160; Make light of the whole thing."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen came and behaved with a cheerfulness
that reassured their visitor--this hen at all events was
fancy-free.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He's gone with my blessing," she cried,
"and now for puppies."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As they drove away, Mr. Wilcox said to his
daughter:<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I am really concerned at the way those
girls go on.&#160; They are as clever as you make 'em, but
unpractical--God bless me!&#160; One of these days they'll go too
far.&#160; Girls like that oughtn't to live alone in London.&#160;
Until they marry, they ought to have someone to look after
them.&#160; We must look in more often--we're better than no
one.&#160; You like them, don't you, Evie?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Evie replied: "Helen's right enough, but I
can't stand the toothy one.&#160; And I shouldn't have called
either of them girls."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Evie had grown up handsome.&#160;
Dark-eyed, with the glow of youth under sunburn, built firmly and
firm-lipped, she was the best the Wilcoxes could do in the way of
feminine beauty.&#160; For the present, puppies and her father were
the only things she loved, but the net of matrimony was being
prepared for her, and a few days later she was attracted to a Mr.
Percy Cahill, an uncle of Mrs. Charles, and he was attracted to
her.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 17</h3>
<p>The Age of Property holds bitter moments even for a
proprietor.&#160; When a move is imminent, furniture becomes
ridiculous, and Margaret now lay awake at nights wondering where,
where on earth they and all their belongings would be deposited in
September next.&#160; Chairs, tables, pictures, books, that had
rumbled down to them through the generations, must rumble forward
again like a slide of rubbish to which she longed to give the final
push, and send toppling into the sea.&#160; But there were all
their father's books--they never read them, but they were their
father's, and must be kept.&#160; There was the marble-topped
chiffonier--their mother had set store by it, they could not
remember why.&#160; Round every knob and cushion in the house
sentiment gathered, a sentiment that was at times personal, but
more often a faint piety to the dead, a prolongation of rites that
might have ended at the grave.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was absurd, if you came to think of it;
Helen and Tibby came to think of it: Margaret was too busy with the
house-agents.&#160; The feudal ownership of land did bring dignity,
whereas the modern ownership of movables is reducing us again to a
nomadic horde.&#160; We are reverting to the civilization of
luggage, and historians of the future will note how the middle
classes accreted possessions without taking root in the earth, and
may find in this the secret of their imaginative poverty.&#160; The
Schlegels were certainly the poorer for the loss of Wickham
Place.&#160; It had helped to balance their lives, and almost to
counsel them.&#160; Nor is their ground-landlord spiritually the
richer.&#160; He has built flats on its site, his motor-cars grow
swifter, his exposures of Socialism more trenchant.&#160; But he
has spilt the precious distillation of the years, and no chemistry
of his can give it back to society again.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret grew depressed; she was anxious to
settle on a house before they left town to pay their annual visit
to Mrs. Munt.&#160; She enjoyed this visit, and wanted to have her
mind at ease for it.&#160; Swanage, though dull, was stable, and
this year she longed more than usual for its fresh air and for the
magnificent downs that guard it on the north.&#160; But London
thwarted her; in its atmosphere she could not concentrate.&#160;
London only stimulates, it cannot sustain; and Margaret, hurrying
over its surface for a house without knowing what sort of a house
she wanted, was paying for many a thrilling sensation in the
past.&#160; She could not even break loose from culture, and her
time was wasted by concerts which it would be a sin to miss, and
invitations which it would never do to refuse.&#160; At last she
grew desperate; she resolved that she would go nowhere and be at
home to no one until she found a house, and broke the resolution in
half an hour.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once she had humorously lamented that she
had never been to Simpson's restaurant in the Strand.&#160; Now a
note arrived from Miss Wilcox, asking her to lunch there.&#160; Mr.
Cahill was coming, and the three would have such a jolly chat, and
perhaps end up at the Hippodrome.&#160; Margaret had no strong
regard for Evie, and no desire to meet her fianc&#233;, and she was
surprised that Helen, who had been far funnier about Simpson's, had
not been asked instead.&#160; But the invitation touched her by its
intimate tone.&#160; She must know Evie Wilcox better than she
supposed, and declaring that she "simply must," she accepted.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But when she saw Evie at the entrance of
the restaurant, staring fiercely at nothing after the fashion of
athletic women, her heart failed her anew.&#160; Miss Wilcox had
changed perceptibly since her engagement.&#160; Her voice was
gruffer, her manner more downright, and she was inclined to
patronize the more foolish virgin.&#160; Margaret was silly enough
to be pained at this.&#160; Depressed at her isolation, she saw not
only houses and furniture, but the vessel of life itself slipping
past her, with people like Evie and Mr. Cahill on board.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are moments when virtue and wisdom
fail us, and one of them came to her at Simpson's in the
Strand.&#160; As she trod the staircase, narrow, but carpeted
thickly, as she entered the eating-room, where saddles of mutton
were being trundled up to expectant clergymen, she had a strong, if
erroneous, conviction of her own futility, and wished she had never
come out of her backwater, where nothing happened except art and
literature, and where no one ever got married or succeeded in
remaining engaged.&#160; Then came a little surprise.&#160; "Father
might be of the party--yes, Father was." With a smile of pleasure
she moved forward to greet him, and her feeling of loneliness
vanished.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I thought I'd get round if I could," said
he.&#160; "Evie told me of her little plan, so I just slipped in
and secured a table.&#160; Always secure a table first.&#160; Evie,
don't pretend you want to sit by your old father, because you
don't.&#160; Miss Schlegel, come in my side, out of pity.&#160; My
goodness, but you look tired!&#160; Been worrying round after your
young clerks?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, after houses," said Margaret, edging
past him into the box.&#160; "I'm hungry, not tired; I want to eat
heaps."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's good.&#160; What'll you
have?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Fish pie," said she, with a glance at the
menu.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Fish pie!&#160; Fancy coming for fish pie
to Simpson's.&#160; It's not a bit the thing to go for
here.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Go for something for me, then," said
Margaret, pulling off her gloves.&#160; Her spirits were rising,
and his reference to Leonard Bast had warmed her curiously.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Saddle of mutton," said he after profound
reflection: "and cider to drink.&#160; That's the type of
thing.&#160; I like this place, for a joke, once in a way.&#160; It
is so thoroughly Old English.&#160; Don't you agree?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes," said Margaret, who didn't.&#160; The
order was given, the joint rolled up, and the carver, under Mr.
Wilcox's direction, cut the meat where it was succulent, and piled
their plates high.&#160; Mr. Cahill insisted on sirloin, but
admitted that he had made a mistake later on.&#160; He and Evie
soon fell into a conversation of the "No, I didn't; yes, you did"
type--conversation which, though fascinating to those who are
engaged in it, neither desires nor deserves the attention of
others.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's a golden rule to tip the
carver.&#160; Tip everywhere's my motto."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Perhaps it does make life more
human."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then the fellows know one again.&#160;
Especially in the East, if you tip, they remember you from year's
end to year's end.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Have you been in the East?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, Greece and the Levant.&#160; I used to
go out for sport and business to Cyprus; some military society of a
sort there.&#160; A few piastres, properly distributed, help to
keep one's memory green.&#160; But you, of course, think this
shockingly cynical.&#160; How's your discussion society getting
on?&#160; Any new Utopias lately?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, I'm house-hunting, Mr. Wilcox, as I've
already told you once.&#160; Do you know of any houses?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Afraid I don't."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, what's the point of being practical
if you can't find two distressed females a house?&#160; We merely
want a small house with large rooms, and plenty of them."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Evie, I like that!&#160; Miss Schlegel
expects me to turn house agent for her!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What's that, Father?&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I want a new home in September, and
someone must find it.&#160; I can't."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Percy, do you know of anything?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I can't say I do," said Mr. Cahill.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How like you!&#160; You're never any
good."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Never any good.&#160; Just listen to
her!&#160; Never any good.&#160; Oh, come!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, you aren't.&#160; Miss Schlegel, is
he?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The torrent of their love, having splashed
these drops at Margaret, swept away on its habitual course.&#160;
She sympathized with it now, for a little comfort had restored her
geniality.&#160; Speech and silence pleased her equally, and while
Mr. Wilcox made some preliminary inquiries about cheese, her eyes
surveyed the restaurant, and admired its well-calculated tributes
to the solidity of our past.&#160; Though no more Old English than
the works of Kipling, it had selected its reminiscences so adroitly
that her criticism was lulled, and the guests whom it was
nourishing for imperial purposes bore the outer semblance of Parson
Adams or Tom Jones.&#160; Scraps of their talk jarred oddly on the
ear.&#160; "Right you are!&#160; I'll cable out to Uganda this
evening," came from the table behind.&#160; "Their Emperor wants
war; well, let him have it," was the opinion of a clergyman.&#160;
She smiled at such incongruities.&#160; "Next time," she said to
Mr. Wilcox, "you shall come to lunch with me at Mr. Eustace
Miles's."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"With pleasure."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, you'd hate it," she said, pushing her
glass towards him for some more cider.&#160; "It's all proteids and
body-buildings, and people come up to you and beg your pardon, but
you have such a beautiful aura."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"A what?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Never heard of an aura?&#160; Oh, happy,
happy man!&#160; I scrub at mine for hours.&#160; Nor of an astral
plane?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He had heard of astral planes, and censured
them.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Just so.&#160; Luckily it was Helen's
aura, not mine, and she had to chaperone it and do the
politenesses.&#160; I just sat with my handkerchief in my mouth
till the man went."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Funny experiences seem to come to you two
girls.&#160; No one's ever asked me about my--what d'ye call
it?&#160; Perhaps I've not got one."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You're bound to have one, but it may be
such a terrible colour that no one dares mention it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Tell me, though, Miss Schlegel, do you
really believe in the supernatural and all that?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Too difficult a question."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why's that?&#160; Gruy&#232;re or
Stilton?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Gruy&#232;re, please."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Better have Stilton."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Stilton.&#160; Because, though I don't
believe in auras, and think Theosophy's only a
halfway-house--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"--Yet there may be something in it all the
same," he concluded, with a frown.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not even that.&#160; It may be halfway in
the wrong direction.&#160; I can't explain.&#160; I don't believe
in all these fads, and yet I don't like saying that I don't believe
in them."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He seemed unsatisfied, and said: "So you
wouldn't give me your word that you <em>don't</em> hold with astral
bodies and all the rest of it?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I could," said Margaret, surprised that
the point was of any importance to him.&#160; "Indeed, I
will.&#160; When I talked about scrubbing my aura, I was only
trying to be funny.&#160; But why do you want this settled?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't know."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Now, Mr. Wilcox, you do know."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, I am," "No, you're not," burst from
the lovers opposite.&#160; Margaret was silent for a moment, and
then changed the subject.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How's your house?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Much the same as when you honoured it last
week."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't mean Ducie Street.&#160; Howards
End, of course."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why 'of course'?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Can't you turn out your tenant and let it
to us?&#160; We're nearly demented."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Let me think.&#160; I wish I could help
you.&#160; But I thought you wanted to be in town.&#160; One bit of
advice: fix your district, then fix your price, and then don't
budge.&#160; That's how I got both Ducie Street and Oniton.&#160; I
said to myself, 'I mean to be exactly here,' and I was, and
Oniton's a place in a thousand."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But I do budge.&#160; Gentlemen seem to
mesmerize houses--cow them with an eye, and up they come,
trembling.&#160; Ladies can't.&#160; It's the houses that are
mesmerizing me.&#160; I've no control over the saucy things.&#160;
Houses are alive.&#160; No?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'm out of my depth," he said, and added:
"Didn't you talk rather like that to your office boy?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Did I?&#160;--I mean I did, more or
less.&#160; I talk the same way to every one--or try to."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, I know.&#160; And how much do you
suppose that he understood of it?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's his lookout.&#160; I don't believe
in suiting my conversation to my company.&#160; One can doubtless
hit upon some medium of exchange that seems to do well enough, but
it's no more like the real thing than money is like food.&#160;
There's no nourishment in it.&#160; You pass it to the lower
classes, and they pass it back to you, and this you call 'social
intercourse' or 'mutual endeavour,' when it's mutual priggishness
if it's anything.&#160; Our friends at Chelsea don't see
this.&#160; They say one ought to be at all costs intelligible, and
sacrifice--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Lower classes," interrupted Mr. Wilcox, as
it were thrusting his hand into her speech.&#160; "Well, you do
admit that there are rich and poor.&#160; That's something."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret could not reply.&#160; Was he
incredibly stupid, or did he understand her better than she
understood herself?&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You do admit that, if wealth was divided
up equally, in a few years there would be rich and poor again just
the same.&#160; The hard-working man would come to the top, the
wastrel sink to the bottom."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Every one admits that."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Your Socialists don't."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"My Socialists do.&#160; Yours mayn't; but
I strongly suspect yours of being not Socialists, but ninepins,
which you have constructed for your own amusement.&#160; I can't
imagine any living creature who would bowl over quite so
easily."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He would have resented this had she not
been a woman.&#160; But women may say anything--it was one of his
holiest beliefs--and he only retorted, with a gay smile: "I don't
care.&#160; You've made two damaging admissions, and I'm heartily
with you in both."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In time they finished lunch, and Margaret,
who had excused herself from the Hippodrome, took her leave.&#160;
Evie had scarcely addressed her, and she suspected that the
entertainment had been planned by the father.&#160; He and she were
advancing out of their respective families towards a more intimate
acquaintance.&#160; It had begun long ago.&#160; She had been his
wife's friend, and, as such, he had given her that silver
vinaigrette as a memento.&#160; It was pretty of him to have given
that vinaigrette, and he had always preferred her to Helen--unlike
most men.&#160; But the advance had been astonishing lately.&#160;
They had done more in a week than in two years, and were really
beginning to know each other.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She did not forget his promise to sample
Eustace Miles, and asked him as soon as she could secure Tibby as
his chaperon.&#160; He came, and partook of body-building dishes
with humility.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Next morning the Schlegels left for
Swanage.&#160; They had not succeeded in finding a new home.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 18</h3>
<p>As they were seated at Aunt Juley's breakfast-table at The Bays,
parrying her excessive hospitality and enjoying the view of the
bay, a letter came for Margaret and threw her into
perturbation.&#160; It was from Mr. Wilcox.&#160; It announced an
"important change" in his plans.&#160; Owing to Evie's marriage, he
had decided to give up his house in Ducie Street, and was willing
to let it on a yearly tenancy.&#160; It was a businesslike letter,
and stated frankly what he would do for them and what he would not
do.&#160; Also the rent.&#160; If they approved, Margaret was to
come up <em>at once</em>--the words were underlined, as is
necessary when dealing with women--and to go over the house with
him.&#160; If they disapproved, a wire would oblige, as he should
put it into the hands of an agent.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The letter perturbed, because she was not
sure what it meant.&#160; If he liked her, if he had manoeuvred to
get her to Simpson's, might this be a manoeuvre to get her to
London, and result in an offer of marriage?&#160; She put it to
herself as indelicately as possible, in the hope that her brain
would cry, "Rubbish, you're a self-conscious fool!"&#160; But her
brain only tingled a little and was silent, and for a time she sat
gazing at the mincing waves, and wondering whether the news would
seem strange to the others.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As soon as she began speaking, the sound of
her own voice reassured her.&#160; There could be nothing in
it.&#160; The replies also were typical, and in the buff of
conversation her fears vanished.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You needn't go though--" began her
hostess.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I needn't, but hadn't I better?&#160; It's
really getting rather serious.&#160; We let chance after chance
slip, and the end of it is we shall be bundled out bag and baggage
into the street.&#160; We don't know what we <em>want</em>, that's
the mischief with us--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, we have no real ties," said Helen,
helping herself to toast.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Shan't I go up to town today, take the
house if it's the least possible, and then come down by the
afternoon train tomorrow, and start enjoying myself.&#160; I shall
be no fun to myself or to others until this business is off my
mind."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But you won't do anything rash,
Margaret?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There's nothing rash to do."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Who <em>are</em> the Wilcoxes?" said
Tibby, a question that sounds silly, but was really extremely
subtle, as his aunt found to her cost when she tried to answer
it.&#160; "I don't <em>manage</em> the Wilcoxes; I don't see where
they come <em>in</em>."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No more do I," agreed Helen.&#160; "It's
funny that we just don't lose sight of them.&#160; Out of all our
hotel acquaintances, Mr. Wilcox is the only one who has
stuck.&#160; It is now over three years, and we have drifted away
from far more interesting people in that time.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Interesting people don't get one
houses."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Meg, if you start in your honest-English
vein, I shall throw the treacle at you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's a better vein than the cosmopolitan,"
said Margaret, getting up. "Now, children, which is it to be?&#160;
You know the Ducie Street house.&#160; Shall I say yes or shall I
say no?&#160; Tibby love--which?&#160; I'm specially anxious to pin
you both."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It all depends what meaning you attach to
the word 'possi--'"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It depends on nothing of the sort.&#160;
Say 'yes.'"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Say 'no.'"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then Margaret spoke rather seriously.&#160;
"I think," she said, "that our race is degenerating.&#160; We
cannot settle even this little thing; what will it be like when we
have to settle a big one?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It will be as easy as eating," returned
Helen.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I was thinking of Father.&#160; How could
he settle to leave Germany as he did, when he had fought for it as
a young man, and all his feelings and friends were Prussian?&#160;
How could he break loose with Patriotism and begin aiming at
something else?&#160; It would have killed me.&#160; When he was
nearly forty he could change countries and ideals--and we, at our
age, can't change houses.&#160; It's humiliating."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Your father may have been able to change
countries," said Mrs. Munt with asperity, "and that may or may not
be a good thing.&#160; But he could change houses no better than
you can, in fact, much worse.&#160; Never shall I forget what poor
Emily suffered in the move from Manchester."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I knew it," cried Helen.&#160; "I told you
so.&#160; It is the little things one bungles at.&#160; The big,
real ones are nothing when they come."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Bungle, my dear!&#160; You are too little
to recollect--in fact, you weren't there.&#160; But the furniture
was actually in the vans and on the move before the lease for
Wickham Place was signed, and Emily took train with baby--who was
Margaret then--and the smaller luggage for London, without so much
as knowing where her new home would be.&#160; Getting away from
that house may be hard, but it is nothing to the misery that we all
went through getting you into it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen, with her mouth full, cried: "And
that's the man who beat the Austrians, and the Danes, and the
French, and who beat the Germans that were inside himself.&#160;
And we're like him."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Speak for yourself," said Tibby.&#160;
"Remember that I am cosmopolitan, please."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Helen may be right."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Of course she's right," said Helen.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen might be right, but she did not go up
to London.&#160; Margaret did that.&#160; An interrupted holiday is
the worst of the minor worries, and one may be pardoned for feeling
morbid when a business letter snatches one away from the sea and
friends.&#160; She could not believe that her father had ever felt
the same.&#160; Her eyes had been troubling her lately, so that she
could not read in the train, and it bored her to look at the
landscape, which she had seen but yesterday.&#160; At Southampton
she "waved" to Frieda: Frieda was on her way down to join them at
Swanage, and Mrs. Munt had calculated that their trains would
cross.&#160; But Frieda was looking the other way, and Margaret
travelled on to town feeling solitary and old-maidish.&#160; How
like an old maid to fancy that Mr. Wilcox was courting her!&#160;
She had once visited a spinster--poor, silly, and
unattractive--whose mania it was that every man who approached her
fell in love.&#160; How Margaret's heart had bled for the deluded
thing!&#160; How she had lectured, reasoned, and in despair
acquiesced!&#160; "I may have been deceived by the curate, my dear,
but the young fellow who brings the midday post really is fond of
me, and has, as a matter fact--" It had always seemed to her the
most hideous corner of old age, yet she might be driven into it
herself by the mere pressure of virginity.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Wilcox met her at Waterloo
himself.&#160; She felt certain that he was not the same as usual;
for one thing, he took offence at everything she said.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"This is awfully kind of you," she began,
"but I'm afraid it's not going to do.&#160; The house has not been
built that suits the Schlegel family."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What!&#160; Have you come up determined
not to deal?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not exactly."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not exactly?&#160; In that case let's be
starting."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She lingered to admire the motor, which was
new and a fairer creature than the vermilion giant that had borne
Aunt Juley to her doom three years before.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Presumably it's very beautiful," she
said.&#160; "How do you like it, Crane?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Come, let's be starting," repeated her
host.&#160; "How on earth did you know that my chauffeur was called
Crane?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why, I know Crane: I've been for a drive
with Evie once.&#160; I know that you've got a parlourmaid called
Milton.&#160; I know all sorts of things."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Evie!" he echoed in injured tones.&#160;
"You won't see her.&#160; She's gone out with Cahill.&#160; It's no
fun, I can tell you, being left so much alone.&#160; I've got my
work all day--indeed, a great deal too much of it--but when I come
home in the evening, I tell you, I can't stand the house."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In my absurd way, I'm lonely too,"
Margaret replied.&#160; "It's heart-breaking to leave one's old
home.&#160; I scarcely remember anything before Wickham Place, and
Helen and Tibby were born there.&#160; Helen says--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You, too, feel lonely?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Horribly.&#160; Hullo, Parliament's
back!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Wilcox glanced at Parliament
contemptuously.&#160; The more important ropes of life lay
elsewhere.&#160; "Yes, they are talking again." said he. "But you
were going to say--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Only some rubbish about furniture.&#160;
Helen says it alone endures while men and houses perish, and that
in the end the world will be a desert of chairs and sofas--just
imagine it!&#160;--rolling through infinity with no one to sit upon
them."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Your sister always likes her little
joke.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She says 'Yes,' my brother says 'No,' to
Ducie Street.&#160; It's no fun helping us, Mr. Wilcox, I assure
you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You are not as unpractical as you
pretend.&#160; I shall never believe it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret laughed.&#160; But she was--quite
as unpractical.&#160; She could not concentrate on details.&#160;
Parliament, the Thames, the irresponsive chauffeur, would flash
into the field of house-hunting, and all demand some comment or
response.&#160; It is impossible to see modern life steadily and
see it whole, and she had chosen to see it whole.&#160; Mr. Wilcox
saw steadily.&#160; He never bothered over the mysterious or the
private.&#160; The Thames might run inland from the sea, the
chauffeur might conceal all passion and philosophy beneath his
unhealthy skin.&#160; They knew their own business, and he knew
his.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet she liked being with him.&#160; He was
not a rebuke, but a stimulus, and banished morbidity.&#160; Some
twenty years her senior, he preserved a gift that she supposed
herself to have already lost--not youth's creative power, but its
self-confidence and optimism.&#160; He was so sure that it was a
very pleasant world.&#160; His complexion was robust, his hair had
receded but not thinned, the thick moustache and the eyes that
Helen had compared to brandy-balls had an agreeable menace in them,
whether they were turned towards the slums or towards the
stars.&#160; Some day--in the millennium--there may be no need for
his type.&#160; At present, homage is due to it from those who
think themselves superior, and who possibly are."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"At all events you responded to my telegram
promptly," he remarked.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, even I know a good thing when I see
it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'm glad you don't despise the goods of
this world."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Heavens, no!&#160; Only idiots and prigs
do that."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I am glad, very glad," he repeated,
suddenly softening and turning to her, as if the remark had pleased
him.&#160; "There is so much cant talked in would-be intellectual
circles.&#160; I am glad you don't share it.&#160; Self-denial is
all very well as a means of strengthening the character.&#160; But
I can't stand those people who run down comforts.&#160; They have
usually some axe to grind.&#160; Can you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Comforts are of two kinds," said Margaret,
who was keeping herself in hand--"those we can share with others,
like fire, weather, or music; and those we can't--food, for
instance.&#160; It depends."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I mean reasonable comforts, of
course.&#160; I shouldn't like to think that you--" He bent nearer;
the sentence died unfinished.&#160; Margaret's head turned very
stupid, and the inside of it seemed to revolve like the beacon in a
lighthouse.&#160; He did not kiss her, for the hour was half-past
twelve, and the car was passing by the stables of Buckingham
Palace.&#160; But the atmosphere was so charged with emotion that
people only seemed to exist on her account, and she was surprised
that Crane did not realize this, and turn round.&#160; Idiot though
she might be, surely Mr. Wilcox was more--how should one put
it?&#160;--more psychological than usual.&#160; Always a good judge
of character for business purposes, he seemed this afternoon to
enlarge his field, and to note qualities outside neatness,
obedience, and decision.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I want to go over the whole house," she
announced when they arrived.&#160; "As soon as I get back to
Swanage, which will be tomorrow afternoon, I'll talk it over once
more with Helen and Tibby, and wire you 'yes' or 'no.'"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Right.&#160; The dining-room." And they
began their survey.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The dining-room was big, but
over-furnished.&#160; Chelsea would have moaned aloud.&#160; Mr.
Wilcox had eschewed those decorative schemes that wince, and
relent, and refrain, and achieve beauty by sacrificing comfort and
pluck.&#160; After so much self-colour and self-denial, Margaret
viewed with relief the sumptuous dado, the frieze, the gilded
wall-paper, amid whose foliage parrots sang.&#160; It would never
do with her own furniture, but those heavy chairs, that immense
side-board loaded with presentation plate, stood up against its
pressure like men.&#160; The room suggested men, and Margaret, keen
to derive the modern capitalist from the warriors and hunters of
the past, saw it as an ancient guest-hall, where the lord sat at
meat among his thanes.&#160; Even the Bible--the Dutch Bible that
Charles had brought back from the Boer War--fell into
position.&#160; Such a room admitted loot.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Now the entrance-hall."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The entrance-hall was paved.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Here we fellows smoke."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We fellows smoked in chairs of maroon
leather.&#160; It was as if a motor-car had spawned.&#160; "Oh,
jolly!" said Margaret, sinking into one of them.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You do like it?" he said, fixing his eyes
on her upturned face, and surely betraying an almost intimate
note.&#160; "It's all rubbish not making oneself comfortable.&#160;
Isn't it?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ye-es.&#160; Semi-rubbish.&#160; Are those
Cruikshanks?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Gillrays.&#160; Shall we go on
upstairs?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Does all this furniture come from Howards
End?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The Howards End furniture has all gone to
Oniton."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Does--However, I'm concerned with the
house, not the furniture.&#160; How big is this
smoking-room?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Thirty by fifteen.&#160; No, wait a
minute.&#160; Fifteen and a half?."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ah, well.&#160; Mr. Wilcox, aren't you
ever amused at the solemnity with which we middle classes approach
the subject of houses?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They proceeded to the drawing-room.&#160;
Chelsea managed better here.&#160; It was sallow and
ineffective.&#160; One could visualize the ladies withdrawing to
it, while their lords discussed life's realities below, to the
accompaniment of cigars.&#160; Had Mrs. Wilcox's drawing-room
looked thus at Howards End?&#160; Just as this thought entered
Margaret's brain, Mr. Wilcox did ask her to be his wife, and the
knowledge that she had been right so overcame her that she nearly
fainted.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the proposal was not to rank among the
world's great love scenes.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Miss Schlegel"--his voice was firm--"I
have had you up on false pretences.&#160; I want to speak about a
much more serious matter than a house."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret almost answered: "I know--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Could you be induced to share my--is it
probable--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, Mr. Wilcox!" she interrupted, holding
the piano and averting her eyes.&#160; "I see, I see.&#160; I will
write to you afterwards if I may."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He began to stammer.&#160; "Miss
Schlegel--Margaret--you don't understand."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh yes!&#160; Indeed, yes!" said
Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I am asking you to be my wife."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So deep already was her sympathy, that when
he said, "I am asking you to be my wife," she made herself give a
little start.&#160; She must show surprise if he expected it.&#160;
An immense joy came over her.&#160; It was indescribable.&#160; It
had nothing to do with humanity, and most resembled the
all-pervading happiness of fine weather.&#160; Fine weather is due
to the sun, but Margaret could think of no central radiance
here.&#160; She stood in his drawing-room happy, and longing to
give happiness.&#160; On leaving him she realized that the central
radiance had been love.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You aren't offended, Miss Schlegel?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How could I be offended?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There was a moment's pause.&#160; He was
anxious to get rid of her, and she knew it.&#160; She had too much
intuition to look at him as he struggled for possessions that money
cannot buy.&#160; He desired comradeship and affection, but he
feared them, and she, who had taught herself only to desire, and
could have clothed the struggle with beauty, held back, and
hesitated with him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Good-bye," she continued.&#160; "You will
have a letter from me--I am going back to Swanage tomorrow.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Thank you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Good-bye, and it's you I thank."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I may order the motor round, mayn't
I?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That would be most kind."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I wish I had written instead.&#160; Ought
I to have written?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not at all."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There's just one question--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She shook her head.&#160; He looked a
little bewildered, and they parted.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They parted without shaking hands: she had
kept the interview, for his sake, in tints of the quietest
grey.&#160; Yet she thrilled with happiness ere she reached her own
house.&#160; Others had loved her in the past, if one may apply to
their brief desires so grave a word, but those others had been
"ninnies"--young men who had nothing to do, old men who could find
nobody better.&#160; And she had often "loved," too, but only so
far as the facts of sex demanded: mere yearnings for the masculine,
to be dismissed for what they were worth, with a smile.&#160; Never
before had her personality been touched.&#160; She was not young or
very rich, and it amazed her that a man of any standing should take
her seriously.&#160; As she sat trying to do accounts in her empty
house, amidst beautiful pictures and noble books, waves of emotion
broke, as if a tide of passion was flowing through the night
air.&#160; She shook her head, tried to concentrate her attention,
and failed.&#160; In vain did she repeat: "But I've been through
this sort of thing before." She had never been through it; the big
machinery, as opposed to the little, had been set in motion, and
the idea that Mr. Wilcox loved, obsessed her before she came to
love him in return.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She would come to no decision yet.&#160;
"Oh, sir, this is so sudden"--that prudish phrase exactly expressed
her when her time came.&#160; Premonitions are not
preparation.&#160; She must examine more closely her own nature and
his; she must talk it over judicially with Helen.&#160; It had been
a strange love-scene--the central radiance unacknowledged from
first to last.&#160; She, in his place, would have said "Ich liebe
dich," but perhaps it was not his habit to open the heart.&#160; He
might have done it if she had pressed him--as a matter of duty,
perhaps; England expects every man to open his heart once; but the
effort would have jarred him, and never, if she could avoid it,
should he lose those defences that he had chosen to raise against
the world.&#160; He must never be bothered with emotional talk, or
with a display of sympathy.&#160; He was an elderly man now, and it
would be futile and impudent to correct him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Wilcox strayed in and out, ever a
welcome ghost; surveying the scene, thought Margaret, without one
hint of bitterness.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 19</h3>
<p>If one wanted to show a foreigner England, perhaps the wisest
course would be to take him to the final section of the Purbeck
Hills, and stand him on their summit, a few miles to the east of
Corfe.&#160; Then system after system of our island would roll
together under his feet.&#160; Beneath him is the valley of the
Frome, and all the wild lands that come tossing down from
Dorchester, black and gold, to mirror their gorse in the expanses
of Poole.&#160; The valley of the Stour is beyond, unaccountable
stream, dirty at Blandford, pure at Wimborne--the Stour, sliding
out of fat fields, to marry the Avon beneath the tower of
Christchurch.&#160; The valley of the Avon--invisible, but far to
the north the trained eye may see Clearbury Ring that guards it,
and the imagination may leap beyond that on to Salisbury Plain
itself, and beyond the Plain to all the glorious downs of Central
England.&#160; Nor is Suburbia absent.&#160; Bournemouth's ignoble
coast cowers to the right, heralding the pine-trees that mean, for
all their beauty, red houses, and the Stock Exchange, and extend to
the gates of London itself.&#160; So tremendous is the City's
trail!&#160; But the cliffs of Freshwater it shall never touch, and
the island will guard the Island's purity till the end of
time.&#160; Seen from the west, the Wight is beautiful beyond all
laws of beauty.&#160; It is as if a fragment of England floated
forward to greet the foreigner--chalk of our chalk, turf of our
turf, epitome of what will follow.&#160; And behind the fragment
lies Southampton, hostess to the nations, and Portsmouth, a latent
fire, and all around it, with double and treble collision of tides,
swirls the sea.&#160; How many villages appear in this view!&#160;
How many castles!&#160; How many churches, vanished or
triumphant!&#160; How many ships, railways, and roads!&#160; What
incredible variety of men working beneath that lucent sky to what
final end!&#160; The reason fails, like a wave on the Swanage
beach; the imagination swells, spreads, and deepens, until it
becomes geographic and encircles England.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So Frieda Mosebach, now Frau Architect
Liesecke, and mother to her husband's baby, was brought up to these
heights to be impressed, and, after a prolonged gaze, she said that
the hills were more swelling here than in Pomerania, which was
true, but did not seem to Mrs. Munt apposite.&#160; Poole Harbour
was dry, which led her to praise the absence of muddy foreshore at
Friedrich Wilhelms Bad, R&#252;gen, where beech-trees hang over the
tideless Baltic, and cows may contemplate the brine.&#160; Rather
unhealthy Mrs. Munt thought this would be, water being safer when
it moved about.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And your English lakes--Vindermere,
Grasmere--are they, then, unhealthy?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, Frau Liesecke; but that is because
they are fresh water, and different.&#160; Salt water ought to have
tides, and go up and down a great deal, or else it smells.&#160;
Look, for instance, at an aquarium."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"An aquarium!&#160; Oh, <em>Meesis</em>
Munt, you mean to tell me that fresh aquariums stink less than
salt?&#160; Why, when Victor, my brother-in-law, collected many
tadpoles--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You are not to say 'stink,'" interrupted
Helen; "at least, you may say it, but you must pretend you are
being funny while you say it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then 'smell.' And the mud of your Pool
down there--does it not smell, or may I say 'stink, ha, ha'?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There always has been mud in Poole
Harbour," said Mrs. Munt, with a slight frown.&#160; "The rivers
bring it down, and a most valuable oyster-fishery depends upon
it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, that is so," conceded Frieda; and
another international incident was closed.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"'Bournemouth is,'" resumed their hostess,
quoting a local rhyme to which she was much attached--"
'Bournemouth is, Poole was, and Swanage is to be the most important
town of all and biggest of the three.' Now, Frau Liesecke, I have
shown you Bournemouth, and I have shown you Poole, so let us walk
backward a little, and look down again at Swanage."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Aunt Juley, wouldn't that be Meg's
train?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A tiny puff of smoke had been circling the
harbour, and now was bearing southwards towards them over the black
and the gold.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, dearest Margaret, I do hope she won't
be overtired."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, I do wonder--I do wonder whether she's
taken the house."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I hope she hasn't been hasty."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So do I--oh, so do I."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Will it be as beautiful as Wickham Place?"
Frieda asked.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I should think it would.&#160; Trust Mr.
Wilcox for doing himself proud.&#160; All those Ducie Street houses
are beautiful in their modern way, and I can't think why he doesn't
keep on with it.&#160; But it's really for Evie that he went there,
and now that Evie's going to be married--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ah!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You've never seen Miss Wilcox,
Frieda.&#160; How absurdly matrimonial you are!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But sister to that Paul?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And to that Charles," said Mrs. Munt with
feeling.&#160; "Oh, Helen, Helen, what a time that was!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen laughed.&#160; "Meg and I haven't got
such tender hearts.&#160; If there's a chance of a cheap house, we
go for it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Now look, Frau Liesecke, at my niece's
train.&#160; You see, it is coming towards us--coming, coming; and,
when it gets to Corfe, it will actually go <em>through</em> the
downs, on which we are standing, so that, if we walk over, as I
suggested, and look down on Swanage, we shall see it coming on the
other side.&#160; Shall we?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Frieda assented, and in a few minutes they
had crossed the ridge and exchanged the greater view for the
lesser.&#160; Rather a dull valley lay below, backed by the slope
of the coastward downs.&#160; They were looking across the Isle of
Purbeck and on to Swanage, soon to be the most important town of
all, and ugliest of the three.&#160; Margaret's train reappeared as
promised, and was greeted with approval by her aunt.&#160; It came
to a standstill in the middle distance, and there it had been
planned that Tibby should meet her, and drive her, and a
tea-basket, up to join them.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You see," continued Helen to her cousin,
"the Wilcoxes collect houses as your Victor collects
tadpoles.&#160; They have, one, Ducie Street; two, Howards End,
where my great rumpus was; three, a country seat in Shropshire;
four, Charles has a house in Hilton; and five, another near Epsom;
and six, Evie will have a house when she marries, and probably a
pied-&#224;-terre in the country--which makes seven.&#160; Oh yes,
and Paul a hut in Africa makes eight.&#160; I wish we could get
Howards End.&#160; That was something like a dear little
house!&#160; Didn't you think so, Aunt Juley?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;" I had too much to do, dear, to look at
it," said Mrs. Munt, with a gracious dignity.&#160; "I had
everything to settle and explain, and Charles Wilcox to keep in his
place besides.&#160; It isn't likely I should remember much.&#160;
I just remember having lunch in your bedroom."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes so do I.&#160; But, oh dear, dear, how
dead it all seems!&#160; And in the autumn there began this
anti-Pauline movement--you, and Frieda, and Meg, and Mrs. Wilcox,
all obsessed with the idea that I might yet marry Paul."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You yet may," said Frieda
despondently.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen shook her head.&#160; "The Great
Wilcox Peril will never return.&#160; If I'm certain of anything
it's of that."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"One is certain of nothing but the truth of
one's own emotions."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The remark fell damply on the
conversation.&#160; But Helen slipped her arm round her cousin,
somehow liking her the better for making it.&#160; It was not an
original remark, nor had Frieda appropriated it passionately, for
she had a patriotic rather than a philosophic mind.&#160; Yet it
betrayed that interest in the universal which the average Teuton
possesses and the average Englishman does not.&#160; It was,
however illogically, the good, the beautiful, the true, as opposed
to the respectable, the pretty, the adequate.&#160; It was a
landscape of B&#246;cklin's beside a landscape of Leader's,
strident and ill-considered, but quivering into supernatural
life.&#160; It sharpened idealism, stirred the soul.&#160; It may
have been a bad preparation for what followed.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Look!" cried Aunt Juley, hurrying away
from generalities over the narrow summit of the down.&#160; "Stand
where I stand, and you will see the pony-cart coming.&#160; I see
the pony-cart coming."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They stood and saw the pony-cart
coming.&#160; Margaret and Tibby were presently seen coming in
it.&#160; Leaving the outskirts of Swanage, it drove for a little
through the budding lanes, and then began the ascent.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Have you got the house?" they shouted,
long before she could possibly hear.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen ran down to meet her.&#160; The
highroad passed over a saddle, and a track went thence at right
angles along the ridge of the down.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Have you got the house?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret shook her head.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, what a nuisance!&#160; So we're as we
were?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not exactly."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She got out, looking tired.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Some mystery," said Tibby.&#160; "We are
to be enlightened presently."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret came close up to her and whispered
that she had had a proposal of marriage from Mr. Wilcox.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen was amused.&#160; She opened the gate
on to the downs so that her brother might lead the pony
through.&#160; "It's just like a widower," she remarked.&#160;
"They've cheek enough for anything, and invariably select one of
their first wife's friends."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret's face flashed despair.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That type--" She broke off with a
cry.&#160; "Meg, not anything wrong with you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Wait one minute," said Margaret,
whispering always.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But you've never conceivably--you've
never--" She pulled herself together.&#160; "Tibby, hurry up
through; I can't hold this gate indefinitely.&#160; Aunt
Juley!&#160; I say, Aunt Juley, make the tea, will you, and Frieda;
we've got to talk houses, and I'll come on afterwards." And then,
turning her face to her sister's, she burst into tears.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret was stupefied.&#160; She heard
herself saying, "Oh, really--"&#160; She felt herself touched with
a hand that trembled.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Don't," sobbed Helen, "don't, don't, Meg,
don't!"&#160; She seemed incapable of saying any other word.&#160;
Margaret, trembling herself, led her forward up the road, till they
strayed through another gate on to the down.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Don't, don't do such a thing!&#160; I tell
you not to--don't!&#160; I know--don't!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What do you know?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Panic and emptiness," sobbed Helen.&#160;
"Don't!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then Margaret thought, "Helen is a little
selfish.&#160; I have never behaved like this when there has seemed
a chance of her marrying.&#160; She said: "But we would still see
each other very often, and--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's not a thing like that," sobbed
Helen.&#160; And she broke right away and wandered distractedly
upwards, stretching her hands towards the view and crying.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What's happened to you?" called Margaret,
following through the wind that gathers at sundown on the northern
slopes of hills.&#160; "But it's stupid!"&#160; And suddenly
stupidity seized her, and the immense landscape was blurred.&#160;
But Helen turned back.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;" Meg--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't know what's happened to either of
us," said Margaret, wiping her eyes.&#160; "We must both have gone
mad."&#160; Then Helen wiped hers, and they even laughed a
little.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Look here, sit down."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"All right; I'll sit down if you'll sit
down."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There. (One kiss.) Now, whatever, whatever
is the matter?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I do mean what I said.&#160; Don't; it
wouldn't do."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, Helen, stop saying 'don't'!&#160; It's
ignorant.&#160; It's as if your head wasn't out of the slime.&#160;
'Don't' is probably what Mrs. Bast says all the day to Mr.
Bast."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen was silent.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Tell me about it first, and meanwhile
perhaps I'll have got my head out of the slime."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's better.&#160; Well, where shall I
begin?&#160; When I arrived at Waterloo--no, I'll go back before
that, because I'm anxious you should know everything from the
first.&#160; The 'first' was about ten days ago.&#160; It was the
day Mr. Bast came to tea and lost his temper.&#160; I was defending
him, and Mr. Wilcox became jealous about me, however
slightly.&#160; I thought it was the involuntary thing, which men
can't help any more than we can.&#160; You know--at least, I know
in my own case--when a man has said to me, 'So-and-so's a pretty
girl,' I am seized with a momentary sourness against So-and-so, and
long to tweak her ear.&#160; It's a tiresome feeling, but not an
important one, and one easily manages it.&#160; But it wasn't only
this in Mr. Wilcox's case, I gather now."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then you love him?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret considered.&#160; "It is wonderful
knowing that a real man cares for you," she said.&#160; "The mere
fact of that grows more tremendous.&#160; Remember, I've known and
liked him steadily for nearly three years.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But loved him?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret peered into her past.&#160; It is
pleasant to analyze feelings while they are still only feelings,
and unembodied in the social fabric.&#160; With her arm round
Helen, and her eyes shifting over the view, as if this county or
that could reveal the secret of her own heart, she meditated
honestly, and said, "No."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But you will?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes," said Margaret, "of that I'm pretty
sure.&#160; Indeed, I began the moment he spoke to me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And have settled to marry him?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I had, but am wanting a long talk about it
now.&#160; What is it against him, Helen?&#160; You must try and
say."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen, in her turn, looked outwards.&#160;
"It is ever since Paul," she said finally.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But what has Mr. Wilcox to do with
Paul?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But he was there, they were all there that
morning when I came down to breakfast, and saw that Paul was
frightened--the man who loved me frightened and all his
paraphernalia fallen, so that I knew it was impossible, because
personal relations are the important thing for ever and ever, and
not this outer life of telegrams and anger."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She poured the sentence forth in one
breath, but her sister understood it, because it touched on
thoughts that were familiar between them.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's foolish.&#160; In the first place,
I disagree about the outer life.&#160; Well, we've often argued
that.&#160; The real point is that there is the widest gulf between
my love-making and yours.&#160; Yours--was romance; mine will be
prose.&#160; I'm not running it down--a very good kind of prose,
but well considered, well thought out.&#160; For instance, I know
all Mr. Wilcox's faults.&#160; He's afraid of emotion.&#160; He
cares too much about success, too little about the past.&#160; His
sympathy lacks poetry, and so isn't sympathy really.&#160; I'd even
say"--she looked at the shining lagoons--"that, spiritually, he's
not as honest as I am.&#160; Doesn't that satisfy you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, it doesn't," said Helen.&#160; "It
makes me feel worse and worse.&#160; You must be mad."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret made a movement of
irritation.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't intend him, or any man or any
woman, to be all my life--good heavens, no!&#160; There are heaps
of things in me that he doesn't, and shall never,
understand."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thus she spoke before the wedding ceremony
and the physical union, before the astonishing glass shade had
fallen that interposes between married couples and the world.&#160;
She was to keep her independence more than do most women as
yet.&#160; Marriage was to alter her fortunes rather than her
character, and she was not far wrong in boasting that she
understood her future husband.&#160; Yet he did alter her
character--a little.&#160; There was an unforeseen surprise, a
cessation of the winds and odours of life, a social pressure that
would have her think conjugally.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So with him," she continued.&#160; "There
are heaps of things in him--more especially things that he
does--that will always be hidden from me.&#160; He has all those
public qualities which you so despise and enable all this--" She
waved her hand at the landscape, which confirmed anything.&#160;
"If Wilcoxes hadn't worked and died in England for thousands of
years, you and I couldn't sit here without having our throats
cut.&#160; There would be no trains, no ships to carry us literary
people about in, no fields even.&#160; Just savagery.&#160;
No--perhaps not even that.&#160; Without their spirit life might
never have moved out of protoplasm.&#160; More and more do I refuse
to draw my income and sneer at those who guarantee it.&#160; There
are times when it seems to me--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And to me, and to all women.&#160; So one
kissed Paul."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's brutal," said Margaret.&#160; "Mine
is an absolutely different case.&#160; I've thought things
out."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It makes no difference thinking things
out.&#160; They come to the same."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;" Rubbish!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There was a long silence, during which the
tide returned into Poole Harbour.&#160; "One would lose something,"
murmured Helen, apparently to herself.&#160; The water crept over
the mud-flats towards the gorse and the blackened heather.&#160;
Branksea Island lost its immense foreshores, and became a sombre
episode of trees.&#160; Frome was forced inward towards Dorchester,
Stour against Wimborne, Avon towards Salisbury, and over the
immense displacement the sun presided, leading it to triumph ere he
sank to rest.&#160; England was alive, throbbing through all her
estuaries, crying for joy through the mouths of all her gulls, and
the north wind, with contrary motion, blew stronger against her
rising seas.&#160; What did it mean?&#160; For what end are her
fair complexities, her changes of soil, her sinuous coast?&#160;
Does she belong to those who have moulded her and made her feared
by other lands, or to those who have added nothing to her power,
but have somehow seen her, seen the whole island at once, lying as
a jewel in a silver sea, sailing as a ship of souls, with all the
brave world's fleet accompanying her towards eternity?&#160;</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 20</h3>
<p>Margaret had often wondered at the disturbance that takes place
in the world's waters, when Love, who seems so tiny a pebble, slips
in.&#160; Whom does Love concern beyond the beloved and the
lover?&#160; Yet his impact deluges a hundred shores.&#160; No
doubt the disturbance is really the spirit of the generations,
welcoming the new generation, and chafing against the ultimate
Fate, who holds all the seas in the palm of her hand.&#160; But
Love cannot understand this.&#160; He cannot comprehend another's
infinity; he is conscious only of his own--flying sunbeam, falling
rose, pebble that asks for one quiet plunge below the fretting
interplay of space and time.&#160; He knows that he will survive at
the end of things, and be gathered by Fate as a jewel from the
slime, and be handed with admiration round the assembly of the
gods.&#160; "Men did produce this," they will say, and, saying,
they will give men immortality.&#160; But meanwhile--what
agitations meanwhile!&#160; The foundations of Property and
Propriety are laid bare, twin rocks; Family Pride flounders to the
surface, puffing and blowing, and refusing to be comforted;
Theology, vaguely ascetic, gets up a nasty ground swell.&#160; Then
the lawyers are aroused--cold brood--and creep out of their
holes.&#160; They do what they can; they tidy up Property and
Propriety, reassure Theology and Family Pride.&#160; Half-guineas
are poured on the troubled waters, the lawyers creep back, and, if
all has gone well, Love joins one man and woman together in
Matrimony.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret had expected the disturbance, and
was not irritated by it.&#160; For a sensitive woman she had steady
nerves, and could bear with the incongruous and the grotesque; and,
besides, there was nothing excessive about her love-affair.&#160;
Good-humour was the dominant note of her relations with Mr. Wilcox,
or, as I must now call him, Henry.&#160; Henry did not encourage
romance, and she was no girl to fidget for it.&#160; An
acquaintance had become a lover, might become a husband, but would
retain all that she had noted in the acquaintance; and love must
confirm an old relation rather than reveal a new one.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In this spirit she promised to marry
him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He was in Swanage on the morrow, bearing
the engagement-ring.&#160; They greeted one another with a hearty
cordiality that impressed Aunt Juley.&#160; Henry dined at The
Bays, but he had engaged a bedroom in the principal hotel: he was
one of those men who knew the principal hotel by instinct.&#160;
After dinner he asked Margaret if she wouldn't care for a turn on
the Parade.&#160; She accepted, and could not repress a little
tremor; it would be her first real love scene.&#160; But as she put
on her hat she burst out laughing.&#160; Love was so unlike the
article served up in books: the joy, though genuine, was different;
the mystery an unexpected mystery.&#160; For one thing, Mr. Wilcox
still seemed a stranger.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a time they talked about the ring; then
she said:<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do you remember the Embankment at
Chelsea?&#160; It can't be ten days ago."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes," he said, laughing.&#160; "And you
and your sister were head and ears deep in some Quixotic
scheme.&#160; Ah well!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I little thought then, certainly.&#160;
Did you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't know about that; I shouldn't like
to say."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why, was it earlier?" she cried.&#160;
"Did you think of me this way earlier!&#160; How extraordinarily
interesting, Henry!&#160; Tell me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Henry had no intention of
telling.&#160; Perhaps he could not have told, for his mental
states became obscure as soon as he had passed through them.&#160;
He misliked the very word "interesting," connoting it with wasted
energy and even with morbidity.&#160; Hard facts were enough for
him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I didn't think of it," she pursued.&#160;
"No; when you spoke to me in the drawing-room, that was practically
the first.&#160; It was all so different from what it's supposed to
be.&#160; On the stage, or in books, a proposal is--how shall I put
it?&#160;--a full-blown affair, a kind of bouquet; it loses its
literal meaning.&#160; But in life a proposal really is a
proposal--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"By the way--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"--a suggestion, a seed," she concluded;
and the thought flew away into darkness.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I was thinking, if you didn't mind, that
we ought to spend this evening in a business talk; there will be so
much to settle."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I think so too.&#160; Tell me, in the
first place, how did you get on with Tibby?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"With your brother?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, during cigarettes."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, very well."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I am so glad," she answered, a little
surprised.&#160; "What did you talk about?&#160; Me,
presumably."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"About Greece too."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Greece was a very good card, Henry.&#160;
Tibby's only a boy still, and one has to pick and choose subjects a
little.&#160; Well done."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I was telling him I have shares in a
currant-farm near Calamata.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What a delightful thing to have shares
in!&#160; Can't we go there for our honeymoon?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What to do?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"To eat the currants.&#160; And isn't there
marvellous scenery?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Moderately, but it's not the kind of place
one could possibly go to with a lady."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why not?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No hotels."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Some ladies do without hotels.&#160; Are
you aware that Helen and I have walked alone over the Apennines,
with our luggage on our backs?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I wasn't aware, and, if I can manage it,
you will never do such a thing again."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She said more gravely: "You haven't found
time for a talk with Helen yet, I suppose?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do, before you go.&#160; I am so anxious
you two should be friends."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Your sister and I have always hit it off,"
he said negligently. "But we're drifting away from our
business.&#160; Let me begin at the beginning.&#160; You know that
Evie is going to marry Percy Cahill."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Dolly's uncle."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Exactly.&#160; The girl's madly in love
with him.&#160; A very good sort of fellow, but he demands--and
rightly--a suitable provision with her.&#160; And in the second
place, you will naturally understand, there is Charles.&#160;
Before leaving town, I wrote Charles a very careful letter.&#160;
You see, he has an increasing family and increasing expenses, and
the I. and W. A. is nothing particular just now, though capable of
development.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Poor fellow!" murmured Margaret, looking
out to sea, and not understanding.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Charles being the elder son, some day
Charles will have Howards End; but I am anxious, in my own
happiness, not to be unjust to others."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Of course not," she began, and then gave a
little cry.&#160; "You mean money.&#160; How stupid I am!&#160; Of
course not!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Oddly enough, he winced a little at the
word.&#160; "Yes.&#160; Money, since you put it so frankly.&#160; I
am determined to be just to all--just to you, just to them.&#160; I
am determined that my children shall have no case against
me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Be generous to them," she said
sharply.&#160; "Bother justice!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I am determined--and have already written
to Charles to that effect--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But how much have you got?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How much have you a year?&#160; I've six
hundred."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"My income?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes.&#160; We must begin with how much you
have, before we can settle how much you can give Charles.&#160;
Justice, and even generosity, depend on that."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I must say you're a downright young
woman," he observed, patting her arm and laughing a little.&#160;
"What a question to spring on a fellow!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Don't you know your income?&#160; Or don't
you want to tell it me?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's all right"--now she patted
him--"don't tell me.&#160; I don't want to know.&#160; I can do the
sum just as well by proportion.&#160; Divide your income into ten
parts.&#160; How many parts would you give to Evie, how many to
Charles, how many to Paul?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The fact is, my dear, I hadn't any
intention of bothering you with details.&#160; I only wanted to let
you know that--well, that something must be done for the others,
and you've understood me perfectly, so let's pass on to the next
point."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, we've settled that," said Margaret,
undisturbed by his strategic blunderings.&#160; "Go ahead; give
away all you can, bearing in mind I've a clear six hundred.&#160;
What a mercy it is to have all this money about one!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We've none too much, I assure you; you're
marrying a poor man.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Helen wouldn't agree with me here," she
continued.&#160; "Helen daren't slang the rich, being rich herself,
but she would like to.&#160; There's an odd notion, that I haven't
yet got hold of, running about at the back of her brain, that
poverty is somehow 'real.' She dislikes all organization, and
probably confuses wealth with the technique of wealth.&#160;
Sovereigns in a stocking wouldn't bother her; cheques do.&#160;
Helen is too relentless.&#160; One can't deal in her high-handed
manner with the world."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There's this other point, and then I must
go back to my hotel and write some letters.&#160; What's to be done
now about the house in Ducie Street?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Keep it on--at least, it depends.&#160;
When do you want to marry me?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She raised her voice, as too often, and
some youths, who were also taking the evening air, overheard
her.&#160; "Getting a bit hot, eh?" said one.&#160; Mr. Wilcox
turned on them, and said sharply, "I say!"&#160; There was
silence.&#160; "Take care I don't report you to the police." They
moved away quietly enough, but were only biding their time, and the
rest of the conversation was punctuated by peals of ungovernable
laughter.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lowering his voice and infusing a hint of
reproof into it, he said: "Evie will probably be married in
September.&#160; We could scarcely think of anything before
then."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The earlier the nicer, Henry.&#160;
Females are not supposed to say such things, but the earlier the
nicer."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How about September for us too?" he asked,
rather dryly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Right.&#160; Shall we go into Ducie Street
ourselves in September?&#160; Or shall we try to bounce Helen and
Tibby into it?&#160; That's rather an idea.&#160; They are so
unbusinesslike, we could make them do anything by judicious
management.&#160; Look here--yes.&#160; We'll do that.&#160; And we
ourselves could live at Howards End or Shropshire."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He blew out his cheeks.&#160;
"Heavens!&#160; how you women do fly round!&#160; My head's in a
whirl.&#160; Point by point, Margaret.&#160; Howards End's
impossible.&#160; I let it to Hamar Bryce on a three years'
agreement last March.&#160; Don't you remember?&#160; Oniton.&#160;
Well, that is much, much too far away to rely on entirely.&#160;
You will be able to be down there entertaining a certain amount,
but we must have a house within easy reach of Town.&#160; Only
Ducie Street has huge drawbacks.&#160; There's a mews
behind."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret could not help laughing.&#160; It
was the first she had heard of the mews behind Ducie Street.&#160;
When she was a possible tenant it had suppressed itself, not
consciously, but automatically.&#160; The breezy Wilcox manner,
though genuine, lacked the clearness of vision that is imperative
for truth.&#160; When Henry lived in Ducie Street he remembered the
mews; when he tried to let he forgot it; and if anyone had remarked
that the mews must be either there or not, he would have felt
annoyed, and afterwards have found some opportunity of stigmatizing
the speaker as academic.&#160; So does my grocer stigmatize me when
I complain of the quality of his sultanas, and he answers in one
breath that they are the best sultanas, and how can I expect the
best sultanas at that price?&#160; It is a flaw inherent in the
business mind, and Margaret may do well to be tender to it,
considering all that the business mind has done for England.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, in summer especially, the mews is a
serious nuisance.&#160; The smoking room, too, is an abominable
little den.&#160; The house opposite has been taken by operatic
people.&#160; Ducie Street's going down, it's my private
opinion."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How sad!&#160; It's only a few years since
they built those pretty houses."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Shows things are moving.&#160; Good for
trade."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I hate this continual flux of
London.&#160; It is an epitome of us at our worst--eternal
formlessness; all the qualities, good, bad, and indifferent,
streaming away--streaming, streaming for ever.&#160; That's why I
dread it so.&#160; I mistrust rivers, even in scenery.&#160; Now,
the sea--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"High tide, yes."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Hoy toid"--from the promenading
youths.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And these are the men to whom we give the
vote," observed Mr. Wilcox, omitting to add that they were also the
men to whom he gave work as clerks--work that scarcely encouraged
them to grow into other men.&#160; "However, they have their own
lives and interests.&#160; Let's get on."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He turned as he spoke, and prepared to see
her back to The Bays.&#160; The business was over.&#160; His hotel
was in the opposite direction, and if he accompanied her his
letters would be late for the post.&#160; She implored him not to
come, but he was obdurate.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"A nice beginning, if your aunt saw you
slip in alone!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But I always do go about alone.&#160;
Considering I've walked over the Apennines, it's common
sense.&#160; You will make me so angry.&#160; I don't the least
take it as a compliment."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He laughed, and lit a cigar.&#160; "It
isn't meant as a compliment, my dear.&#160; I just won't have you
going about in the dark.&#160; Such people about too!&#160; It's
dangerous.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Can't I look after myself?&#160; I do
wish--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Come along, Margaret; no wheedling."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A younger woman might have resented his
masterly ways, but Margaret had too firm a grip of life to make a
fuss.&#160; She was, in her own way, as masterly.&#160; If he was a
fortress she was a mountain peak, whom all might tread, but whom
the snows made nightly virginal.&#160; Disdaining the heroic
outfit, excitable in her methods, garrulous, episodical, shrill,
she misled her lover much as she had misled her aunt.&#160; He
mistook her fertility for weakness.&#160; He supposed her "as
clever as they make 'em," but no more, not realizing that she was
penetrating to the depths of his soul, and approving of what she
found there.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And if insight were sufficient, if the
inner life were the whole of life, their happiness has been
assured.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They walked ahead briskly.&#160; The parade
and the road after it were well lighted, but it was darker in Aunt
Juley's garden.&#160; As they were going up by the side-paths,
through some rhododendrons, Mr. Wilcox, who was in front, said
"Margaret" rather huskily, turned, dropped his cigar, and took her
in his arms.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She was startled, and nearly screamed, but
recovered herself at once, and kissed with genuine love the lips
that were pressed against her own.&#160; It was their first kiss,
and when it was over he saw her safely to the door and rang the
bell for her, but disappeared into the night before the maid
answered it.&#160; On looking back, the incident displeased
her.&#160; It was so isolated.&#160; Nothing in their previous
conversation had heralded it, and, worse still, no tenderness had
ensued.&#160; If a man cannot lead up to passion he can at all
events lead down from it, and she had hoped, after her
complaisance, for some interchange of gentle words.&#160; But he
had hurried away as if ashamed, and for an instant she was reminded
of Helen and Paul.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 21</h3>
<p>Charles had just been scolding his Dolly.&#160; She deserved the
scolding, and had bent before it, but her head, though bloody, was
unsubdued, and her chirrupings began to mingle with his retreating
thunder.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You've woken the baby.&#160; I knew you
would. (Rum-ti-foo, Rackety-tackety Tompkin!) I'm not responsible
for what Uncle Percy does, nor for anybody else or anything, so
there!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Who asked him while I was away?&#160; Who
asked my sister down to meet him?&#160; Who sent them out in the
motor day after day?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Charles, that reminds me of some
poem."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Does it indeed?&#160; We shall all be
dancing to a very different music presently.&#160; Miss Schlegel
has fairly got us on toast."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I could simply scratch that woman's eyes
out, and to say it's my fault is most unfair."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's your fault, and five months ago you
admitted it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I didn't."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You did."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Tootle, tootle, playing on the pootle!"
exclaimed Dolly, suddenly devoting herself to the child.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's all very well to turn the
conversation, but Father would never have dreamt of marrying as
long as Evie was there to make him comfortable.&#160; But you must
needs start match-making.&#160; Besides, Cahill's too old."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Of course, if you're going to be rude to
Uncle Percy--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Miss Schlegel always meant to get hold of
Howards End, and, thanks to you, she's got it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I call the way you twist things round and
make them hang together most unfair.&#160; You couldn't have been
nastier if you'd caught me flirting.&#160; Could he,
diddums?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We're in a bad hole, and must make the
best of it.&#160; I shall answer the pater's letter civilly.&#160;
He's evidently anxious to do the decent thing.&#160; But I do not
intend to forget these Schlegels in a hurry.&#160; As long as
they're on their best behaviour--Dolly, are you
listening?&#160;--we'll behave, too.&#160; But if I find them
giving themselves airs, or monopolizing my father, or at all
ill-treating him, or worrying him with their artistic beastliness,
I intend to put my foot down, yes, firmly.&#160; Taking my mother's
place!&#160; Heaven knows what poor old Paul will say when the news
reaches him."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The interlude closes.&#160; It has taken
place in Charles's garden at Hilton.&#160; He and Dolly are sitting
in deck-chairs, and their motor is regarding them placidly from its
garage across the lawn.&#160; A short-frocked edition of Charles
also regards them placidly; a perambulator edition is squeaking; a
third edition is expected shortly.&#160; Nature is turning out
Wilcoxes in this peaceful abode, so that they may inherit the
earth.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 22</h3>
<p>Margaret greeted her lord with peculiar tenderness on the
morrow.&#160; Mature as he was, she might yet be able to help him
to the building of the rainbow bridge that should connect the prose
in us with the passion.&#160; Without it we are meaningless
fragments, half monks, half beasts, unconnected arches that have
never joined into a man.&#160; With it love is born, and alights on
the highest curve, glowing against the grey, sober against the
fire.&#160; Happy the man who sees from either aspect the glory of
these outspread wings.&#160; The roads of his soul lie clear, and
he and his friends shall find easy-going.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was hard-going in the roads of Mr.
Wilcox's soul.&#160; From boyhood he had neglected them.&#160; "I
am not a fellow who bothers about my own inside."&#160; Outwardly
he was cheerful, reliable, and brave; but within, all had reverted
to chaos, ruled, so far as it was ruled at all, by an incomplete
asceticism.&#160; Whether as boy, husband, or widower, he had
always the sneaking belief that bodily passion is bad, a belief
that is desirable only when held passionately.&#160; Religion had
confirmed him.&#160; The words that were read aloud on Sunday to
him and to other respectable men were the words that had once
kindled the souls of St. Catharine and St. Francis into a white-hot
hatred of the carnal.&#160; He could-not be as the saints and love
the Infinite with a seraphic ardour, but he could be a little
ashamed of loving a wife.&#160; "Amabat, amare timebat."&#160; And
it was here that Margaret hoped to help him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It did not seem so difficult.&#160; She
need trouble him with no gift of her own.&#160; She would only
point out the salvation that was latent in his own soul, and in the
soul of every man.&#160; Only connect!&#160; That was the whole of
her sermon.&#160; Only connect the prose and the passion, and both
will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height.&#160;
Live in fragments no longer.&#160; Only connect, and the beast and
the monk, robbed of the isolation that is life to either, will
die.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor was the message difficult to
give.&#160; It need not take the form of a good "talking." By quiet
indications the bridge would be built and span their lives with
beauty.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But she failed.&#160; For there was one
quality in Henry for which she was never prepared, however much she
reminded herself of it: his obtuseness.&#160; He simply did not
notice things, and there was no more to be said.&#160; He never
noticed that Helen and Frieda were hostile, or that Tibby was not
interested in currant plantations; he never noticed the lights and
shades that exist in the grayest conversation, the finger-posts,
the milestones, the collisions, the illimitable views.&#160;
Once--on another occasion--she scolded him about it.&#160; He was
puzzled, but replied with a laugh: "My motto is Concentrate.&#160;
I've no intention of frittering away my strength on that sort of
thing." "It isn't frittering away the strength," she
protested.&#160; "It's enlarging the space in which you may be
strong." He answered: "You're a clever little woman, but my motto's
Concentrate." And this morning he concentrated with a
vengeance.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They met in the rhododendrons of
yesterday.&#160; In the daylight the bushes were inconsiderable and
the path was bright in the morning sun.&#160; She was with Helen,
who had been ominously quiet since the affair was settled.&#160;
"Here we all are!" she cried, and took him by one hand, retaining
her sister's in the other.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Here we are.&#160; Good-morning,
Helen."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen replied, "Good-morning, Mr.
Wilcox."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Henry, she has had such a nice letter from
the queer, cross boy--Do you remember him?&#160; He had a sad
moustache, but the back of his head was young."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I have had a letter too.&#160; Not a nice
one--I want to talk it over with you:" for Leonard Bast was nothing
to him now that she had given him her word; the triangle of sex was
broken for ever.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Thanks to your hint, he's clearing out of
the Porphyrion."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not a bad business that Porphyrion," he
said absently, as he took his own letter out of his pocket.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not a <em>bad</em>--" she exclaimed,
dropping his hand.&#160; "Surely, on Chelsea Embankment--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Here's our hostess.&#160; Good-morning,
Mrs. Munt.&#160; Fine rhododendrons.&#160; Good morning, Frau
Liesecke; we manage to grow flowers in England, don't we?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not a <em>bad</em> business?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No.&#160; My letter's about Howards
End.&#160; Bryce has been ordered abroad, and wants to sublet
it.&#160; I am far from sure that I shall give him
permission.&#160; There was no clause in the agreement.&#160; In my
opinion, subletting is a mistake.&#160; If he can find me another
tenant, whom I consider suitable, I may cancel the agreement.&#160;
Morning, Schlegel.&#160; Don't you think that's better than
subletting?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen had dropped her hand now, and he had
steered her past the whole party to the seaward side of the
house.&#160; Beneath them was the bourgeois little bay, which must
have yearned all through the centuries for just such a
watering-place as Swanage to be built on its margin.&#160; The
waves were colourless, and the Bournemouth steamer gave a further
touch of insipidity, drawn up against the pier and hooting wildly
for excursionists.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"When there is a sublet I find that
damage--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do excuse me, but about the
Porphyrion.&#160; I don't feel easy--might I just bother you,
Henry?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Her manner was so serious that he stopped,
and asked her a little sharply what she wanted.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You said on Chelsea Embankment, surely,
that it was a bad concern, so we advised this clerk to clear
out.&#160; He writes this morning that he's taken our advice, and
now you say it's not a bad concern.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"A clerk who clears out of any concern,
good or bad, without securing a berth somewhere else first, is a
fool, and I've no pity for him."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He has not done that.&#160; He's going
into a bank in Camden Town, he says.&#160; The salary's much lower,
but he hopes to manage--a branch of Dempster's Bank.&#160; Is that
all right?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Dempster!&#160; My goodness me,
yes."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"More right than the Porphyrion?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, yes, yes; safe as
houses--safer."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Very many thanks.&#160; I'm sorry--if you
sublet--?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If he sublets, I shan't have the same
control.&#160; In theory there should be no more damage done at
Howards End; in practice there will be.&#160; Things may be done
for which no money can compensate.&#160; For instance, I shouldn't
want that fine wych-elm spoilt.&#160; It hangs--Margaret, we must
go and see the old place some time.&#160; It's pretty in its
way.&#160; We'll motor down and have lunch with Charles."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I should enjoy that," said Margaret
bravely.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What about next Wednesday?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Wednesday?&#160; No, I couldn't well do
that.&#160; Aunt Juley expects us to stop here another week at
least."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But you can give that up now."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Er--no," said Margaret, after a moment's
thought.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, that'll be all right.&#160; I'll speak
to her."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"This visit is a high solemnity.&#160; My
aunt counts on it year after year.&#160; She turns the house upside
down for us; she invites our special friends--she scarcely knows
Frieda, and we can't leave her on her hands.&#160; I missed one
day, and she would be so hurt if I didn't stay the full ten."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But I'll say a word to her.&#160; Don't
you bother."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Henry, I won't go.&#160; Don't bully
me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You want to see the house, though?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Very much--I've heard so much about it,
one way or the other.&#160; Aren't there pigs' teeth in the
wych-elm?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"<em>Pigs' teeth?</em>"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And you chew the bark for
toothache."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What a rum notion!&#160; Of course
not!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Perhaps I have confused it with some other
tree.&#160; There are still a great number of sacred trees in
England, it seems."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But he left her to intercept Mrs. Munt,
whose voice could be heard in the distance: to be intercepted
himself by Helen.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, Mr. Wilcox, about the Porphyrion--"
she began, and went scarlet all over her face.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's all right," called Margaret, catching
them up.&#160; "Dempster's Bank's better."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But I think you told us the Porphyrion was
bad, and would smash before Christmas."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Did I?&#160; It was still outside the
Tariff Ring, and had to take rotten policies.&#160; Lately it came
in--safe as houses now."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In other words, Mr. Bast need never have
left it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, the fellow needn't."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"--and needn't have started life elsewhere
at a greatly reduced salary."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He only says 'reduced,'" corrected
Margaret, seeing trouble ahead.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"With a man so poor, every reduction must
be great.&#160; I consider it a deplorable misfortune."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Wilcox, intent on his business with
Mrs. Munt, was going steadily on, but the last remark made him say:
"What?&#160; What's that?&#160; Do you mean that I'm
responsible?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You're ridiculous, Helen."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You seem to think--" He looked at his
watch.&#160; "Let me explain the point to you.&#160; It is like
this.&#160; You seem to assume, when a business concern is
conducting a delicate negotiation, it ought to keep the public
informed stage by stage.&#160; The Porphyrion, according to you,
was bound to say, 'I am trying all I can to get into the Tariff
Ring.&#160; I am not sure that I shall succeed, but it is the only
thing that will save me from insolvency, and I am trying.' My dear
Helen--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Is that your point?&#160; A man who had
little money has less--that's mine."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I am grieved for your clerk.&#160; But it
is all in the day's work.&#160; It's part of the battle of
life."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"A man who had little money," she repeated,
"has less, owing to us.&#160; Under these circumstances I do not
consider 'the battle of life' a happy expression."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh come, come!" he protested
pleasantly.&#160; "You're not to blame.&#160; No one's to
blame."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Is no one to blame for anything?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I wouldn't say that, but you're taking it
far too seriously.&#160; Who is this fellow?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We have told you about the fellow twice
already," said Helen.&#160; "You have even met the fellow.&#160; He
is very poor and his wife is an extravagant imbecile.&#160; He is
capable of better things.&#160; We--we, the upper classes--thought
we would help him from the height of our superior knowledge--and
here's the result!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He raised his finger.&#160; "Now, a word of
advice."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I require no more advice."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"A word of advice.&#160; Don't take up that
sentimental attitude over the poor.&#160; See that she doesn't,
Margaret.&#160; The poor are poor, and one's sorry for them, but
there it is.&#160; As civilization moves forward, the shoe is bound
to pinch in places, and it's absurd to pretend that anyone is
responsible personally.&#160; Neither you, nor I, nor my informant,
nor the man who informed him, nor the directors of the Porphyrion,
are to blame for this clerk's loss of salary.&#160; It's just the
shoe pinching--no one can help it; and it might easily have been
worse."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen quivered with indignation.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"By all means subscribe to
charities--subscribe to them largely--but don't get carried away by
absurd schemes of Social Reform.&#160; I see a good deal behind the
scenes, and you can take it from me that there is no Social
Question--except for a few journalists who try to get a living out
of the phrase.&#160; There are just rich and poor, as there always
have been and always will be.&#160; Point me out a time when men
have been equal--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I didn't say--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Point me out a time when desire for
equality has made them happier.&#160; No, no.&#160; You
can't.&#160; There always have been rich and poor.&#160; I'm no
fatalist.&#160; Heaven forbid!&#160; But our civilization is
moulded by great impersonal forces" (his voice grew complacent; it
always did when he eliminated the personal), "and there always will
be rich and poor.&#160; You can't deny it" (and now it was a
respectful voice)--"and you can't deny that, in spite of all, the
tendency of civilization has on the whole been upward."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Owing to God, I suppose," flashed
Helen.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He stared at her.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You grab the dollars.&#160; God does the
rest."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was no good instructing the girl if she
was going to talk about God in that neurotic modern way.&#160;
Fraternal to the last, he left her for the quieter company of Mrs.
Munt.&#160; He thought, "She rather reminds me of Dolly."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen looked out at the sea.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Don't even discuss political economy with
Henry," advised her sister.&#160; "It'll only end in a cry."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But he must be one of those men who have
reconciled science with religion," said Helen slowly.&#160; "I
don't like those men.&#160; They are scientific themselves, and
talk of the survival of the fittest, and cut down the salaries of
their clerks, and stunt the independence of all who may menace
their comfort, but yet they believe that somehow good--and it is
always that sloppy 'somehow'--will be the outcome, and that in some
mystical way the Mr. Basts of the future will benefit because the
Mr. Basts of today are in pain."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He is such a man in theory.&#160; But oh,
Helen, in theory!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But oh, Meg, what a theory!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why should you put things so bitterly,
dearie?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Because I'm an old maid," said Helen,
biting her lip.&#160; "I can't think why I go on like this myself."
She shook off her sister's hand and went into the house.&#160;
Margaret, distressed at the day's beginning, followed the
Bournemouth steamer with her eyes.&#160; She saw that Helen's
nerves were exasperated by the unlucky Bast business beyond the
bounds of politeness.&#160; There might at any minute be a real
explosion, which even Henry would notice.&#160; Henry must be
removed.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Margaret!" her aunt called.&#160;
"Magsy!&#160; It isn't true, surely, what Mr. Wilcox says, that you
want to go away early next week?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not 'want,'" was Margaret's prompt reply;
"but there is so much to be settled, and I do want to see the
Charles'."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But going away without taking the Weymouth
trip, or even the Lulworth?" said Mrs. Munt, coming nearer.&#160;
"Without going once more up Nine Barrows Down?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'm afraid so."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Wilcox rejoined her with, "Good!&#160;
I did the breaking of the ice."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A wave of tenderness came over her.&#160;
She put a hand on either shoulder, and looked deeply into the
black, bright eyes.&#160; What was behind their competent
stare?&#160; She knew, but was not disquieted.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 23</h3>
<p>Margaret had no intention of letting things slide, and the
evening before she left Swanage she gave her sister a thorough
scolding.&#160; She censured her, not for disapproving of the
engagement, but for throwing over her disapproval a veil of
mystery.&#160; Helen was equally frank.&#160; "Yes," she said, with
the air of one looking inwards, "there is a mystery.&#160; I can't
help it.&#160; It's not my fault.&#160; It's the way life has been
made." Helen in those days was over-interested in the subconscious
self.&#160; She exaggerated the Punch and Judy aspect of life, and
spoke of mankind as puppets, whom an invisible showman twitches
into love and war.&#160; Margaret pointed out that if she dwelt on
this she, too, would eliminate the personal.&#160; Helen was silent
for a minute, and then burst into a queer speech, which cleared the
air.&#160; "Go on and marry him.&#160; I think you're splendid; and
if anyone can pull it off, you will." Margaret denied that there
was anything to "pull off," but she continued: "Yes, there is, and
I wasn't up to it with Paul.&#160; I can only do what's easy.&#160;
I can only entice and be enticed.&#160; I can't, and won't attempt
difficult relations.&#160; If I marry, it will either be a man
who's strong enough to boss me or whom I'm strong enough to
boss.&#160; So I shan't ever marry, for there aren't such
men.&#160; And Heaven help any one whom I do marry, for I shall
certainly run away from him before you can say 'Jack Robinson.'
There!&#160; Because I'm uneducated.&#160; But you, you're
different; you're a heroine."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, Helen!&#160; Am I?&#160; Will it be as
dreadful for poor Henry as all that?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You mean to keep proportion, and that's
heroic, it's Greek, and I don't see why it shouldn't succeed with
you.&#160; Go on and fight with him and help him.&#160; Don't ask
<em>me</em> for help, or even for sympathy.&#160; Henceforward I'm
going my own way.&#160; I mean to be thorough, because thoroughness
is easy.&#160; I mean to dislike your husband, and to tell him
so.&#160; I mean to make no concessions to Tibby.&#160; If Tibby
wants to live with me, he must lump me.&#160; I mean to love
<em>you</em> more than ever.&#160; Yes, I do.&#160; You and I have
built up something real, because it is purely spiritual.&#160;
There's no veil of mystery over us.&#160; Unreality and mystery
begin as soon as one touches the body.&#160; The popular view is,
as usual, exactly the wrong one.&#160; Our bothers are over
tangible things--money, husbands, house-hunting.&#160; But Heaven
will work of itself."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret was grateful for this expression
of affection, and answered, "Perhaps." All vistas close in the
unseen--no one doubts it--but Helen closed them rather too quickly
for her taste.&#160; At every turn of speech one was confronted
with reality and the absolute.&#160; Perhaps Margaret grew too old
for metaphysics, perhaps Henry was weaning her from them, but she
felt that there was something a little unbalanced in the mind that
so readily shreds the visible.&#160; The business man who assumes
that this life is everything, and the mystic who asserts that it is
nothing, fail, on this side and on that, to hit the truth.&#160;
"Yes, I see, dear; it's about halfway between," Aunt Juley had
hazarded in earlier years.&#160; No; truth, being alive, was not
halfway between anything.&#160; It was only to be found by
continuous excursions into either realm, and though proportion is
the final secret, to espouse it at the outset is to insure
sterility.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen, agreeing here, disagreeing there,
would have talked till midnight, but Margaret, with her packing to
do, focussed the conversation on Henry.&#160; She might abuse Henry
behind his back, but please would she always, be civil to him in
company?&#160; "I definitely dislike him, but I'll do what I can,"
promised Helen.&#160; "Do what you can with my friends in
return."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This conversation made Margaret
easier.&#160; Their inner life was so safe that they could bargain
over externals in a way that would have been incredible to Aunt
Juley, and impossible for Tibby or Charles.&#160; There are moments
when the inner life actually "pays," when years of self-scrutiny,
conducted for no ulterior motive, are suddenly of practical
use.&#160; Such moments are still rare in the West; that they come
at all promises a fairer future.&#160; Margaret, though unable to
understand her sister, was assured against estrangement, and
returned to London with a more peaceful mind.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The following morning, at eleven o'clock,
she presented herself at the offices of the Imperial and West
African Rubber Company.&#160; She was glad to go there, for Henry
had implied his business rather than described it, and the
formlessness and vagueness that one associates with Africa had
hitherto brooded over the main sources of his wealth.&#160; Not
that a visit to the office cleared things up.&#160; There was just
the ordinary surface scum of ledgers and polished counters and
brass bars that began and stopped for no possible reason, of
electric-light globes blossoming in triplets, of little rabbit
hutches faced with glass or wire, of little rabbits.&#160; And even
when she penetrated to the inner depths, she found only the
ordinary table and Turkey carpet, and though the map over the
fireplace did depict a helping of West Africa, it was a very
ordinary map.&#160; Another map hung opposite, on which the whole
continent appeared, looking like a whale marked out for blubber,
and by its side was a door, shut, but Henry's voice came through
it, dictating a "strong" letter.&#160; She might have been at the
Porphyrion, or Dempster's Bank, or her own wine-merchant's.&#160;
Everything seems just alike in these days.&#160; But perhaps she
was seeing the Imperial side of the company rather than its West
African, and Imperialism always had been one of her
difficulties.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"One minute!" called Mr. Wilcox on
receiving her name.&#160; He touched a bell, the effect of which
was to produce Charles.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles had written his father an adequate
letter--more adequate than Evie's, through which a girlish
indignation throbbed.&#160; And he greeted his future stepmother
with propriety.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I hope that my wife--how do you
do?&#160;--will give you a decent lunch," was his opening.&#160; "I
left instructions, but we live in a rough-and-ready way.&#160; She
expects you back to tea, too, after you have had a look at Howards
End.&#160; I wonder what you'll think of the place.&#160; I
wouldn't touch it with tongs myself.&#160; Do sit down!&#160; It's
a measly little place."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I shall enjoy seeing it," said Margaret,
feeling, for the first time, shy.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You'll see it at its worst, for Bryce
decamped abroad last Monday without even arranging for a charwoman
to clear up after him.&#160; I never saw such a disgraceful
mess.&#160; It's unbelievable.&#160; He wasn't in the house a
month."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I've more than a little bone to pick with
Bryce," called Henry from the inner chamber.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why did he go so suddenly?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Invalid type; couldn't sleep."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Poor fellow!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Poor fiddlesticks!" said Mr. Wilcox,
joining them.&#160; "He had the impudence to put up notice-boards
without as much as saying with your leave or by your leave.&#160;
Charles flung them down."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, I flung them down," said Charles
modestly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I've sent a telegram after him, and a
pretty sharp one, too.&#160; He, and he in person is responsible
for the upkeep of that house for the next three years."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The keys are at the farm; we wouldn't have
the keys."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Quite right."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Dolly would have taken them, but I was in,
fortunately."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What's Mr. Bryce like?" asked
Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But nobody cared.&#160; Mr. Bryce was the
tenant, who had no right to sublet; to have defined him further was
a waste of time.&#160; On his misdeeds they descanted profusely,
until the girl who had been typing the strong letter came out with
it.&#160; Mr. Wilcox added his signature.&#160; "Now we'll be off,"
said he.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A motor-drive, a form of felicity detested
by Margaret, awaited her.&#160; Charles saw them in, civil to the
last, and in a moment the offices of the Imperial and West African
Rubber Company faded away.&#160; But it was not an impressive
drive.&#160; Perhaps the weather was to blame, being grey and
banked high with weary clouds.&#160; Perhaps Hertfordshire is
scarcely intended for motorists.&#160; Did not a gentleman once
motor so quickly through Westmoreland that he missed it?&#160; and
if Westmoreland can be missed, it will fare ill with a county whose
delicate structure particularly needs the attentive eye.&#160;
Hertfordshire is England at its quietest, with little emphasis of
river and hill; it is England meditative.&#160; If Drayton were
with us again to write a new edition of his incomparable poem, he
would sing the nymphs of Hertfordshire as indeterminate of feature,
with hair obfuscated by the London smoke.&#160; Their eyes would be
sad, and averted from their fate towards the Northern flats, their
leader not Isis or Sabrina, but the slowly flowing Lea.&#160; No
glory of raiment would be theirs, no urgency of dance; but they
would be real nymphs.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The chauffeur could not travel as quickly
as he had hoped, for the Great North Road was full of Easter
traffic.&#160; But he went quite quick enough for Margaret, a
poor-spirited creature, who had chickens and children on the
brain.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"They're all right," said Mr. Wilcox.&#160;
"They'll learn--like the swallows and the telegraph-wires."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, but, while they're learning--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The motor's come to stay," he
answered.&#160; "One must get about.&#160; There's a pretty
church--oh, you aren't sharp enough.&#160; Well, look out, if the
road worries you--right outward at the scenery.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She looked at the scenery.&#160; It heaved
and merged like porridge.&#160; Presently it congealed.&#160; They
had arrived.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles's house on the left; on the right
the swelling forms of the Six Hills.&#160; Their appearance in such
a neighbourhood surprised her.&#160; They interrupted the stream of
residences that was thickening up towards Hilton.&#160; Beyond them
she saw meadows and a wood, and beneath them she settled that
soldiers of the best kind lay buried.&#160; She hated war and liked
soldiers--it was one of her amiable inconsistencies.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But here was Dolly, dressed up to the
nines, standing at the door to greet them, and here were the first
drops of the rain.&#160; They ran in gaily, and after a long wait
in the drawing-room sat down to the rough-and-ready lunch, every
dish in which concealed or exuded cream.&#160; Mr. Bryce was the
chief topic of conversation.&#160; Dolly described his visit with
the key, while her father-in-law gave satisfaction by chaffing her
and contradicting all she said.&#160; It was evidently the custom
to laugh at Dolly.&#160; He chaffed Margaret, too, and Margaret,
roused from a grave meditation, was pleased, and chaffed him
back.&#160; Dolly seemed surprised, and eyed her curiously.&#160;
After lunch the two children came down.&#160; Margaret disliked
babies, but hit it off better with the two-year-old, and sent Dolly
into fits of laughter by talking sense to him.&#160; "Kiss them
now, and come away," said Mr. Wilcox.&#160; She came, but refused
to kiss them: it was such hard luck on the little things, she said,
and though Dolly proffered Chorly-worly and Porgly-woggles in turn,
she was obdurate.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By this time it was raining steadily.&#160;
The car came round with the hood up, and again she lost all sense
of space.&#160; In a few minutes they stopped, and Crane opened the
door of the car.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What's happened?" asked Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What do you suppose?" said Henry.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A little porch was close up against her
face.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Are we there already?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We are."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, I never!&#160; In years ago it
seemed so far away."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Smiling, but somehow disillusioned, she
jumped out, and her impetus carried her to the front-door.&#160;
She was about to open it, when Henry said: "That's no good; it's
locked.&#160; Who's got the key?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As he had himself forgotten to call for the
key at the farm, no one replied.&#160; He also wanted to know who
had left the front gate open, since a cow had strayed in from the
road, and was spoiling the croquet lawn.&#160; Then he said rather
crossly: "Margaret, you wait in the dry.&#160; I'll go down for the
key.&#160; It isn't a hundred yards.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Mayn't I come too?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No; I shall be back before I'm
gone."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then the car turned away, and it was as if
a curtain had risen.&#160; For the second time that day she saw the
appearance of the earth.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There were the greengage-trees that Helen
had once described, there the tennis lawn, there the hedge that
would be glorious with dog-roses in June, but the vision now was of
black and palest green.&#160; Down by the dell-hole more vivid
colours were awakening, and Lent Lilies stood sentinel on its
margin, or advanced in battalions over the grass.&#160; Tulips were
a tray of jewels.&#160; She could not see the wych-elm tree, but a
branch of the celebrated vine, studded with velvet knobs, had
covered the porch.&#160; She was struck by the fertility of the
soil; she had seldom been in a garden where the flowers looked so
well, and even the weeds she was idly plucking out of the porch
were intensely green.&#160; Why had poor Mr. Bryce fled from all
this beauty?&#160; For she had already decided that the place was
beautiful.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Naughty cow!&#160; Go away!" cried
Margaret to the cow, but without indignation.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Harder came the rain, pouring out of a
windless sky, and spattering up from the notice-boards of the
house-agents, which lay in a row on the lawn where Charles had
hurled them.&#160; She must have interviewed Charles in another
world--where one did have interviews.&#160; How Helen would revel
in such a notion!&#160; Charles dead, all people dead, nothing
alive but houses and gardens.&#160; The obvious dead, the
intangible alive, and--no connection at all between them!&#160;
Margaret smiled.&#160; Would that her own fancies were as
clear-cut!&#160; Would that she could deal as high-handedly with
the world!&#160; Smiling and sighing, she laid her hand upon the
door.&#160; It opened.&#160; The house was not locked up at
all.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She hesitated.&#160; Ought she to wait for
Henry?&#160; He felt strongly about property, and might prefer to
show her over himself.&#160; On the other hand, he had told her to
keep in the dry, and the porch was beginning to drip.&#160; So she
went in, and the drought from inside slammed the door behind.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Desolation greeted her.&#160; Dirty
finger-prints were on the hall-windows, flue and rubbish on its
unwashed boards.&#160; The civilization of luggage had been here
for a month, and then decamped.&#160; Dining-room and drawing
room--right and left--were guessed only by their wall-papers.&#160;
They were just rooms where one could shelter from the rain.&#160;
Across the ceiling of each ran a great beam.&#160; The dining-room
and hall revealed theirs openly, but the drawing-room's was
match-boarded--because the facts of life must be concealed from
ladies?&#160; Drawing-room, dining-room, and hall--how petty the
names sounded!&#160; Here were simply three rooms where children
could play and friends shelter from the rain.&#160; Yes, and they
were beautiful.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then she opened one of the doors
opposite--there were two--and exchanged wall-papers for
whitewash.&#160; It was the servants' part, though she scarcely
realized that: just rooms again, where friends might shelter.&#160;
The garden at the back was full of flowering cherries and
plums.&#160; Farther on were hints of the meadow and a black cliff
of pines.&#160; Yes, the meadow was beautiful.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Penned in by the desolate weather, she
recaptured the sense of space which the motor had tried to rob from
her.&#160; She remembered again that ten square miles are not ten
times as wonderful as one square mile, that a thousand square miles
are not practically the same as heaven.&#160; The phantom of
bigness, which London encourages, was laid for ever when she paced
from the hall at Howards End to its kitchen and heard the rains run
this way and that where the watershed of the roof divided
them.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now Helen came to her mind, scrutinizing
half Wessex from the ridge of the Purbeck Downs, and saying: "You
will have to lose something." She was not so sure.&#160; For
instance, she would double her kingdom by opening the door that
concealed the stairs.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now she thought of the map of Africa; of
empires; of her father; of the two supreme nations, streams of
whose life warmed her blood, but, mingling, had cooled her
brain.&#160; She paced back into the hall, and as she did so the
house reverberated.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Is that you, Henry?" she called.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There was no answer, but the house
reverberated again.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Henry, have you got in?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But it was the heart of the house beating,
faintly at first, then loudly, martially.&#160; It dominated the
rain.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is the starved imagination, not the
well-nourished, that is afraid.&#160; Margaret flung open the door
to the stairs.&#160; A noise as of drums seemed to deafen
her.&#160; A woman, an old woman, was descending, with figure
erect, with face impassive, with lips that parted and said
dryly:<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh!&#160; Well, I took you for Ruth
Wilcox."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret stammered: "I--Mrs.
Wilcox--I?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In fancy, of course--in fancy.&#160; You
had her way of walking.&#160; Good-day." And the old woman passed
out into the rain.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 24</h3>
<p>"It gave her quite a turn," said Mr. Wilcox, when retailing the
incident to Dolly at tea-time.&#160; "None of you girls have any
nerves, really.&#160; Of course, a word from me put it all right,
but silly old Miss Avery--she frightened you, didn't she,
Margaret?&#160; There you stood clutching a bunch of weeds.&#160;
She might have said something, instead of coming down the stairs
with that alarming bonnet on.&#160; I passed her as I came
in.&#160; Enough to make the car shy.&#160; I believe Miss Avery
goes in for being a character; some old maids do." He lit a
cigarette.&#160; "It is their last resource.&#160; Heaven knows
what she was doing in the place; but that's Bryce's business, not
mine."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I wasn't as foolish as you suggest," said
Margaret.&#160; "She only startled me, for the house had been
silent so long."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Did you take her for a spook?" asked
Dolly, for whom "spooks" and "going to church" summarized the
unseen.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not exactly."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She really did frighten you," said Henry,
who was far from discouraging timidity in females.&#160; "Poor
Margaret!&#160; And very naturally.&#160; Uneducated classes are so
stupid."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Is Miss Avery uneducated classes?"
Margaret asked, and found herself looking at the decoration scheme
of Dolly's drawing-room.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She's just one of the crew at the
farm.&#160; People like that always assume things.&#160; She
assumed you'd know who she was.&#160; She left all the Howards End
keys in the front lobby, and assumed that you'd seen them as you
came in, that you'd lock up the house when you'd done, and would
bring them on down to her.&#160; And there was her niece hunting
for them down at the farm.&#160; Lack of education makes people
very casual.&#160; Hilton was full of women like Miss Avery
once."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I shouldn't have disliked it,
perhaps."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Or Miss Avery giving me a wedding
present," said Dolly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Which was illogical but interesting.&#160;
Through Dolly, Margaret was destined to learn a good deal.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But Charles said I must try not to mind,
because she had known his grandmother."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"As usual, you've got the story wrong, my
good Dorothea."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I mean great-grandmother--the one who left
Mrs. Wilcox the house.&#160; Weren't both of them and Miss Avery
friends when Howards End, too, was a farm?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Her father-in-law blew out a shaft of
smoke.&#160; His attitude to his dead wife was curious.&#160; He
would allude to her, and hear her discussed, but never mentioned
her by name.&#160; Nor was he interested in the dim, bucolic
past.&#160; Dolly was--for the following reason.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then hadn't Mrs. Wilcox a brother--or was
it an uncle?&#160; Anyhow, he popped the question, and Miss Avery,
she said 'No.' Just imagine, if she'd said 'Yes,' she would have
been Charles's aunt. (Oh, I say,--that's rather good!&#160;
'Charlie's Aunt'!&#160; I must chaff him about that this evening.)
And the man went out and was killed.&#160; Yes, I'm certain I've
got it right now.&#160; Tom Howard--he was the last of them."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I believe so," said Mr. Wilcox
negligently.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I say!&#160; Howards End--Howard's Ended!"
cried Dolly.&#160; "I'm rather on the spot this evening, eh?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I wish you'd ask whether Crane's
ended."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, Mr. Wilcox, how <em>can</em>
you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Because, if he has had enough tea, we
ought to go.--Dolly's a good little woman," he continued, "but a
little of her goes a long way.&#160; I couldn't live near her if
you paid me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret smiled.&#160; Though presenting a
firm front to outsiders, no Wilcox could live near, or near the
possessions of, any other Wilcox.&#160; They had the colonial
spirit, and were always making for some spot where the white man
might carry his burden unobserved.&#160; Of course, Howards End was
impossible, so long as the younger couple were established in
Hilton.&#160; His objections to the house were plain as daylight
now.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Crane had had enough tea, and was sent to
the garage, where their car had been trickling muddy water over
Charles's.&#160; The downpour had surely penetrated the Six Hills
by now, bringing news of our restless civilization.&#160; "Curious
mounds," said, Henry, "but in with you now; another time." He had
to be up in London by seven--if possible, by six-thirty.&#160; Once
more she lost the sense of space; once more trees, houses, people,
animals, hills, merged and heaved into one dirtiness, and she was
at Wickham Place.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Her evening was pleasant.&#160; The sense
of flux which had haunted her all the year disappeared for a
time.&#160; She forgot the luggage and the motor-cars, and the
hurrying men who know so much and connect so little.&#160; She
recaptured the sense of space, which is the basis of all earthly
beauty, and, starting from Howards End, she attempted to realize
England.&#160; She failed--visions do not come when we try, though
they may come through trying.&#160; But an unexpected love of the
island awoke in her, connecting on this side with the joys of the
flesh, on that with the inconceivable.&#160; Helen and her father
had known this love, poor Leonard Bast was groping after it, but it
had been hidden from Margaret till this afternoon.&#160; It had
certainly come through the house and old Miss Avery.&#160; Through
them: the notion of "through" persisted; her mind trembled towards
a conclusion which only the unwise have put into words.&#160; Then,
veering back into warmth, it dwelt on ruddy bricks, flowering
plum-trees, and all the tangible joys of, spring.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Henry, after allaying her agitation, had
taken her over his property, and had explained to her the use and
dimensions of the various rooms.&#160; He had sketched the history
of the little estate.&#160; "It is so unlucky," ran the monologue,
"that money wasn't put into it about fifty years ago.&#160; Then it
had four--five-times the land--thirty acres at least.&#160; One
could have made something out of it then--a small park, or at all
events shrubberies, and rebuilt the house farther away from the
road.&#160; What's the good of taking it in hand now?&#160; Nothing
but the meadow left, and even that was heavily mortgaged when I
first had to do with things--yes, and the house too.&#160; Oh, it
was no joke." She saw two women as he spoke, one old, the other
young, watching their inheritance melt away.&#160; She saw them
greet him as a deliverer.&#160; "Mismanagement did it--besides, the
days for small farms are over.&#160; It doesn't pay--except with
intensive cultivation.&#160; Small holdings, back to the
land--ah!&#160; philanthropic bunkum.&#160; Take it as a rule that
nothing pays on a small scale.&#160; Most of the land you see (they
were standing at an upper window, the only one which faced west)
belongs to the people at the Park--they made their pile over
copper--good chaps.&#160; Avery's Farm, Sishe's--what they call the
Common, where you see that ruined oak--one after the other fell in,
and so did this, as near as is no matter.&#160; "But Henry had
saved it; without fine feelings or deep insight, but he had saved
it, and she loved him for the deed.&#160; "When I had more control
I did what I could: sold off the two and a half animals, and the
mangy pony, and the superannuated tools; pulled down the outhouses;
drained; thinned out I don't know how many guelder-roses and
elder-trees; and inside the house I turned the old kitchen into a
hall, and made a kitchen behind where the dairy was.&#160; Garage
and so on came later.&#160; But one could still tell it's been an
old farm.&#160; And yet it isn't the place that would fetch one of
your artistic crew." No, it wasn't; and if he did not quite
understand it, the artistic crew would still less: it was English,
and the wych-elm that she saw from the window was an English
tree.&#160; No report had prepared her for its peculiar
glory.&#160; It was neither warrior, nor lover, nor god; in none of
these roles do the English excel.&#160; It was a comrade, bending
over the house, strength and adventure in its roots, but in its
utmost fingers tenderness, and the girth, that a dozen men could
not have spanned, became in the end evanescent, till pale bud
clusters seemed to float in the air.&#160; It was a comrade.&#160;
House and tree transcended any similes of sex.&#160; Margaret
thought of them now, and was to think of them through many a windy
night and London day, but to compare either to man, to woman,
always dwarfed the vision.&#160; Yet they kept within limits of the
human.&#160; Their message was not of eternity, but of hope on this
side of the grave.&#160; As she stood in the one, gazing at the
other, truer relationship had gleamed.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another touch, and the account of her day
is finished.&#160; They entered the garden for a minute, and to Mr.
Wilcox's surprise she was right.&#160; Teeth, pigs' teeth, could be
seen in the bark of the wych-elm tree--just the white tips of them
showing.&#160; "Extraordinary!" he cried.&#160; "Who told
you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I heard of it one winter in London," was
her answer, for she, too, avoided mentioning Mrs. Wilcox by
name.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 25</h3>
<p>Evie heard of her father's engagement when she was in for a
tennis tournament, and her play went simply to pot.&#160; That she
should marry and leave him had seemed natural enough; that he, left
alone, should do the same was deceitful; and now Charles and Dolly
said that it was all her fault.&#160; "But I never dreamt of such a
thing," she grumbled.&#160; "Dad took me to call now and then, and
made me ask her to Simpson's.&#160; Well, I'm altogether off Dad."
It was also an insult to their mother's memory; there they were
agreed, and Evie had the idea of returning Mrs. Wilcox's lace and
jewellery "as a protest." Against what it would protest she was not
clear; but being only eighteen, the idea of renunciation appealed
to her, the more as she did not care for jewellery or lace.&#160;
Dolly then suggested that she and Uncle Percy should pretend to
break off their engagement, and then perhaps Mr. Wilcox would
quarrel with Miss Schlegel, and break off his; or Paul might be
cabled for.&#160; But at this point Charles told them not to talk
nonsense.&#160; So Evie settled to marry as soon as possible; it
was no good hanging about with these Schlegels eyeing her.&#160;
The date of her wedding was consequently put forward from September
to August, and in the intoxication of presents she recovered much
of her good-humour.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret found that she was expected to
figure at this function, and to figure largely; it would be such an
opportunity, said Henry, for her to get to know his set.&#160; Sir
James Bidder would be there, and all the Cahills and the Fussells,
and his sister-in-law, Mrs. Warrington Wilcox, had fortunately got
back from her tour round the world.&#160; Henry she loved, but his
set promised to be another matter.&#160; He had not the knack of
surrounding himself with nice people--indeed, for a man of ability
and virtue his choice had been singularly unfortunate; he had no
guiding principle beyond a certain preference for mediocrity; he
was content to settle one of the greatest things in life haphazard,
and so, while his investments went right, his friends generally
went wrong.&#160; She would be told, "Oh, So-and-so's a good
sort--a thundering good sort," and find, on meeting him, that he
was a brute or a bore.&#160; If Henry had shown real affection, she
would have understood, for affection explains everything.&#160; But
he seemed without sentiment.&#160; The "thundering good sort" might
at any moment become "a fellow for whom I never did have much use,
and have less now," and be shaken off cheerily into oblivion.&#160;
Margaret had done the same as a schoolgirl.&#160; Now she never
forgot anyone for whom she had once cared; she connected, though
the connection might be bitter, and she hoped that some day Henry
would do the same.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Evie was not to be married from Ducie
Street.&#160; She had a fancy for something rural, and, besides, no
one would be in London then, so she left her boxes for a few weeks
at Oniton Grange, and her banns were duly published in the parish
church, and for a couple of days the little town, dreaming between
the ruddy hills, was roused by the clang of our civilization, and
drew up by the roadside to let the motors pass.&#160; Oniton had
been a discovery of Mr. Wilcox's--a discovery of which he was not
altogether proud.&#160; It was up towards the Welsh border, and so
difficult of access that he had concluded it must be something
special.&#160; A ruined castle stood in the grounds.&#160; But
having got there, what was one to do?&#160; The shooting was bad,
the fishing indifferent, and women-folk reported the scenery as
nothing much.&#160; The place turned out to be in the wrong part of
Shropshire, damn it, and though he never damned his own property
aloud, he was only waiting to get it off his hands, and then to let
fly.&#160; Evie's marriage was its last appearance in public.&#160;
As soon as a tenant was found, it became a house for which he never
had had much use, and had less now, and, like Howards End, faded
into Limbo.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But on Margaret Oniton was destined to make
a lasting impression.&#160; She regarded it as her future home, and
was anxious to start straight with the clergy, etc., and, if
possible, to see something of the local life.&#160; It was a
market-town--as tiny a one as England possesses--and had for ages
served that lonely valley, and guarded our marches against the
Kelt.&#160; In spite of the occasion, in spite of the numbing
hilarity that greeted her as soon as she got into the reserved
saloon at Paddington, her senses were awake and watching, and
though Oniton was to prove one of her innumerable false starts, she
never forgot it, nor the things that happened there.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The London party only numbered eight--the
Fussells, father and son, two Anglo-Indian ladies named Mrs.
Plynlimmon and Lady Edser, Mrs. Warrington Wilcox and her daughter,
and lastly, the little girl, very smart and quiet, who figures at
so many weddings, and who kept a watchful eye on Margaret, the
bride-elect, Dolly was absent--a domestic event detained her at
Hilton; Paul had cabled a humorous message; Charles was to meet
them with a trio of motors at Shrewsbury.&#160; Helen had refused
her invitation; Tibby had never answered his.&#160; The management
was excellent, as was to be expected with anything that Henry
undertook; one was conscious of his sensible and generous brain in
the background.&#160; They were his guests as soon as they reached
the train; a special label for their luggage; a courier; a special
lunch; they had only to look pleasant and, where possible,
pretty.&#160; Margaret thought with dismay of her own
nuptials--presumably under the management of Tibby.&#160; "Mr.
Theobald Schlegel and Miss Helen Schlegel request the pleasure of
Mrs. Plynlimmon's company on the occasion of the marriage of their
sister Margaret."&#160; The formula was incredible, but it must
soon be printed and sent, and though Wickham Place need not compete
with Oniton, it must feed its guests properly, and provide them
with sufficient chairs.&#160; Her wedding would either be
ramshackly or bourgeois--she hoped the latter.&#160; Such an affair
as the present, staged with a deftness that was almost beautiful,
lay beyond her powers and those of her friends.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The low rich purr of a Great Western
express is not the worst background for conversation, and the
journey passed pleasantly enough.&#160; Nothing could have exceeded
the kindness of the two men.&#160; They raised windows for some
ladies, and lowered them for others, they rang the bell for the
servant, they identified the colleges as the train slipped past
Oxford, they caught books or bag-purses in the act of tumbling on
to the floor.&#160; Yet there was nothing finicky about their
politeness: it had the Public School touch, and, though sedulous,
was virile.&#160; More battles than Waterloo have been won on our
playing-fields, and Margaret bowed to a charm of which she did not
wholly approve, and said nothing when the Oxford colleges were
identified wrongly.&#160; "Male and female created He them"; the
journey to Shrewsbury confirmed this questionable statement, and
the long glass saloon, that moved so easily and felt so
comfortable, became a forcing-house for the idea of sex.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At Shrewsbury came fresh air.&#160;
Margaret was all for sight-seeing, and while the others were
finishing their tea at the Raven, she annexed a motor and hurried
over the astonishing city.&#160; Her chauffeur was not the faithful
Crane, but an Italian, who dearly loved making her late.&#160;
Charles, watch in hand, though with a level brow, was standing in
front of the hotel when they returned.&#160; It was perfectly all
right, he told her; she was by no means the last.&#160; And then he
dived into the coffee-room, and she heard him say, "For God's sake,
hurry the women up; we shall never be off," and Albert Fussell
reply, "Not I; I've done my share," and Colonel Fussell opine that
the ladies were getting themselves up to kill.&#160; Presently Myra
(Mrs. Warrington's daughter) appeared, and as she was his cousin,
Charles blew her up a little: she had been changing her smart
traveling hat for a smart motor hat.&#160; Then Mrs. Warrington
herself, leading the quiet child; the two Anglo-Indian ladies were
always last.&#160; Maids, courier, heavy luggage, had already gone
on by a branch-line to a station nearer Oniton, but there were five
hat-boxes and four dressing-bags to be packed, and five dust-cloaks
to be put on, and to be put off at the last moment, because Charles
declared them not necessary.&#160; The men presided over everything
with unfailing good-humour.&#160; By half-past five the party was
ready, and went out of Shrewsbury by the Welsh Bridge.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Shropshire had not the reticence of
Hertfordshire.&#160; Though robbed of half its magic by swift
movement, it still conveyed the sense of hills.&#160; They were
nearing the buttresses that force the Severn eastern and make it an
English stream, and the sun, sinking over the Sentinels of Wales,
was straight in their eyes.&#160; Having picked up another guest,
they turned southward, avoiding the greater mountains, but
conscious of an occasional summit, rounded and mild, whose
colouring differed in quality from that of the lower earth, and
whose contours altered more slowly.&#160; Quiet mysteries were in
progress behind those tossing horizons: the West, as ever, was
retreating with some secret which may not be worth the discovery,
but which no practical man will ever discover.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They spoke of Tariff Reform.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Warrington was just back from the
Colonies.&#160; Like many other critics of Empire, her mouth had
been stopped with food, and she could only exclaim at the
hospitality with which she had been received, and warn the Mother
Country against trifling with young Titans.&#160; "They threaten to
cut the painter," she cried, "and where shall we be then?&#160;
Miss Schlegel, you'll undertake to keep Henry sound about Tariff
Reform?&#160; It is our last hope."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret playfully confessed herself on the
other side, and they began to quote from their respective
hand-books while the motor carried them deep into the hills.&#160;
Curious these were, rather than impressive, for their outlines
lacked beauty, and the pink fields--on their summits suggested the
handkerchiefs of a giant spread out to dry.&#160; An occasional
outcrop of rock, an occasional wood, an occasional "forest,"
treeless and brown, all hinted at wildness to follow, but the main
colour was an agricultural green.&#160; The air grew cooler; they
had surmounted the last gradient, and Oniton lay below them with
its church, its radiating houses, its castle, its river-girt
peninsula.&#160; Close to the castle was a grey mansion,
unintellectual but kindly, stretching with its grounds across the
peninsula's neck--the sort of mansion that was built all over
England in the beginning of the last century, while architecture
was still an expression of the national character.&#160; That was
the Grange, remarked Albert, over his shoulder, and then he jammed
the brake on, and the motor slowed down and stopped.&#160; "I'm
sorry," said he, turning round.&#160; "Do you mind getting out--by
the door on the right?&#160; Steady on!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What's happened?" asked Mrs.
Warrington.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then the car behind them drew up, and the
voice of Charles was heard saying: "Get out the women at once."
There was a concourse of males, and Margaret and her companions
were hustled out and received into the second car.&#160; What had
happened?&#160; As it started off again, the door of a cottage
opened, and a girl screamed wildly at them.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What is it?" the ladies cried.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles drove them a hundred yards without
speaking.&#160; Then he said: "It's all right.&#160; Your car just
touched a dog."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But stop!" cried Margaret,
horrified.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It didn't hurt him."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Didn't really hurt him?" asked Myra.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do <em>please</em> stop!" said Margaret,
leaning forward.&#160; She was standing up in the car, the other
occupants holding her knees to steady her.&#160; "I want to go
back, please."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles took no notice.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We've left Mr. Fussell behind," said
another; "and Angelo, and Crane."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, but no woman."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I expect a little of"--Mrs. Warrington
scratched her palm--" will be more to the point than one of
us!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The insurance company sees to that,"
remarked Charles, "and Albert will do the talking."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I want to go back, though, I say!"
repeated Margaret, getting angry.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles took no notice.&#160; The motor,
loaded with refugees, continued to travel very slowly down the
hill.&#160; "The men are there," chorused the others.&#160; "Men
will see to it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The men <em>can't</em> see to it.&#160;
Oh, this is ridiculous!&#160; Charles, I ask you to stop."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Stopping's no good," drawled
Charles.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Isn't it?" said Margaret, and jumped
straight out of the car.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She fell on her knees, cut her gloves,
shook her hat over her ear.&#160; Cries of alarm followed
her.&#160; "You've hurt yourself," exclaimed Charles, jumping after
her.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Of course I've hurt myself!" she
retorted.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"May I ask what--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There's nothing to ask," said
Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Your hand's bleeding."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I know."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'm in for a frightful row from the
pater."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You should have thought of that sooner,
Charles."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles had never been in such a position
before.&#160; It was a woman in revolt who was hobbling away from
him, and the sight was too strange to leave any room for
anger.&#160; He recovered himself when the others caught them up:
their sort he understood.&#160; He commanded them to go back.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Albert Fussell was seen walking towards
them.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's all right!" he called.&#160; "It
wasn't a dog, it was a cat."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There!" exclaimed Charles
triumphantly.&#160; "It's only a rotten cat.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Got room in your car for a little
un?&#160; I cut as soon as I saw it wasn't a dog; the chauffeurs
are tackling the girl."&#160; But Margaret walked forward
steadily.&#160; Why should the chauffeurs tackle the girl?&#160;
Ladies sheltering behind men, men sheltering behind servants--the
whole system's wrong, and she must challenge it.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Miss Schlegel!&#160; 'Pon my word, you've
hurt your hand."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'm just going to see," said
Margaret.&#160; "Don't you wait, Mr. Fussell."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second motor came round the
corner.&#160; "lt is all right, madam," said Crane in his
turn.&#160; He had taken to calling her madam.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What's all right?&#160; The cat?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, madam.&#160; The girl will receive
compensation for it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She was a very ruda girla," said Angelo
from the third motor thoughtfully.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Wouldn't you have been rude?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Italian spread out his hands, implying
that he had not thought of rudeness, but would produce it if it
pleased her.&#160; The situation became absurd.&#160; The gentlemen
were again buzzing round Miss Schlegel with offers of assistance,
and Lady Edser began to bind up her hand.&#160; She yielded,
apologizing slightly, and was led back to the car, and soon the
landscape resumed its motion, the lonely cottage disappeared, the
castle swelled on its cushion of turf, and they had arrived.&#160;
No doubt she had disgraced herself.&#160; But she felt their whole
journey from London had been unreal.&#160; They had no part with
the earth and its emotions.&#160; They were dust, and a stink, and
cosmopolitan chatter, and the girl whose cat had been killed had
lived more deeply than they.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, Henry," she exclaimed, "I have been so
naughty," for she had decided to take up this line.&#160; "We ran
over a cat.&#160; Charles told me not to jump out, but I would, and
look!"&#160; She held out her bandaged hand.&#160; "Your poor Meg
went such a flop."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Wilcox looked bewildered.&#160; In
evening dress, he was standing to welcome his guests in the
hall.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Thinking it was a dog," added Mrs.
Warrington.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ah, a dog's a companion!" said Colonel
Fussell.&#160; "A dog'll remember you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Have you hurt yourself, Margaret?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not to speak about; and it's my left
hand."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, hurry up and change."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She obeyed, as did the others.&#160; Mr.
Wilcox then turned to his son.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Now, Charles, what's happened?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles was absolutely honest.&#160; He
described what he believed to have happened.&#160; Albert had
flattened out a cat, and Miss Schlegel had lost her nerve, as any
woman might.&#160; She had been got safely into the other car, but
when it was in motion had leapt out--again, in spite of all that
they could say.&#160; After walking a little on the road, she had
calmed down and had said that she was sorry.&#160; His father
accepted this explanation, and neither knew that Margaret had
artfully prepared the way for it.&#160; It fitted in too well with
their view of feminine nature.&#160; In the smoking-room, after
dinner, the Colonel put forward the view that Miss Schlegel had
jumped it out of devilry.&#160; Well he remembered as a young man,
in the harbour of Gibraltar once, how a girl--a handsome girl,
too--had jumped overboard for a bet.&#160; He could see her now,
and all the lads overboard after her.&#160; But Charles and Mr.
Wilcox agreed it was much more probably nerves in Miss Schlegel's
case.&#160; Charles was depressed.&#160; That woman had a
tongue.&#160; She would bring worse disgrace on his father before
she had done with them.&#160; He strolled out on to the castle
mound to think the matter over.&#160; The evening was
exquisite.&#160; On three sides of him a little river whispered,
full of messages from the west; above his head the ruins made
patterns against the sky.&#160; He carefully reviewed their
dealings with this family, until he fitted Helen, and Margaret, and
Aunt Juley into an orderly conspiracy.&#160; Paternity had made him
suspicious.&#160; He had two children to look after, and more
coming, and day by day they seemed less likely to grow up rich
men.&#160; "It is all very well," he reflected, "the pater saying
that he will be just to all, but one can't be just
indefinitely.&#160; Money isn't elastic.&#160; What's to happen if
Evie has a family?&#160; And, come to that, so may the pater.&#160;
There'll not be enough to go round, for there's none coming in,
either through Dolly or Percy.&#160; It's damnable!"&#160; He
looked enviously at the Grange, whose windows poured light and
laughter.&#160; First and last, this wedding would cost a pretty
penny.&#160; Two ladies were strolling up and down the garden
terrace, and as the syllables "Imperialism" were wafted to his
ears, he guessed that one of them was his aunt.&#160; She might
have helped him, if she too had not had a family to provide
for.&#160; "Every one for himself," he repeated--a maxim which had
cheered him in the past, but which rang grimly enough among the
ruins of Oniton.&#160; He lacked his father's ability in business,
and so had an ever higher regard for money; unless he could inherit
plenty, he feared to leave his children poor.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As he sat thinking, one of the ladies left
the terrace and walked into the meadow; he recognized her as
Margaret by the white bandage that gleamed on her arm, and put out
his cigar, lest the gleam should betray him.&#160; She climbed up
the mound in zigzags, and at times stooped down, as if she was
stroking the turf.&#160; It sounds absolutely incredible, but for a
moment Charles thought that she was in love with him, and had come
out to tempt him.&#160; Charles believed in temptresses, who are
indeed the strong man's necessary complement, and having no sense
of humour, he could not purge himself of the thought by a
smile.&#160; Margaret, who was engaged to his father, and his
sister's wedding-guest, kept on her way without noticing him, and
he admitted that he had wronged her on this point.&#160; But what
was she doing?&#160; Why was she stumbling about amongst the rubble
and catching her dress in brambles and burrs?&#160; As she edged
round the keep, she must have got to leeward and smelt his
cigar-smoke, for she exclaimed, "Hullo!&#160; Who's that?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles made no answer.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Saxon or Kelt?" she continued, laughing in
the darkness.&#160; "But it doesn't matter.&#160; Whichever you
are, you will have to listen to me.&#160; I love this place.&#160;
I love Shropshire.&#160; I hate London.&#160; I am glad that this
will be my home.&#160; Ah, dear"--she was now moving back towards
the house--"what a comfort to have arrived!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That woman means mischief," thought
Charles, and compressed his lips.&#160; In a few minutes he
followed her indoors, as the ground was getting damp.&#160; Mists
were rising from the river, and presently it became invisible,
though it whispered more loudly.&#160; There had been a heavy
downpour in the Welsh hills.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 26</h3>
<p>Next morning a fine mist covered the peninsula.&#160; The
weather promised well, and the outline of the castle mound grew
clearer each moment that Margaret watched it.&#160; Presently she
saw the keep, and the sun painted the rubble gold, and charged the
white sky with blue.&#160; The shadow of the house gathered itself
together and fell over the garden.&#160; A cat looked up at her
window and mewed.&#160; Lastly the river appeared, still holding
the mists between its banks and its overhanging alders, and only
visible as far as a hill, which cut off its upper reaches.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret was fascinated by Oniton.&#160;
She had said that she loved it, but it was rather its romantic
tension that held her.&#160; The rounded Druids of whom she had
caught glimpses in her drive, the rivers hurrying down from them to
England, the carelessly modelled masses of the lower hills,
thrilled her with poetry.&#160; The house was insignificant, but
the prospect from it would be an eternal joy, and she thought of
all the friends she would have to stop in it, and of the conversion
of Henry himself to a rural life.&#160; Society, too, promised
favourably.&#160; The rector of the parish had dined with them last
night, and she found that he was a friend of her father's, and so
knew what to find in her.&#160; She liked him.&#160; He would
introduce her to the town.&#160; While, on her other side, Sir
James Bidder sat, repeating that she only had to give the word, and
he would whip up the county families for twenty miles round.&#160;
Whether Sir James, who was Garden Seeds, had promised what he could
perform, she doubted, but so long as Henry mistook them for the
county families when they did call, she was content.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles and Albert Fussell now crossed the
lawn.&#160; They were going for a morning dip, and a servant
followed them with their bathing-dresses.&#160; She had meant to
take a stroll herself before breakfast, but saw that the day was
still sacred to men, and amused herself by watching their
contretemps.&#160; In the first place the key of the bathing-shed
could not be found.&#160; Charles stood by the riverside with
folded hands, tragical, while the servant shouted, and was
misunderstood by another servant in the garden.&#160; Then came a
difficulty about a spring-board, and soon three people were running
backwards and forwards over the meadow, with orders and counter
orders and recriminations and apologies.&#160; If Margaret wanted
to jump from a motor-car, she jumped; if Tibby thought paddling
would benefit his ankles, he paddled; if a clerk desired adventure,
he took a walk in the dark.&#160; But these athletes seemed
paralysed.&#160; They could not bathe without their appliances,
though the morning sun was calling and the last mists were rising
from the dimpling stream.&#160; Had they found the life of the body
after all?&#160; Could not the men whom they despised as milksops
beat them, even on their own ground?&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She thought of the bathing arrangements as
they should be in her day--no worrying of servants, no appliances,
beyond good sense.&#160; Her reflections were disturbed by the
quiet child, who had come out to speak to the cat, but was now
watching her watch the men.&#160; She called, "Good-morning, dear,"
a little sharply.&#160; Her voice spread consternation.&#160;
Charles looked round, and though completely attired in indigo blue,
vanished into the shed, and was seen no more.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Miss Wilcox is up--" the child whispered,
and then became unintelligible.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What's that?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It sounded like, "--cut-yoke--sack
back--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I can't hear."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"--On the bed--tissue-paper--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Gathering that the wedding-dress was on
view, and that a visit would be seemly, she went to Evie's
room.&#160; All was hilarity here.&#160; Evie, in a petticoat, was
dancing with one of the Anglo-Indian ladies, while the other was
adoring yards of white satin.&#160; They screamed, they laughed,
they sang, and the dog barked.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret screamed a little too, but without
conviction.&#160; She could not feel that a wedding was so
funny.&#160; Perhaps something was missing in her equipment.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Evie gasped: "Dolly is a rotter not to be
here!&#160; Oh, we would rag just then!"&#160; Then Margaret went
down to breakfast.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Henry was already installed; he ate slowly
and spoke little, and was, in Margaret's eyes, the only member of
their party who dodged emotion successfully.&#160; She could not
suppose him indifferent either to the loss of his daughter or to
the presence of his future wife.&#160; Yet he dwelt intact, only
issuing orders occasionally--orders that promoted the comfort of
his guests.&#160; He inquired after her hand; he set her to pour
out the coffee and Mrs. Warrington to pour out the tea.&#160; When
Evie came down there was a moment's awkwardness, and both ladies
rose to vacate their places.&#160; "Burton," called Henry, "serve
tea and coffee from the side-board!"&#160; It wasn't genuine tact,
but it was tact, of a sort--the sort that is as useful as the
genuine, and saves even more situations at Board meetings.&#160;
Henry treated a marriage like a funeral, item by item, never
raising his eyes to the whole, and "Death, where is thy
sting?&#160; Love, where is thy victory?" one would exclaim at the
close.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After breakfast she claimed a few words
with him.&#160; It was always best to approach him formally.&#160;
She asked for the interview, because he was going on to shoot
grouse tomorrow, and she was returning to Helen in town.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Certainly, dear," said he.&#160; "Of
course, I have the time.&#160; What do you want?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Nothing."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I was afraid something had gone
wrong."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No; I have nothing to say, but you may
talk."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Glancing at his watch, he talked of the
nasty curve at the lych-gate.&#160; She heard him with
interest.&#160; Her surface could always respond to his without
contempt, though all her deeper being might be yearning to help
him.&#160; She had abandoned any plan of action.&#160; Love is the
best, and the more she let herself love him, the more chance was
there that he would set his soul in order.&#160; Such a moment as
this, when they sat under fair weather by the walks of their future
home, was so sweet to her that its sweetness would surely pierce to
him.&#160; Each lift of his eyes, each parting of the thatched lip
from the clean-shaven, must prelude the tenderness that kills the
Monk and the Beast at a single blow.&#160; Disappointed a hundred
times, she still hoped.&#160; She loved him with too clear a vision
to fear his cloudiness.&#160; Whether he droned trivialities, as
today, or sprang kisses on her in the twilight, she could pardon
him, she could respond.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If there is this nasty curve," she
suggested, "couldn't we walk to the church?&#160; Not, of course,
you and Evie; but the rest of us might very well go on first, and
that would mean fewer carriages."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"One can't have ladies walking through the
Market Square.&#160; The Fussells wouldn't like it; they were
awfully particular at Charles's wedding.&#160; My--she--one of our
party was anxious to walk, and certainly the church was just round
the corner, and I shouldn't have minded; but the Colonel made a
great point of it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You men shouldn't be so chivalrous," said
Margaret thoughtfully.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why not?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She knew why not, but said that she did not
know.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He then announced that, unless she had
anything special to say, he must visit the wine-cellar, and they
went off together in search of Burton.&#160; Though clumsy and a
little inconvenient, Oniton was a genuine country house.&#160; They
clattered down flagged passages, looking into room after room, and
scaring unknown maids from the performance of obscure duties.&#160;
The wedding-breakfast must be in readiness when they came back from
church, and tea would be served in the garden.&#160; The sight of
so many agitated and serious people made Margaret smile, but she
reflected that they were paid to be serious, and enjoyed being
agitated.&#160; Here were the lower wheels of the machine that was
tossing Evie up into nuptial glory.&#160; A little boy blocked
their way with pig-tails.&#160; His mind could not grasp their
greatness, and he said: "By your leave; let me pass, please." Henry
asked him where Burton was.&#160; But the servants were so new that
they did not know one another's names.&#160; In the still-room sat
the band, who had stipulated for champagne as part of their fee,
and who were already drinking beer.&#160; Scents of Araby came from
the kitchen, mingled with cries.&#160; Margaret knew what had
happened there, for it happened at Wickham Place.&#160; One of the
wedding dishes had boiled over, and the cook was throwing
cedar-shavings to hide the smell.&#160; At last they came upon the
butler.&#160; Henry gave him the keys, and handed Margaret down the
cellar-stairs.&#160; Two doors were unlocked.&#160; She, who kept
all her wine at the bottom of the linen-cupboard, was astonished at
the sight.&#160; "We shall never get through it!" she cried, and
the two men were suddenly drawn into brotherhood, and exchanged
smiles.&#160; She felt as if she had again jumped out of the car
while it was moving.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Certainly Oniton would take some
digesting.&#160; It would be no small business to remain herself,
and yet to assimilate such an establishment.&#160; She must remain
herself, for his sake as well as her own, since a shadowy wife
degrades the husband whom she accompanies; and she must assimilate
for reasons of common honesty, since she had no right to marry a
man and make him uncomfortable.&#160; Her only ally was the power
of Home.&#160; The loss of Wickham Place had taught her more than
its possession.&#160; Howards End had repeated the lesson.&#160;
She was determined to create new sanctities among these
hills.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After visiting the wine-cellar, she
dressed, and then came the wedding, which seemed a small affair
when compared with the preparations for it.&#160; Everything went
like one o'clock.&#160; Mr. Cahill materialized out of space, and
was waiting for his bride at the church door.&#160; No one dropped
the ring or mispronounced the responses, or trod on Evie's train,
or cried.&#160; In a few minutes--the clergymen performed their
duty, the register was signed, and they were back in their
carriages, negotiating the dangerous curve by the lych-gate.&#160;
Margaret was convinced that they had not been married at all, and
that the Norman church had been intent all the time on other
business.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There were more documents to sign at the
house, and the breakfast to eat, and then a few more people dropped
in for the garden party.&#160; There had been a great many
refusals, and after all it was not a very big affair--not as big as
Margaret's would be.&#160; She noted the dishes and the strips of
red carpet, that outwardly she might give Henry what was
proper.&#160; But inwardly she hoped for something better than this
blend of Sunday church and fox-hunting.&#160; If only someone had
been upset!&#160; But this wedding had gone off so particularly
well--"quite like a Durbar" in the opinion of Lady Edser, and she
thoroughly agreed with her.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So the wasted day lumbered forward, the
bride and bridegroom drove off, yelling with laughter, and for the
second time the sun retreated towards the hills of Wales.&#160;
Henry, who was more tired than he owned, came up to her in the
castle meadow, and, in tones of unusual softness, said that he was
pleased.&#160; Everything had gone off so well.&#160; She felt that
he was praising her, too, and blushed; certainly she had done all
she could with his intractable friends, and had made a special
point of kowtowing to the men.&#160; They were breaking camp this
evening: only the Warringtons and quiet child would stay the night,
and the others were already moving towards the house to finish
their packing.&#160; "I think it did go off well," she
agreed.&#160; "Since I had to jump out of the motor, I'm thankful I
lighted on my left hand.&#160; I am so very glad about it, Henry
dear; I only hope that the guests at ours may be half as
comfortable.&#160; You must all remember that we have no practical
person among us, except my aunt, and she is not used to
entertainments on a large scale."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I know," he said gravely.&#160; "Under the
circumstances, it would be better to put everything into the hands
of Harrod's or Whiteley's, or even to go to some hotel."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You desire a hotel?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, because--well, I mustn't interfere
with you.&#160; No doubt you want to be married from your old
home."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"My old home's falling into pieces,
Henry.&#160; I only want my new.&#160; Isn't it a perfect
evening--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The Alexandrina isn't bad--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The Alexandrina," she echoed, more
occupied with the threads of smoke that were issuing from their
chimneys, and ruling the sunlit slopes with parallels of
grey.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's off Curzon Street."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Is it?&#160; Let's be married from off
Curzon Street."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then she turned westward, to gaze at the
swirling gold.&#160; Just where the river rounded the hill the sun
caught it.&#160; Fairyland must lie above the bend, and its
precious liquid was pouring towards them past Charles's
bathing-shed.&#160; She gazed so long that her eyes were dazzled,
and when they moved back to the house, she could not recognize the
faces of people who were coming out of it.&#160; A parlour-maid was
preceding them.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Who are those people?" she asked.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"They're callers!" exclaimed Henry.&#160;
"It's too late for callers."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Perhaps they're town people who want to
see the wedding presents."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'm not at home yet to townees."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, hide among the ruins, and if I can
stop them, I will."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He thanked her.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret went forward, smiling
socially.&#160; She supposed that these were unpunctual guests, who
would have to be content with vicarious civility, since Evie and
Charles were gone, Henry tired, and the others in their
rooms.&#160; She assumed the airs of a hostess; not for long.&#160;
For one of the group was Helen--Helen in her oldest clothes, and
dominated by that tense, wounding excitement that had made her a
terror in their nursery days.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What is it?" she called.&#160; "Oh, what's
wrong?&#160; Is Tibby ill?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen spoke to her two companions, who fell
back.&#160; Then she bore forward furiously.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"They're starving!" she shouted.&#160; "I
found them starving!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Who?&#160; Why have you come?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The Basts."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, Helen!" moaned Margaret.&#160;
"Whatever have you done now?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He has lost his place.&#160; He has been
turned out of his bank.&#160; Yes, he's done for.&#160; We upper
classes have ruined him, and I suppose you'll tell me it's the
battle of life.&#160; Starving.&#160; His wife is ill.&#160;
Starving.&#160; She fainted in the train."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Helen, are you mad?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Perhaps.&#160; Yes.&#160; If you like, I'm
mad.&#160; But I've brought them.&#160; I'll stand injustice no
longer.&#160; I'll show up the wretchedness that lies under this
luxury, this talk of impersonal forces, this cant about God doing
what we're too slack to do ourselves."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Have you actually brought two starving
people from London to Shropshire, Helen?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen was checked.&#160; She had not
thought of this, and her hysteria abated.&#160; "There was a
restaurant car on the train," she said.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Don't be absurd.&#160; They aren't
starving, and you know it.&#160; Now, begin from the
beginning.&#160; I won't have such theatrical nonsense.&#160; How
dare you!&#160; Yes, how dare you!" she repeated, as anger filled
her, "bursting in to Evie's wedding in this heartless way.&#160; My
goodness!&#160; but you've a perverted notion of
philanthropy.&#160; Look"--she indicated the house--"servants,
people out of the windows.&#160; They think it's some vulgar
scandal, and I must explain, 'Oh no, it's only my sister screaming,
and only two hangers-on of ours, whom she has brought here for no
conceivable reason.'"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Kindly take back that word 'hangers-on,'"
said Helen, ominously calm.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Very well," conceded Margaret, who for all
her wrath was determined to avoid a real quarrel.&#160; "I, too, am
sorry about them, but it beats me why you've brought them here, or
why you're here yourself.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's our last chance of seeing Mr.
Wilcox."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret moved towards the house at
this.&#160; She was determined not to worry Henry.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He's going to Scotland.&#160; I know he
is.&#160; I insist on seeing him."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, tomorrow."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I knew it was our last chance."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How do you do, Mr. Bast?" said Margaret,
trying to control her voice.&#160; "This is an odd business.&#160;
What view do you take of it?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There is Mrs. Bast, too," prompted
Helen.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Jacky also shook hands.&#160; She, like her
husband, was shy, and, furthermore, ill, and furthermore, so
bestially stupid that she could not grasp what was happening.&#160;
She only knew that the lady had swept down like a whirlwind last
night, had paid the rent, redeemed the furniture, provided them
with a dinner and breakfast, and ordered them to meet her at
Paddington next morning.&#160; Leonard had feebly protested, and
when the morning came, had suggested that they shouldn't go.&#160;
But she, half mesmerized, had obeyed.&#160; The lady had told them
to, and they must, and their bed-sitting-room had accordingly
changed into Paddington, and Paddington into a railway carriage,
that shook, and grew hot, and grew cold, and vanished entirely, and
reappeared amid torrents of expensive scent.&#160; "You have
fainted," said the lady in an awe-struck voice.&#160; "Perhaps the
air will do you good." And perhaps it had, for here she was,
feeling rather better among a lot of flowers.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'm sure I don't want to intrude," began
Leonard, in answer to Margaret's question.&#160; "But you have been
so kind to me in the past in warning me about the Porphyrion that I
wondered--why, I wondered whether--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Whether we could get him back into the
Porphyrion again," supplied Helen.&#160; "Meg, this has been a
cheerful business.&#160; A bright evening's work that was on
Chelsea Embankment."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret shook her head and returned to Mr.
Bast.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't understand.&#160; You left the
Porphyrion because we suggested it was a bad concern, didn't
you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's right."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And went into a bank instead?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I told you all that," said Helen; "and
they reduced their staff after he had been in a month, and now he's
penniless, and I consider that we and our informant are directly to
blame."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I hate all this," Leonard muttered.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I hope you do, Mr. Bast.&#160; But it's no
good mincing matters.&#160; You have done yourself no good by
coming here.&#160; If you intend to confront Mr. Wilcox, and to
call him to account for a chance remark, you will make a very great
mistake."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I brought them.&#160; I did it all," cried
Helen.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I can only advise you to go at once.&#160;
My sister has put you in a false position, and it is kindest to
tell you so.&#160; It's too late to get to town, but you'll find a
comfortable hotel in Oniton, where Mrs. Bast can rest, and I hope
you'll be my guests there."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That isn't what I want, Miss Schlegel,"
said Leonard.&#160; "You're very kind, and no doubt it's a false
position, but you make me miserable.&#160; I seem no good at
all."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's work he wants," interpreted
Helen.&#160; "Can't you see?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then he said: "Jacky, let's go.&#160; We're
more bother than we're worth.&#160; We're costing these ladies
pounds and pounds already to get work for us, and they never
will.&#160; There's nothing we're good enough to do."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We would like to find you work," said
Margaret rather conventionally.&#160; "We want to--I, like my
sister.&#160; You're only down in your luck.&#160; Go to the hotel,
have a good night's rest, and some day you shall pay me back the
bill, if you prefer it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Leonard was near the abyss, and at such
moments men see clearly.&#160; "You don't know what you're talking
about," he said.&#160; "I shall never get work now.&#160; If rich
people fail at one profession, they can try another.&#160; Not
I.&#160; I had my groove, and I've got out of it.&#160; I could do
one particular branch of insurance in one particular office well
enough to command a salary, but that's all.&#160; Poetry's nothing,
Miss Schlegel.&#160; One's thoughts about this and that are
nothing.&#160; Your money, too, is nothing, if you'll understand
me.&#160; I mean if a man over twenty once loses his own particular
job, it's all over with him.&#160; I have seen it happen to
others.&#160; Their friends gave them money for a little, but in
the end they fall over the edge.&#160; It's no good.&#160; It's the
whole world pulling.&#160; There always will be rich and
poor."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He ceased.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Won't you have something to eat?" said
Margaret.&#160; "I don't know what to do.&#160; It isn't my house,
and though Mr. Wilcox would have been glad to see you at any other
time--as I say, I don't know what to do, but I undertake to do what
I can for you.&#160; Helen, offer them something.&#160; Do try a
sandwich, Mrs. Bast."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They moved to a long table behind which a
servant was still standing.&#160; Iced cakes, sandwiches
innumerable, coffee, claret-cup, champagne, remained almost intact:
their overfed guests could do no more.&#160; Leonard refused.&#160;
Jacky thought she could manage a little.&#160; Margaret left them
whispering together and had a few more words with Helen.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She said: "Helen, I like Mr. Bast.&#160; I
agree that he's worth helping.&#160; I agree that we are directly
responsible."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, indirectly.&#160; Via Mr.
Wilcox."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Let me tell you once for all that if you
take up that attitude, I'll do nothing.&#160; No doubt you're right
logically, and are entitled to say a great many scathing things
about Henry.&#160; Only, I won't have it.&#160; So choose.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen looked at the sunset.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If you promise to take them quietly to the
George, I will speak to Henry about them--in my own way, mind;
there is to be none of this absurd screaming about justice.&#160; I
have no use for justice.&#160; If it was only a question of money,
we could do it ourselves.&#160; But he wants work, and that we
can't give him, but possibly Henry can."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's his duty to," grumbled Helen.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Nor am I concerned with duty.&#160; I'm
concerned with the characters of various people whom we know, and
how, things being as they are, things may be made a little
better.&#160; Mr. Wilcox hates being asked favours: all business
men do.&#160; But I am going to ask him, at the risk of a rebuff,
because I want to make things a little better."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Very well.&#160; I promise.&#160; You take
it very calmly.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Take them off to the George, then, and
I'll try.&#160; Poor creatures!&#160; but they look tried."&#160;
As they parted, she added: "I haven't nearly done with you, though,
Helen.&#160; You have been most self-indulgent.&#160; I can't get
over it.&#160; You have less restraint rather than more as you grow
older.&#160; Think it over and alter yourself, or we shan't have
happy lives."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She rejoined Henry.&#160; Fortunately he
had been sitting down: these physical matters were important.&#160;
"Was it townees?" he asked, greeting her with a pleasant
smile.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You'll never believe me," said Margaret,
sitting down beside him.&#160; "It's all right now, but it was my
sister."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Helen here?" he cried, preparing to
rise.&#160; "But she refused the invitation.&#160; I thought she
despised weddings."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Don't get up.&#160; She has not come to
the wedding.&#160; I've bundled her off to the George."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Inherently hospitable, he protested.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No; she has two of her prot&#233;g&#233;s
with her, and must keep with them."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Let 'em all come."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"My dear Henry, did you see them?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I did catch sight of a brown bunch of a
woman, certainly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The brown bunch was Helen, but did you
catch sight of a sea-green and salmon bunch?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What!&#160; are they out
beanfeasting?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No; business.&#160; They wanted to see me,
and later on I want to talk to you about them."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She was ashamed of her own diplomacy.&#160;
In dealing with a Wilcox, how tempting it was to lapse from
comradeship, and to give him the kind of woman that he
desired!&#160; Henry took the hint at once, and said: "Why later
on?&#160; Tell me now.&#160; No time like the present."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Shall I?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If it isn't a long story."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, not five minutes; but there's a sting
at the end of it, for I want you to find the man some work in your
office."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What are his qualifications?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't know.&#160; He's a clerk."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How old?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Twenty-five, perhaps."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What's his name?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Bast," said Margaret, and was about to
remind him that they had met at Wickham Place, but stopped
herself.&#160; It had not been a successful meeting.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Where was he before?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Dempster's Bank."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why did he leave?" he asked, still
remembering nothing.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"They reduced their staff."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"All right; I'll see him."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was the reward of her tact and devotion
through the day.&#160; Now she understood why some women prefer
influence to rights.&#160; Mrs. Plynlimmon, when condemning
suffragettes, had said: "The woman who can't influence her husband
to vote the way she wants ought to be ashamed of herself."&#160;
Margaret had winced, but she was influencing Henry now, and though
pleased at her little victory, she knew that she had won it by the
methods of the harem.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I should be glad if you took him," she
said, "but I don't know whether he's qualified."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'll do what I can.&#160; But, Margaret,
this mustn't be taken as a precedent."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, of course--of course--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I can't fit in your prot&#233;g&#233;s
every day.&#160; Business would suffer."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I can promise you he's the last.&#160;
He--he's rather a special case."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Prot&#233;g&#233;s always are."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She let it stand at that.&#160; He rose
with a little extra touch of complacency, and held out his hand to
help her up.&#160; How wide the gulf between Henry as he was and
Henry as Helen thought he ought to be!&#160; And she
herself--hovering as usual between the two, now accepting men as
they are, now yearning with her sister for Truth.&#160; Love and
Truth--their warfare seems eternal.&#160; Perhaps the whole visible
world rests on it, and if they were one, life itself, like the
spirits when Prospero was reconciled to his brother, might vanish
into air, into thin air.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Your prot&#233;g&#233; has made us late,"
said he.&#160; "The Fussells will just be starting."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the whole she sided with men as they
are.&#160; Henry would save the Basts as he had saved Howards End,
while Helen and her friends were discussing the ethics of
salvation.&#160; His was a slap-dash method, but the world has been
built slap-dash, and the beauty of mountain and river and sunset
may be but the varnish with which the unskilled artificer hides his
joins.&#160; Oniton, like herself, was imperfect.&#160; Its
apple-trees were stunted, its castle ruinous.&#160; It, too, had
suffered in the border warfare between the Anglo Saxon and the
Kelt, between things as they are and as they ought to be.&#160;
Once more the west was retreating, once again the orderly stars
were dotting the eastern sky.&#160; There is certainly no rest for
us on the earth.&#160; But there is happiness, and as Margaret
descended the mound on her lover's arm, she felt that she was
having her share.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To her annoyance, Mrs. Bast was still in
the garden; the husband and Helen had left her there to finish her
meal while they went to engage rooms.&#160; Margaret found this
woman repellent.&#160; She had felt, when shaking her hand, an
overpowering shame.&#160; She remembered the motive of her call at
Wickham Place, and smelt again odours from the abyss--odours the
more disturbing because they were involuntary.&#160; For there was
no malice in Jacky.&#160; There she sat, a piece of cake in one
hand, an empty champagne glass in the other, doing no harm to
anybody.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She's overtired," Margaret
whispered.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She's something else," said Henry.&#160;
"This won't do.&#160; I can't have her in my garden in this
state."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Is she--" Margaret hesitated to add
"drunk." Now that she was going to marry him, he had grown
particular.&#160; He discountenanced risqu&#233; conversations
now.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Henry went up to the woman.&#160; She
raised her face, which gleamed in the twilight like a
puff-ball.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Madam, you will be more comfortable at the
hotel," he said sharply.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Jacky replied: "If it isn't Hen!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ne crois pas que le mari lui ressemble,"
apologized Margaret.&#160; "Il est tout &#224; fait
diff&#233;rent."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Henry!" she repeated, quite
distinctly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Wilcox was much annoyed.&#160; "I can't
congratulate you on your prot&#233;g&#233;s," he remarked.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Hen, don't go.&#160; You do love me, dear,
don't you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Bless us, what a person!" sighed Margaret,
gathering up her skirts.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Jacky pointed with her cake.&#160; "You're
a nice boy, you are." She yawned.&#160; "There now, I love
you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Henry, I am awfully sorry."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And pray why?" he asked, and looked at her
so sternly that she feared he was ill.&#160; He seemed more
scandalized than the facts demanded.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"To have brought this down on you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Pray don't apologize."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The voice continued.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why does she call you 'Hen'?" said
Margaret innocently.&#160; "Has she ever seen you before?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Seen Hen before!" said Jacky.&#160; "Who
hasn't seen Hen?&#160; He's serving you like me, my dear.&#160;
These boys!&#160; You wait--Still we love 'em."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Are you now satisfied?" Henry asked.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret began to grow frightened.&#160; "I
don't know what it is all about," she said.&#160; "Let's come
in."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But he thought she was acting.&#160; He
thought he was trapped.&#160; He saw his whole life
crumbling.&#160; "Don't you indeed?" he said bitingly.&#160; "I
do.&#160; Allow me to congratulate you on the success of your
plan."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"This is Helen's plan, not mine."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I now understand your interest in the
Basts.&#160; Very well thought out.&#160; I am amused at your
caution, Margaret.&#160; You are quite right--it was
necessary.&#160; I am a man, and have lived a man's past.&#160; I
have the honour to release you from your engagement."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still she could not understand.&#160; She
knew of life's seamy side as a theory; she could not grasp it as a
fact.&#160; More words from Jacky were necessary--words
unequivocal, undenied.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So that--" burst from her, and she went
indoors.&#160; She stopped herself from saying more.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So what?" asked Colonel Fussell, who was
getting ready to start in the hall.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We were saying--Henry and I were just
having the fiercest argument, my point being--" Seizing his fur
coat from a footman, she offered to help him on.&#160; He
protested, and there was a playful little scene.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, let me do that," said Henry,
following.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Thanks so much!&#160; You see--he has
forgiven me!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Colonel said gallantly: "I don't expect
there's much to forgive.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He got into the car.&#160; The ladies
followed him after an interval.&#160; Maids, courier, and heavier
luggage had been sent on earlier by the branch--line.&#160; Still
chattering, still thanking their host and patronizing their future
hostess, the guests were home away.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then Margaret continued: "So that woman has
been your mistress?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You put it with your usual delicacy," he
replied.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"When, please?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"When, please?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ten years ago."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She left him without a word.&#160; For it
was not her tragedy: it was Mrs. Wilcox's.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 27</h3>
<p>Helen began to wonder why she had spent a matter of eight pounds
in making some people ill and others angry.&#160; Now that the wave
of excitement was ebbing, and had left her, Mr. Bast, and Mrs. Bast
stranded for the night in a Shropshire hotel, she asked herself
what forces had made the wave flow.&#160; At all events, no harm
was done.&#160; Margaret would play the game properly now, and
though Helen disapproved of her sister's methods, she knew that the
Basts would benefit by them in the long run.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Mr. Wilcox is so illogical," she explained
to Leonard, who had put his wife to bed, and was sitting with her
in the empty coffee-room.&#160; "If we told him it was his duty to
take you on, he might refuse to do it.&#160; The fact is, he isn't
properly educated.&#160; I don't want to set you against him, but
you'll find him a trial."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I can never thank you sufficiently, Miss
Schlegel," was all that Leonard felt equal to.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I believe in personal
responsibility.&#160; Don't you?&#160; And in personal
everything.&#160; I hate--I suppose I oughtn't to say that--but the
Wilcoxes are on the wrong tack surely.&#160; Or perhaps it isn't
their fault.&#160; Perhaps the little thing that says 'I' is
missing out of the middle of their heads, and then it's a waste of
time to blame them.&#160; There's a nightmare of a theory that says
a special race is being born which will rule the rest of us in the
future just because it lacks the little thing that says 'I.' Had
you heard that?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I get no time for reading."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Had you thought it, then?&#160; That there
are two kinds of people--our kind, who live straight from the
middle of their heads, and the other kind who can't, because their
heads have no middle?&#160; They can't say 'I.' They
<em>aren't</em> in fact, and so they're supermen.&#160; Pierpont
Morgan has never said 'I' in his life."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leonard roused himself.&#160; If his
benefactress wanted intellectual conversation, she must have
it.&#160; She was more important than his ruined past.&#160; "I
never got on to Nietzsche," he said.&#160; "But I always understood
that those supermen were rather what you may call egoists."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, no, that's wrong," replied
Helen.&#160; "No superman ever said 'I want,' because 'I want' must
lead to the question, 'Who am I?' and so to Pity and to
Justice.&#160; He only says 'want.' 'Want Europe,' if he's
Napoleon; 'want wives,' if he's Bluebeard; 'want Botticelli,' if
he's Pierpont Morgan.&#160; Never the 'I'; and if you could pierce
through him, you'd find panic and emptiness in the middle."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leonard was silent for a moment.&#160; Then
he said: "May I take it, Miss Schlegel, that you and I are both the
sort that say 'I'?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Of course."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And your sister too?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Of course," repeated Helen, a little
sharply.&#160; She was annoyed with Margaret, but did not want her
discussed.&#160; "All presentable people say 'I.'"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But Mr. Wilcox--he is not perhaps--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't know that it's any good discussing
Mr. Wilcox either."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Quite so, quite so," he agreed.&#160;
Helen asked herself why she had snubbed him.&#160; Once or twice
during the day she had encouraged him to criticize, and then had
pulled him up short.&#160; Was she afraid of him presuming?&#160;
If so, it was disgusting of her.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But he was thinking the snub quite
natural.&#160; Everything she did was natural, and incapable of
causing offence.&#160; While the Miss Schlegels were together he
had felt them scarcely human--a sort of admonitory whirligig.&#160;
But a Miss Schlegel alone was different.&#160; She was in Helen's
case unmarried, in Margaret's about to be married, in neither case
an echo of her sister.&#160; A light had fallen at last into this
rich upper world, and he saw that it was full of men and women,
some of whom were more friendly to him than others.&#160; Helen had
become "his" Miss Schlegel, who scolded him and corresponded with
him, and had swept down yesterday with grateful vehemence.&#160;
Margaret, though not unkind, was severe and remote.&#160; He would
not presume to help her, for instance.&#160; He had never liked
her, and began to think that his original impression was true, and
that her sister did not like her either.&#160; Helen was certainly
lonely.&#160; She, who gave away so much, was receiving too
little.&#160; Leonard was pleased to think that he could spare her
vexation by holding his tongue and concealing what he knew about
Mr. Wilcox.&#160; Jacky had announced her discovery when he fetched
her from the lawn.&#160; After the first shock, he did not mind for
himself.&#160; By now he had no illusions about his wife, and this
was only one new stain on the face of a love that had never been
pure.&#160; To keep perfection perfect, that should be his ideal,
if the future gave him time to have ideals.&#160; Helen, and
Margaret for Helen's sake, must not know.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen disconcerted him by fuming the
conversation to his wife.&#160; "Mrs. Bast--does she ever say 'I'?"
she asked, half mischievously, and then, "Is she very tired?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's better she stops in her room," said
Leonard.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Shall I sit up with her?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, thank you; she does not need
company."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Mr. Bast, what kind of woman is your
wife?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leonard blushed up to his eyes.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You ought to know my ways by now.&#160;
Does that question offend you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, oh no, Miss Schlegel, no."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Because I love honesty.&#160; Don't
pretend your marriage has been a happy one.&#160; You and she can
have nothing in common."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He did not deny it, but said shyly: "I
suppose that's pretty obvious; but Jacky never meant to do anybody
any harm.&#160; When things went wrong, or I heard things, I used
to think it was her fault, but, looking back, it's more mine.&#160;
I needn't have married her, but as I have I must stick to her and
keep her."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How long have you been married?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Nearly three years."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What did your people say?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"They will not have anything to do with
us.&#160; They had a sort of family council when they heard I was
married, and cut us off altogether."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen began to pace up and down the
room.&#160; "My good boy, what a mess!" she said gently.&#160; "Who
are your people?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He could answer this.&#160; His parents,
who were dead, had been in trade; his sisters had married
commercial travellers; his brother was a lay-reader.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And your grandparents?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leonard told her a secret that he had held
shameful up to now.&#160; "They were just nothing at all," he said,
"--agricultural labourers and that sort."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So!&#160; From which part?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Lincolnshire mostly, but my mother's
father--he, oddly enough, came from these parts round here."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"From this very Shropshire.&#160; Yes, that
is odd.&#160; My mother's people were Lancashire.&#160; But why do
your brother and your sisters object to Mrs. Bast?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, I don't know."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Excuse me, you do know.&#160; I am not a
baby.&#160; I can bear anything you tell me, and the more you tell
the more I shall be able to help.&#160; Have they heard anything
against her?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He was silent.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I think I have guessed now," said Helen
very gravely.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't think so, Miss Schlegel; I hope
not."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We must be honest, even over these
things.&#160; I have guessed.&#160; I am frightfully, dreadfully
sorry, but it does not make the least difference to me.&#160; I
shall feel just the same to both of you.&#160; I blame, not your
wife for these things, but men."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leonard left it at that--so long as she did
not guess the man.&#160; She stood at the window and slowly pulled
up the blinds.&#160; The hotel looked over a dark square.&#160; The
mists had begun.&#160; When she turned back to him her eyes were
shining.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Don't you worry," he pleaded.&#160; "I
can't bear that.&#160; We shall be all right if I get work.&#160;
If I could only get work--something regular to do.&#160; Then it
wouldn't be so bad again.&#160; I don't trouble after books as I
used.&#160; I can imagine that with regular work we should settle
down again.&#160; It stops one thinking.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Settle down to what?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, just settle down."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And that's to be life!" said Helen, with a
catch in her throat.&#160; "How can you, with all the beautiful
things to see and do--with music--with walking at night--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Walking is well enough when a man's in
work," he answered.&#160; "Oh, I did talk a lot of nonsense once,
but there's nothing like a bailiff in the house to drive it out of
you.&#160; When I saw him fingering my Ruskins and Stevensons, I
seemed to see life straight real, and it isn't a pretty
sight.&#160; My books are back again, thanks to you, but they'll
never be the same to me again, and I shan't ever again think night
in the woods is wonderful."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why not?" asked Helen, throwing up the
window.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Because I see one must have money."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, you're wrong."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I wish I was wrong, but--the clergyman--he
has money of his own, or else he's paid; the poet or the
musician--just the same; the tramp--he's no different.&#160; The
tramp goes to the workhouse in the end, and is paid for with other
people's money.&#160; Miss Schlegel, the real thing's money and all
the rest is a dream."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You're still wrong.&#160; You've forgotten
Death."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leonard could not understand.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If we lived for ever what you say would be
true.&#160; But we have to die, we have to leave life
presently.&#160; Injustice and greed would be the real thing if we
lived for ever.&#160; As it is, we must hold to other things,
because Death is coming.&#160; I love Death--not morbidly, but
because He explains.&#160; He shows me the emptiness of
Money.&#160; Death and Money are the eternal foes.&#160; Not Death
and Life.&#160; Never mind what lies behind Death, Mr. Bast, but be
sure that the poet and the musician and the tramp will be happier
in it than the man who has never learnt to say, 'I am I.'"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I wonder."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We are all in a mist--I know but I can
help you this far--men like the Wilcoxes are deeper in the mist
than any.&#160; Sane, sound Englishmen!&#160; building up empires,
levelling all the world into what they call common sense.&#160; But
mention Death to them and they're offended, because Death's really
Imperial, and He cries out against them for ever."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I am as afraid of Death as any one."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But not of the idea of Death."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But what is the difference?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Infinite difference," said Helen, more
gravely than before.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leonard looked at her wondering, and had
the sense of great things sweeping out of the shrouded night.&#160;
But he could not receive them, because his heart was still full of
little things.&#160; As the lost umbrella had spoilt the concert at
Queen's Hall, so the lost situation was obscuring the diviner
harmonies now.&#160; Death, Life and Materialism were fine words,
but would Mr. Wilcox take him on as a clerk?&#160; Talk as one
would, Mr. Wilcox was king of this world, the superman, with his
own morality, whose head remained in the clouds.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I must be stupid," he said
apologetically.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While to Helen the paradox became clearer
and clearer.&#160; "Death destroys a man: the idea of Death saves
him." Behind the coffins and the skeletons that stay the vulgar
mind lies something so immense that all that is great in us
responds to it.&#160; Men of the world may recoil from the
charnel-house that they will one day enter, but Love knows
better.&#160; Death is his foe, but his peer, and in their age-long
struggle the thews of Love have been strengthened, and his vision
cleared, until there is no one who can stand against him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So never give in," continued the girl, and
restated again and again the vague yet convincing plea that the
Invisible lodges against the Visible.&#160; Her excitement grew as
she tried to cut the rope that fastened Leonard to the earth.&#160;
Woven of bitter experience, it resisted her.&#160; Presently the
waitress entered and gave her a letter from Margaret.&#160; Another
note, addressed to Leonard, was inside.&#160; They read them,
listening to the murmurings of the river.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 28</h3>
<p>For many hours Margaret did nothing; then she controlled
herself, and wrote some letters.&#160; She was too bruised to speak
to Henry; she could pity him, and even determine to marry him, but
as yet all lay too deep in her heart for speech.&#160; On the
surface the sense of his degradation was too strong.&#160; She
could not command voice or look, and the gentle words that she
forced out through her pen seemed to proceed from some other
person.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"My dearest boy," she began, "this is not
to part us.&#160; It is everything or nothing, and I mean it to be
nothing.&#160; It happened long before we ever met, and even if it
had happened since, I should be writing the same, I hope.&#160; I
do understand."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But she crossed out "I do understand"; it
struck a false note.&#160; Henry could not bear to be
understood.&#160; She also crossed out, "It is everything or
nothing.&#160; "Henry would resent so strong a grasp of the
situation.&#160; She must not comment; comment is unfeminine.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I think that'll about do," she
thought.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then the sense of his degradation choked
her.&#160; Was he worth all this bother?&#160; To have yielded to a
woman of that sort was everything, yes, it was, and she could not
be his wife.&#160; She tried to translate his temptation into her
own language, and her brain reeled.&#160; Men must be different,
even to want to yield to such a temptation.&#160; Her belief in
comradeship was stifled, and she saw life as from that glass saloon
on the Great Western, which sheltered male and female alike from
the fresh air.&#160; Are the sexes really races, each with its own
code of morality, and their mutual love a mere device of Nature to
keep things going?&#160; Strip human intercourse of the
proprieties, and is it reduced to this?&#160; Her judgment told her
no.&#160; She knew that out of Nature's device we have built a
magic that will win us immortality.&#160; Far more mysterious than
the call of sex to sex is the tenderness that we throw into that
call; far wider is the gulf between us and the farmyard than
between the farm-yard and the garbage that nourishes it.&#160; We
are evolving, in ways that Science cannot measure, to ends that
Theology dares not contemplate.&#160; "Men did produce one jewel,"
the gods will say, and, saying, will give us immortality.&#160;
Margaret knew all this, but for the moment she could not feel it,
and transformed the marriage of Evie and Mr. Cahill into a carnival
of fools, and her own marriage--too miserable to think of that, she
tore up the letter, and then wrote another:</p>
<blockquote><strong><em>Dear Mr. Bast,<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I have spoken to Mr. Wilcox about you, as I
promised, and am sorry to say that he has no vacancy for
you.</em></strong><br />
<div align="right"><strong><em>Yours truly,<br />
M. J. Schlegel</em></strong></div>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She enclosed this in a note to Helen,
over which she took less trouble than she might have done; but her
head was aching, and she could not stop to pick her words:</p>
<blockquote><strong><em>Dear Helen,<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Give him this.&#160; The Basts are no
good.&#160; Henry found the woman drunk on the lawn.&#160; I am
having a room got ready for you here, and will you please come
round at once on getting this?&#160; The Basts are not at all the
type we should trouble about.&#160; I may go round to them myself
in the morning, and do anything that is fair.</em></strong><br />
<div align="right"><strong><em>M</em></strong></div>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In writing this, Margaret felt that she
was being practical.&#160; Something might be arranged for the
Basts later on, but they must be silenced for the moment.&#160; She
hoped to avoid a conversation between the woman and Helen.&#160;
She rang the bell for a servant, but no one answered it; Mr. Wilcox
and the Warringtons were gone to bed, and the kitchen was abandoned
to Saturnalia.&#160; Consequently she went over to the George
herself.&#160; She did not enter the hotel, for discussion would
have been perilous, and, saying that the letter was important, she
gave it to the waitress.&#160; As she recrossed the square she saw
Helen and Mr. Bast looking out of the window of the coffee-room,
and feared she was already too late.&#160; Her task was not yet
over; she ought to tell Henry what she had done.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This came easily, for she saw him in the
hall.&#160; The night wind had been rattling the pictures against
the wall, and the noise had disturbed him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Who's there?" he called, quite the
householder.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret walked in and past him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I have asked Helen to sleep," she
said.&#160; "She is best here; so don't lock the front-door."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I thought someone had got in," said
Henry.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"At the same time I told the man that we
could do nothing for him.&#160; I don't know about later, but now
the Basts must clearly go."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Did you say that your sister is sleeping
here, after all?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Probably."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Is she to be shown up to your room?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I have naturally nothing to say to her; I
am going to bed.&#160; Will you tell the servants about
Helen?&#160; Could someone go to carry her bag?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He tapped a little gong, which had been
bought to summon the servants.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You must make more noise than that if you
want them to hear."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Henry opened a door, and down the corridor
came shouts of laughter.&#160; "Far too much screaming there," he
said, and strode towards it.&#160; Margaret went upstairs,
uncertain whether to be glad that they had met, or sorry.&#160;
They had behaved as if nothing had happened, and her deepest
instincts told her that this was wrong.&#160; For his own sake,
some explanation was due.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And yet--what could an explanation tell
her?&#160; A date, a place, a few details, which she could imagine
all too clearly.&#160; Now that the first shock was over, she saw
that there was every reason to premise a Mrs. Bast.&#160; Henry's
inner life had long laid open to her--his intellectual confusion,
his obtuseness to personal influence, his strong but furtive
passions.&#160; Should she refuse him because his outer life
corresponded?&#160; Perhaps.&#160; Perhaps, if the dishonour had
been done to her, but it was done long before her day.&#160; She
struggled against the feeling.&#160; She told herself that Mrs.
Wilcox's wrong was her own.&#160; But she was not a bargain
theorist.&#160; As she undressed, her anger, her regard for the
dead, her desire for a scene, all grew weak.&#160; Henry must have
it as he liked, for she loved him, and some day she would use her
love to make him a better man.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pity was at the bottom of her actions all
through this crisis.&#160; Pity, if one may generalize, is at the
bottom of woman.&#160; When men like us, it is for our better
qualities, and however tender their liking, we dare not be unworthy
of it, or they will quietly let us go.&#160; But unworthiness
stimulates woman.&#160; It brings out her deeper nature, for good
or for evil.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Here was the core of the question.&#160;
Henry must be forgiven, and made better by love; nothing else
mattered.&#160; Mrs. Wilcox, that unquiet yet kindly ghost, must be
left to her own wrong.&#160; To her everything was in proportion
now, and she, too, would pity the man who was blundering up and
down their lives.&#160; Had Mrs. Wilcox known of his
trespass?&#160; An interesting question, but Margaret fell asleep,
tethered by affection, and lulled by the murmurs of the river that
descended all the night from Wales.&#160; She felt herself at one
with her future home, colouring it and coloured by it, and awoke to
see, for the second time, Oniton Castle conquering the morning
mists.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 29</h3>
<p>"Henry dear--" was her greeting.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He had finished his breakfast, and was
beginning the <em>Times</em>.&#160; His sister-in-law was
packing.&#160; She knelt by him and took the paper from him,
feeling that it was unusually heavy and thick.&#160; Then, putting
her face where it had been, she looked up in his eyes.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Henry dear, look at me.&#160; No, I won't
have you shirking.&#160; Look at me.&#160; There.&#160; That's
all."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You're referring to last evening," he said
huskily.&#160; "I have released you from your engagement.&#160; I
could find excuses, but I won't.&#160; No, I won't.&#160; A
thousand times no.&#160; I'm a bad lot, and must be left at
that."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Expelled from his old fortress, Mr. Wilcox
was building a new one.&#160; He could no longer appear respectable
to her, so he defended himself instead in a lurid past.&#160; It
was not true repentance.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Leave it where you will, boy.&#160; It's
not going to trouble us: I know what I'm talking about, and it will
make no difference."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No difference?" he inquired.&#160; "No
difference, when you find that I am not the fellow you
thought?"&#160; He was annoyed with Miss Schlegel here.&#160; He
would have preferred her to be prostrated by the blow, or even to
rage.&#160; Against the tide of his sin flowed the feeling that she
was not altogether womanly.&#160; Her eyes gazed too straight; they
had read books that are suitable for men only.&#160; And though he
had dreaded a scene, and though she had determined against one,
there was a scene, all the same.&#160; It was somehow
imperative.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I am unworthy of you," he began.&#160;
"Had I been worthy, I should not have released you from your
engagement.&#160; I know what I am talking about.&#160; I can't
bear to talk of such things.&#160; We had better leave
it.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She kissed his hand.&#160; He jerked it
from her, and, rising to his feet, went on: "You, with your
sheltered life, and refined pursuits, and friends, and books, you
and your sister, and women like you--I say, how can you guess the
temptations that lie round a man?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It is difficult for us," said Margaret;
"but if we are worth marrying, we do guess."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Cut off from decent society and family
ties, what do you suppose happens to thousands of young fellows
overseas?&#160; Isolated.&#160; No one near.&#160; I know by bitter
experience, and yet you say it makes 'no difference.'"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not to me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He laughed bitterly.&#160; Margaret went to
the side-board and helped herself to one of the breakfast
dishes.&#160; Being the last down, she turned out the spirit-lamp
that kept them warm.&#160; She was tender, but grave.&#160; She
knew that Henry was not so much confessing his soul as pointing out
the gulf between the male soul and the female, and she did not
desire to hear him on this point.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Did Helen come?" she asked.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He shook his head.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But that won't do at all, at all!&#160; We
don't want her gossiping with Mrs. Bast."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Good God!&#160; no!" he exclaimed,
suddenly natural.&#160; Then he caught himself up.&#160; "Let them
gossip.&#160; My game's up, though I thank you for your
unselfishness--little as my thanks are worth."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Didn't she send me a message or
anything?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I heard of none."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Would you ring the bell, please?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What to do?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why, to inquire."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He swaggered up to it tragically, and
sounded a peal.&#160; Margaret poured herself out some
coffee.&#160; The butler came, and said that Miss Schlegel had
slept at the George, so far as he had heard.&#160; Should he go
round to the George?&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'll go, thank you," said Margaret, and
dismissed him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It is no good," said Henry.&#160; "Those
things leak out; you cannot stop a story once it has started.&#160;
I have known cases of other men--I despised them once, I thought
that <em>I'm</em> different, I shall never be tempted.&#160; Oh,
Margaret--" He came and sat down near her, improvising
emotion.&#160; She could not bear to listen to him.&#160; "We
fellows all come to grief once in our time.&#160; Will you believe
that?&#160; There are moments when the strongest man--'Let him who
standeth, take heed lest he fall.' That's true, isn't it?&#160; If
you knew all, you would excuse me.&#160; I was far from good
influences--far even from England.&#160; I was very, very lonely,
and longed for a woman's voice.&#160; That's enough.&#160; I have
told you too much already for you to forgive me now."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, that's enough, dear."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I have"--he lowered his voice--"I have
been through hell."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Gravely she considered this claim.&#160;
Had he?&#160; Had he suffered tortures of remorse, or had it been,
"There!&#160; that's over.&#160; Now for respectable life
again"?&#160; The latter, if she read him rightly.&#160; A man who
has been through hell does not boast of his virility.&#160; He is
humble and hides it, if, indeed, it still exists.&#160; Only in
legend does the sinner come forth penitent, but terrible, to
conquer pure woman by his resistless power.&#160; Henry was anxious
to be terrible, but had not got it in him.&#160; He was a good
average Englishman, who had slipped.&#160; The really culpable
point--his faithlessness to Mrs. Wilcox--never seemed to strike
him.&#160; She longed to mention Mrs. Wilcox.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And bit by bit the story was told
her.&#160; It was a very simple story.&#160; Ten years ago was the
time, a garrison town in Cyprus the place.&#160; Now and then he
asked her whether she could possibly forgive him, and she answered,
"I have already forgiven you, Henry." She chose her words
carefully, and so saved him from panic.&#160; She played the girl,
until he could rebuild his fortress and hide his soul from the
world.&#160; When the butler came to clear away, Henry was in a
very different mood--asked the fellow what he was in such a hurry
for, complained of the noise last night in the servants'
hall.&#160; Margaret looked intently at the butler.&#160; He, as a
handsome young man, was faintly attractive to her as a woman--an
attraction so faint as scarcely to be perceptible, yet the skies
would have fallen if she had mentioned it to Henry.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On her return from the George the building
operations were complete, and the old Henry fronted her, competent,
cynical, and kind.&#160; He had made a clean breast, had been
forgiven, and the great thing now was to forget his failure, and to
send it the way of other unsuccessful investments.&#160; Jacky
rejoined Howards End and Ducie Street, and the vermilion motor-car,
and the Argentine Hard Dollars, and all the things and people for
whom he had never had much use and had less now.&#160; Their memory
hampered him.&#160; He could scarcely attend to Margaret who
brought back disquieting news from the George.&#160; Helen and her
clients had gone.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, let them go--the man and his wife, I
mean, for the more we see of your sister the better."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But they have gone separately--Helen very
early, the Basts just before I arrived.&#160; They have left no
message.&#160; They have answered neither of my notes.&#160; I
don't like to think what it all means."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What did you say in the notes?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I told you last night."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh--ah--yes!&#160; Dear, would you like
one turn in the garden?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret took his arm.&#160; The beautiful
weather soothed her.&#160; But the wheels of Evie's wedding were
still at work, tossing the guests outwards as deftly as they had
drawn them in, and she could not be with him long.&#160; It had
been arranged that they should motor to Shrewsbury, whence he would
go north, and she back to London with the Warringtons.&#160; For a
fraction of time she was happy.&#160; Then her brain
recommenced.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I am afraid there has been gossiping of
some kind at the George.&#160; Helen would not have left unless she
had heard something.&#160; I mismanaged that.&#160; It is
wretched.&#160; I ought to--have parted her from that woman at
once.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Margaret!" he exclaimed, loosing her arm
impressively.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes--yes, Henry?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I am far from a saint--in fact, the
reverse--but you have taken me, for better or worse.&#160; Bygones
must be bygones.&#160; You have promised to forgive me.&#160;
Margaret, a promise is a promise.&#160; Never mention that woman
again."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Except for some practical
reason--never."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Practical!&#160; You practical!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, I'm practical," she murmured,
stooping over the mowing-machine and playing with the grass which
trickled through her fingers like sand.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He had silenced her, but her fears made him
uneasy.&#160; Not for the first time, he was threatened with
blackmail.&#160; He was rich and supposed to be moral; the Basts
knew that he was not, and might find it profitable to hint as
much.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"At all events, you mustn't worry," he
said.&#160; "This is a man's business." He thought intently.&#160;
"On no account mention it to anybody."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret flushed at advice so elementary,
but he was really paving the way for a lie.&#160; If necessary he
would deny that he had ever known Mrs. Bast, and prosecute her for
libel.&#160; Perhaps he never had known her.&#160; Here was
Margaret, who behaved as if he had not.&#160; There the
house.&#160; Round them were half a dozen gardeners, clearing up
after his daughter's wedding.&#160; All was so solid and spruce,
that the past flew up out of sight like a spring-blind, leaving
only the last five minutes unrolled.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Glancing at these, he saw that the car
would be round during the next five, and plunged into action.&#160;
Gongs were tapped, orders issued, Margaret was sent to dress, and
the housemaid to sweep up the long trickle of grass that she had
left across the hall.&#160; As is Man to the Universe, so was the
mind of Mr. Wilcox to the minds of some men--a concentrated light
upon a tiny spot, a little Ten Minutes moving self-contained
through its appointed years.&#160; No Pagan he, who lives for the
Now, and may be wiser than all philosophers.&#160; He lived for the
five minutes that have past, and the five to come; he had the
business mind.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How did he stand now, as his motor slipped
out of Oniton and breasted the great round hills?&#160; Margaret
had heard a certain rumour, but was all right.&#160; She had
forgiven him, God bless her, and he felt the manlier for it.&#160;
Charles and Evie had not heard it, and never must hear.&#160; No
more must Paul.&#160; Over his children he felt great tenderness,
which he did not try to track to a cause: Mrs. Wilcox was too far
back in his life.&#160; He did not connect her with the sudden
aching love that he felt for Evie.&#160; Poor little Evie!&#160; he
trusted that Cahill would make her a decent husband.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And Margaret?&#160; How did she
stand?&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She had several minor worries.&#160;
Clearly her sister had heard something.&#160; She dreaded meeting
her in town.&#160; And she was anxious about Leonard, for whom they
certainly were responsible.&#160; Nor ought Mrs. Bast to
starve.&#160; But the main situation had not altered.&#160; She
still loved Henry.&#160; His actions, not his disposition, had
disappointed her, and she could bear that.&#160; And she loved her
future home.&#160; Standing up in the car, just where she had leapt
from it two days before, she gazed back with deep emotion upon
Oniton.&#160; Besides the Grange and the Castle keep, she could now
pick out the church and the black-and-white gables of the
George.&#160; There was the bridge, and the river nibbling its
green peninsula.&#160; She could even see the bathing-shed, but
while she was looking for Charles's new springboard, the forehead
of the hill rose up and hid the whole scene.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She never saw it again.&#160; Day and night
the river flows down into England, day after day the sun retreats
into the Welsh mountains, and the tower chimes, "See the Conquering
Hero." But the Wilcoxes have no part in the place, nor in any
place.&#160; It is not their names that recur in the parish
register.&#160; It is not their ghosts that sigh among the alders
at evening.&#160; They have swept into the valley and swept out of
it, leaving a little dust and a little money behind.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 30</h3>
<p>Tibby was now approaching his last year at Oxford.&#160; He had
moved out of college, and was contemplating the Universe, or such
portions of it as concerned him, from his comfortable lodgings in
Long Wall.&#160; He was not concerned with much.&#160; When a young
man is untroubled by passions and sincerely indifferent to public
opinion, his outlook is necessarily limited.&#160; Tibby neither
wished to strengthen the position of the rich nor to improve that
of the poor, and so was well content to watch the elms nodding
behind the mildly embattled parapets of Magdalen.&#160; There are
worse lives.&#160; Though selfish, he was never cruel; though
affected in manner, he never posed.&#160; Like Margaret, he
disdained the heroic equipment, and it was only after many visits
that men discovered Schlegel to possess a character and a
brain.&#160; He had done well in Mods, much to the surprise of
those who attended lectures and took proper exercise, and was now
glancing disdainfully at Chinese in case he should some day consent
to qualify as a Student Interpreter.&#160; To him thus employed
Helen entered.&#160; A telegram had preceded her.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He noticed, in a distant way, that his
sister had altered.&#160; As a rule he found her too pronounced,
and had never come across this look of appeal, pathetic yet
dignified--the look of a sailor who has lost everything at
sea.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I have come from Oniton," she began.&#160;
"There has been a great deal of trouble there."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Who's for lunch?" said Tibby, picking up
the claret, which was warming in the hearth.&#160; Helen sat down
submissively at the table.&#160; "Why such an early start?" he
asked.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Sunrise or something--when I could get
away."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So I surmise.&#160; Why?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't know what's to be done,
Tibby.&#160; I am very much upset at a piece of news that concerns
Meg, and do not want to face her, and I am not going back to
Wickham Place.&#160; I stopped here to tell you this."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The landlady came in with the
cutlets.&#160; Tibby put a marker in the leaves of his Chinese
Grammar and helped them.&#160; Oxford--the Oxford of the
vacation--dreamed and rustled outside, and indoors the little fire
was coated with grey where the sunshine touched it.&#160; Helen
continued her odd story.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Give Meg my love and say that I want to be
alone.&#160; I mean to go to Munich or else Bonn."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Such a message is easily given," said her
brother.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"As regards Wickham Place and my share of
the furniture, you and she are to do exactly as you like.&#160; My
own feeling is that everything may just as well be sold.&#160; What
does one want with dusty economic, books, which have made the world
no better, or with mother's hideous chiffoniers?&#160; I have also
another commission for you.&#160; I want you to deliver a
letter."&#160; She got up.&#160; "I haven't written it yet.&#160;
Why shouldn't I post it, though?"&#160; She sat down again.&#160;
"My head is rather wretched.&#160; I hope that none of your friends
are likely to come in."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tibby locked the door.&#160; His friends
often found it in this condition.&#160; Then he asked whether
anything had gone wrong at Evie's wedding.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not there," said Helen, and burst into
tears.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He had known her hysterical--it was one of
her aspects with which he had no concern--and yet these tears
touched him as something unusual.&#160; They were nearer the things
that did concern him, such as music.&#160; He laid down his knife
and looked at her curiously.&#160; Then, as she continued to sob,
he went on with his lunch.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The time came for the second course, and
she was still crying.&#160; Apple Charlotte was to follow, which
spoils by waiting.&#160; "Do you mind Mrs. Martlett coming in?" he
asked, "or shall I take it from her at the door?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Could I bathe my eyes, Tibby?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He took her to his bedroom, and introduced
the pudding in her absence.&#160; Having helped himself, he put it
down to warm in the hearth.&#160; His hand stretched towards the
Grammar, and soon he was turning over the pages, raising his
eyebrows scornfully, perhaps at human nature, perhaps at
Chinese.&#160; To him thus employed Helen returned.&#160; She had
pulled herself together, but the grave appeal had not vanished from
her eyes.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Now for the explanation," she said.&#160;
"Why didn't I begin with it?&#160; I have found out something about
Mr. Wilcox.&#160; He has behaved very wrongly indeed, and ruined
two people's lives.&#160; It all came on me very suddenly last
night; I am very much upset, and I do not know what to do.&#160;
Mrs. Bast--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, those people!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen seemed silenced.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Shall I lock the door again?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, thanks, Tibbikins.&#160; You're being
very good to me.&#160; I want to tell you the story before I go
abroad.&#160; You must do exactly what you like--treat it as part
of the furniture.&#160; Meg cannot have heard it yet, I
think.&#160; But I cannot face her and tell her that the man she is
going to marry has misconducted himself.&#160; I don't even know
whether she ought to be told.&#160; Knowing as she does that I
dislike him, she will suspect me, and think that I want to ruin her
match.&#160; I simply don't know what to make of such a
thing.&#160; I trust your judgment.&#160; What would you do?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I gather he has had a mistress," said
Tibby.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen flushed with shame and anger.&#160;
"And ruined two people's lives.&#160; And goes about saying that
personal actions count for nothing, and there always will be rich
and poor.&#160; He met her when he was trying to get rich out in
Cyprus--I don't wish to make him worse than he is, and no doubt she
was ready enough to meet him.&#160; But there it is.&#160; They
met.&#160; He goes his way and she goes hers.&#160; What do you
suppose is the end of such women?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He conceded that it was a bad
business.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"They end in two ways: Either they sink
till the lunatic asylums and the workhouses are full of them, and
cause Mr. Wilcox to write letters to the papers complaining of our
national degeneracy, or else they entrap a boy into marriage before
it is too late.&#160; She--I can't blame her.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But this isn't all," she continued after a
long pause, during which the landlady served them with
coffee.&#160; "I come now to the business that took us to
Oniton.&#160; We went all three.&#160; Acting on Mr. Wilcox's
advice, the man throws up a secure situation and takes an insecure
one, from which he is dismissed.&#160; There are certain excuses,
but in the main Mr. Wilcox is to blame, as Meg herself
admitted.&#160; It is only common justice that he should employ the
man himself.&#160; But he meets the woman, and, like the cur that
he is, he refuses, and tries to get rid of them.&#160; He makes Meg
write.&#160; Two notes came from her late that evening--one for me,
one for Leonard, dismissing him with barely a reason.&#160; I
couldn't understand.&#160; Then it comes out that Mrs. Bast had
spoken to Mr. Wilcox on the lawn while we left her to get rooms,
and was still speaking about him when Leonard came back to
her.&#160; This Leonard knew all along.&#160; He thought it natural
he should be ruined twice.&#160; Natural!&#160; Could you have
contained yourself?.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It is certainly a very bad business," said
Tibby.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His reply seemed to calm his sister.&#160;
"I was afraid that I saw it out of proportion.&#160; But you are
right outside it, and you must know.&#160; In a day or two--or
perhaps a week--take whatever steps you think fit.&#160; I leave it
in your hands."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She concluded her charge.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The facts as they touch Meg are all before
you," she added; and Tibby sighed and felt it rather hard that,
because of his open mind, he should be empanelled to serve as a
juror.&#160; He had never been interested in human beings, for
which one must blame him, but he had had rather too much of them at
Wickham Place.&#160; Just as some people cease to attend when books
are mentioned, so Tibby's attention wandered when "personal
relations" came under discussion.&#160; Ought Margaret to know what
Helen knew the Basts to know?&#160; Similar questions had vexed him
from infancy, and at Oxford he had learned to say that the
importance of human beings has been vastly overrated by
specialists.&#160; The epigram, with its faint whiff of the
eighties, meant nothing.&#160; But he might have let it off now if
his sister had not been ceaselessly beautiful.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You see, Helen--have a cigarette--I don't
see what I'm to do."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then there's nothing to be done.&#160; I
dare say you are right.&#160; Let them marry.&#160; There remains
the question of compensation.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do you want me to adjudicate that
too?&#160; Had you not better consult an expert?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"This part is in confidence," said
Helen.&#160; "It has nothing to do with Meg, and do not mention it
to her.&#160; The compensation--I do not see who is to pay it if I
don't, and I have already decided on the minimum sum.&#160; As soon
as possible I am placing it to your account, and when I am in
Germany you will pay it over for me.&#160; I shall never forget
your kindness, Tibbikins, if you do this."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What is the sum?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Five thousand."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Good God alive!" said Tibby, and went
crimson.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Now, what is the good of driblets?&#160;
To go through life having done one thing--to have raised one person
from the abyss: not these puny gifts of shillings and
blankets--making the grey more grey.&#160; No doubt people will
think me extraordinary."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't care a damn what people think!"
cried he, heated to unusual manliness of diction.&#160; "But it's
half what you have."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not nearly half." She spread out her hands
over her soiled skirt.&#160; "I have far too much, and we settled
at Chelsea last spring that three hundred a year is necessary to
set a man on his feet.&#160; What I give will bring in a hundred
and fifty between two.&#160; It isn't enough."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He could not recover.&#160; He was not
angry or even shocked, and he saw that Helen would still have
plenty to live on.&#160; But it amazed him to think what haycocks
people can make of their lives.&#160; His delicate intonations
would not work, and he could only blurt out that the five thousand
pounds would mean a great deal of bother for him personally.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I didn't expect you to understand
me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I?&#160; I understand nobody."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But you'll do it?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Apparently."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I leave you two commissions, then.&#160;
The first concerns Mr. Wilcox, and you are to use your
discretion.&#160; The second concerns the money, and is to be
mentioned to no one, and carried out literally.&#160; You will send
a hundred pounds on account tomorrow."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He walked with her to the station, passing
through those streets whose serried beauty never bewildered him and
never fatigued.&#160; The lovely creature raised domes and spires
into the cloudless blue, and only the ganglion of vulgarity round
Carfax showed how evanescent was the phantom, how faint its claim
to represent England.&#160; Helen, rehearsing her commission,
noticed nothing: the Basts were in her brain, and she retold the
crisis in a meditative way, which might have made other men
curious.&#160; She was seeing whether it would hold.&#160; He asked
her once why she had taken the Basts right into the heart of Evie's
wedding.&#160; She stopped like a frightened animal and said, "Does
that seem to you so odd?"&#160; Her eyes, the hand laid on the
mouth, quite haunted him, until they were absorbed into the figure
of St. Mary the Virgin, before whom he paused for a moment on the
walk home.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is convenient to follow him in the
discharge of his duties.&#160; Margaret summoned him the next
day.&#160; She was terrified at Helen's flight, and he had to say
that she had called in at Oxford.&#160; Then she said: "Did she
seem worried at any rumour about Henry?"&#160; He answered, "Yes."
"I knew it was that!" she exclaimed.&#160; "I'll write to
her."&#160; Tibby was relieved.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He then sent the cheque to the address that
Helen gave him, and stated that later on he was instructed to
forward five thousand pounds.&#160; An answer came back, very civil
and quiet in tone--such an answer as Tibby himself would have
given.&#160; The cheque was returned, the legacy refused, the
writer being in no need of money.&#160; Tibby forwarded this to
Helen, adding in the fulness of his heart that Leonard Bast seemed
somewhat a monumental person after all.&#160; Helen's reply was
frantic.&#160; He was to take no notice.&#160; He was to go down at
once and say that she commanded acceptance.&#160; He went.&#160; A
scurf of books and china ornaments awaited them.&#160; The Basts
had just been evicted for not paying their rent, and had wandered
no one knew whither.&#160; Helen had begun bungling with her money
by this time, and had even sold out her shares in the Nottingham
and Derby Railway.&#160; For some weeks she did nothing.&#160; Then
she reinvested, and, owing to the good advice of her stockbrokers,
became rather richer than she had been before.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 31</h3>
<p>Houses have their own ways of dying, falling as variously as the
generations of men, some with a tragic roar, some quietly, but to
an after-life in the city of ghosts, while from others--and thus
was the death of Wickham Place--the spirit slips before the body
perishes.&#160; It had decayed in the spring, disintegrating the
girls more than they knew, and causing either to accost unfamiliar
regions.&#160; By September it was a corpse, void of emotion, and
scarcely hallowed by the memories of thirty years of
happiness.&#160; Through its round-topped doorway passed furniture,
and pictures, and books, until the last room was gutted and the
last van had rumbled away.&#160; It stood for a week or two longer,
open-eyed, as if astonished at its own emptiness.&#160; Then it
fell.&#160; Navvies came, and spilt it back into the grey.&#160;
With their muscles and their beery good temper, they were not the
worst of undertakers for a house which had always been human, and
had not mistaken culture for an end.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The furniture, with a few exceptions, went
down into Hertfordshire, Mr. Wilcox having most kindly offered
Howards End as a warehouse.&#160; Mr. Bryce had died abroad--an
unsatisfactory affair--and as there seemed little guarantee that
the rent would be paid regularly, he cancelled the agreement, and
resumed possession himself.&#160; Until he relet the house, the
Schlegels were welcome to stack their furniture in the garage and
lower rooms.&#160; Margaret demurred, but Tibby accepted the offer
gladly; it saved him from coming to any decision about the
future.&#160; The plate and the more valuable pictures found a
safer home in London, but the bulk of the things went country-ways,
and were entrusted to the guardianship of Miss Avery.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Shortly before the move, our hero and
heroine were married.&#160; They have weathered the storm, and may
reasonably expect peace.&#160; To have no illusions and yet to
love--what stronger surety can a woman find?&#160; She had seen her
husband's past as well as his heart.&#160; She knew her own heart
with a thoroughness that commonplace people believe
impossible.&#160; The heart of Mrs. Wilcox was alone hidden, and
perhaps it is superstitious to speculate on the feelings of the
dead.&#160; They were married quietly--really quietly, for as the
day approached she refused to go through another Oniton.&#160; Her
brother gave her away, her aunt, who was out of health, presided
over a few colourless refreshments.&#160; The Wilcoxes were
represented by Charles, who witnessed the marriage settlement, and
by Mr. Cahill.&#160; Paul did send a cablegram.&#160; In a few
minutes, and without the aid of music, the clergyman made them man
and wife, and soon the glass shade had fallen that cuts off married
couples from the world.&#160; She, a monogamist, regretted the
cessation of some of life's innocent odours; he, whose instincts
were polygamous, felt morally braced by the change, and less liable
to the temptations that had assailed him in the past.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They spent their honeymoon near
Innsbruck.&#160; Henry knew of a reliable hotel there, and Margaret
hoped for a meeting with her sister.&#160; In this she was
disappointed.&#160; As they came south, Helen retreated over the
Brenner, and wrote an unsatisfactory postcard from the shores of
the Lake of Garda, saying that her plans were uncertain and had
better be ignored.&#160; Evidently she disliked meeting
Henry.&#160; Two months are surely enough to accustom an outsider
to a situation which a wife has accepted in two days, and Margaret
had again to regret her sister's lack of self-control.&#160; In a
long letter she pointed out the need of charity in sexual matters:
so little is known about them; it is hard enough for those who are
personally touched to judge; then how futile must be the verdict of
Society.&#160; "I don't say there is no standard, for that would
destroy morality; only that there can be no standard until our
impulses are classified and better understood." Helen thanked her
for her kind letter--rather a curious reply.&#160; She moved south
again, and spoke of wintering in Naples.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Wilcox was not sorry that the meeting
failed.&#160; Helen left him time to grow skin over his
wound.&#160; There were still moments when it pained him.&#160; Had
he only known that Margaret was awaiting him--Margaret, so lively
and intelligent, and yet so submissive--he would have kept himself
worthier of her.&#160; Incapable of grouping the past, he confused
the episode of Jacky with another episode that had taken place in
the days of his bachelorhood.&#160; The two made one crop of wild
oats, for which he was heartily sorry, and he could not see that
those oats are of a darker stock which are rooted in another's
dishonour.&#160; Unchastity and infidelity were as confused to him
as to the Middle Ages, his only moral teacher.&#160; Ruth (poor old
Ruth!) did not enter into his calculations at all, for poor old
Ruth had never found him out.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His affection for his present wife grew
steadily.&#160; Her cleverness gave him no trouble, and, indeed, he
liked to see her reading poetry or something about social
questions; it distinguished her from the wives of other men.&#160;
He had only to call, and she clapped the book up and was ready to
do what he wished.&#160; Then they would argue so jollily, and once
or twice she had him in quite a tight corner, but as soon as he
grew really serious, she gave in.&#160; Man is for war, woman for
the recreation of the warrior, but he does not dislike it if she
makes a show of fight.&#160; She cannot win in a real battle,
having no muscles, only nerves.&#160; Nerves make her jump out of a
moving motor-car, or refuse to be married fashionably.&#160; The
warrior may well allow her to triumph on such occasions; they move
not the imperishable plinth of things that touch his peace.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret had a bad attack of these nerves
during the honeymoon.&#160; He told her--casually, as was his
habit--that Oniton Grange was let.&#160; She showed her annoyance,
and asked rather crossly why she had not been consulted.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I didn't want to bother you," he
replied.&#160; "Besides, I have only heard for certain this
morning."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Where are we to live?" said Margaret,
trying to laugh.&#160; "I loved the place extraordinarily.&#160;
Don't you believe in having a permanent home, Henry?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He assured her that she misunderstood
him.&#160; It is home life that distinguishes us from the
foreigner.&#160; But he did not believe in a damp home.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"This is news.&#160; I never heard till
this minute that Oniton was damp."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"My dear girl!"--he flung out his
hand--"have you eyes?&#160; have you a skin?&#160; How could it be
anything but damp in such a situation?&#160; In the first place,
the Grange is on clay, and built where the castle moat must have
been; then there's that destestable little river, steaming all
night like a kettle.&#160; Feel the cellar walls; look up under the
eaves.&#160; Ask Sir James or anyone.&#160; Those Shropshire
valleys are notorious.&#160; The only possible place for a house in
Shropshire is on a hill; but, for my part, I think the country is
too far from London, and the scenery nothing special.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret could not resist saying, "Why did
you go there, then?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I--because--" He drew his head back and
grew rather angry.&#160; "Why have we come to the Tyrol, if it
comes to that?&#160; One might go on asking such questions
indefinitely."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One might; but he was only gaining time for
a plausible answer.&#160; Out it came, and he believed it as soon
as it was spoken.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The truth is, I took Oniton on account of
Evie.&#160; Don't let this go any further."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Certainly not."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I shouldn't like her to know that she
nearly let me in for a very bad bargain.&#160; No sooner did I sign
the agreement than she got engaged.&#160; Poor little girl!&#160;
She was so keen on it all, and wouldn't even wait to make proper
inquiries about the shooting.&#160; Afraid it would get snapped
up--just like all of your sex.&#160; Well, no harm's done.&#160;
She has had her country wedding, and I've got rid of my house to
some fellows who are starting a preparatory school."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Where shall we live, then, Henry?&#160; I
should enjoy living somewhere."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I have not yet decided.&#160; What about
Norfolk?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret was silent.&#160; Marriage had not
saved her from the sense of flux.&#160; London was but a foretaste
of this nomadic civilization which is altering human nature so
profoundly, and throws upon personal relations a stress greater
than they have ever borne before.&#160; Under cosmopolitanism, if
it comes, we shall receive no help from the earth.&#160; Trees and
meadows and mountains will only be a spectacle, and the binding
force that they once exercised on character must be entrusted to
Love alone.&#160; May Love be equal to the task!&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It is now what?" continued Henry.&#160;
"Nearly October.&#160; Let us camp for the winter at Ducie Street,
and look out for something in the spring.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If possible, something permanent.&#160; I
can't be as young as I was, for these alterations don't suit
me.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But, my dear, which would you rather
have--alterations or rheumatism?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I see your point," said Margaret, getting
up.&#160; "If Oniton is really damp, it is impossible, and must be
inhabited by little boys.&#160; Only, in the spring, let us look
before we leap.&#160; I will take warning by Evie, and not hurry
you.&#160; Remember that you have a free hand this time.&#160;
These endless moves must be bad for the furniture, and are
certainly expensive."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What a practical little woman it is!&#160;
What's it been reading?&#160; Theo--theo--how much?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Theosophy."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So Ducie Street was her first fate--a
pleasant enough fate.&#160; The house, being only a little larger
than Wickham Place, trained her for the immense establishment that
was promised in the spring.&#160; They were frequently away, but at
home life ran fairly regularly.&#160; In the morning Henry went to
the business, and his sandwich--a relic this of some prehistoric
craving--was always cut by her own hand.&#160; He did not rely upon
the sandwich for lunch, but liked to have it by him in case he grew
hungry at eleven.&#160; When he had gone, there was the house to
look after, and the servants to humanize, and several kettles of
Helen's to keep on the boil.&#160; Her conscience pricked her a
little about the Basts; she was not sorry to have lost sight of
them.&#160; No doubt Leonard was worth helping, but being Henry's
wife, she preferred to help someone else.&#160; As for theatres and
discussion societies, they attracted her less and less.&#160; She
began to "miss" new movements, and to spend her spare time
re-reading or thinking, rather to the concern of her Chelsea
friends.&#160; They attributed the change to her marriage, and
perhaps some deep instinct did warn her not to travel further from
her husband than was inevitable.&#160; Yet the main cause lay
deeper still; she had outgrown stimulants, and was passing from
words to things.&#160; It was doubtless a pity not to keep up with
Wedekind or John, but some closing of the gates is inevitable after
thirty, if the mind itself is to become a creative power.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 32</h3>
<p>She was looking at plans one day in the following spring--they
had finally decided to go down into Sussex and build--when Mrs.
Charles Wilcox was announced.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Have you heard the news?" Dolly cried, as
soon as she entered the room.&#160; "Charles is so ang--I mean he
is sure you know about it, or rather, that you don't know."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why, Dolly!" said Margaret, placidly
kissing her.&#160; "Here's a surprise!&#160; How are the boys and
the baby?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Boys and the baby were well, and in
describing a great row that there had been at Hilton Tennis Club,
Dolly forgot her news.&#160; The wrong people had tried to get
in.&#160; The rector, as representing the older inhabitants, had
said--Charles had said--the tax-collector had said--Charles had
regretted not saying--and she closed the description with, "But
lucky you, with four courts of your own at Midhurst."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It will be very jolly," replied
Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Are those the plans?&#160; Does it matter
me seeing them?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Of course not."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Charles has never seen the plans."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"They have only just arrived.&#160; Here is
the ground floor--no, that's rather difficult.&#160; Try the
elevation.&#160; We are to have a good many gables and a
picturesque sky-line."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What makes it smell so funny?" said Dolly,
after a moment's inspection.&#160; She was incapable of
understanding plans or maps.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I suppose the paper."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And <em>which</em> way up is it?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Just the ordinary way up.&#160; That's the
sky-line, and the part that smells strongest is the sky."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, ask me another.&#160;
Margaret--oh--what was I going to say?&#160; How's Helen?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Quite well."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Is she never coming back to England?&#160;
Every one thinks it's awfully odd she doesn't."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So it is," said Margaret, trying to
conceal her vexation.&#160; She was getting rather sore on this
point.&#160; "Helen is odd, awfully.&#160; She has now been away
eight months.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But hasn't she any address?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"A poste restante somewhere in Bavaria is
her address.&#160; Do write her a line.&#160; I will look it up for
you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, don't bother.&#160; That's eight
months she has been away, surely?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Exactly.&#160; She left just after Evie's
wedding.&#160; It would be eight months."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Just when baby was born, then?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Just so."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dolly sighed, and stared enviously round
the drawing-room.&#160; She was beginning to lose her brightness
and good looks.&#160; The Charles' were not well off, for Mr.
Wilcox, having brought up his children with expensive tastes,
believed in letting them shift for themselves.&#160; After all, he
had not treated them generously.&#160; Yet another baby was
expected, she told Margaret, and they would have to give up the
motor.&#160; Margaret sympathized, but in a formal fashion, and
Dolly little imagined that the step-mother was urging Mr. Wilcox to
make them a more liberal allowance.&#160; She sighed again, and at
last the particular grievance was remembered.&#160; "Oh yes," she
cried, "that is it: Miss Avery has been unpacking your
packing-cases."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why has she done that?&#160; How
unnecessary!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ask another.&#160; I suppose you ordered
her to."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I gave no such orders.&#160; Perhaps she
was airing the things.&#160; She did undertake to light an
occasional fire."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It was far more than an air," said Dolly
solemnly.&#160; "The floor sounds covered with books.&#160; Charles
sent me to know what is to be done, for he feels certain you don't
know."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Books!" cried Margaret, moved by the holy
word.&#160; "Dolly, are you serious?&#160; Has she been touching
our books?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Hasn't she, though!&#160; What used to be
the hall's full of them.&#160; Charles thought for certain you knew
of it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I am very much obliged to you,
Dolly.&#160; What can have come over Miss Avery?&#160; I must go
down about it at once.&#160; Some of the books are my brother's,
and are quite valuable.&#160; She had no right to open any of the
cases."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I say she's dotty.&#160; She was the one
that never got married, you know.&#160; Oh, I say, perhaps she
thinks your books are wedding-presents to herself.&#160; Old maids
are taken that way sometimes.&#160; Miss Avery hates us all like
poison ever since her frightful dust-up with Evie."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I hadn't heard of that," said
Margaret.&#160; A visit from Dolly had its compensations.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Didn't you know she gave Evie a present
last August, and Evie returned it, and then--oh, goloshes!&#160;
You never read such a letter as Miss Avery wrote."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But it was wrong of Evie to return
it.&#160; It wasn't like her to do such a heartless thing."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But the present was so expensive."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why does that make any difference,
Dolly?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Still, when it costs over five pounds--I
didn't see it, but it was a lovely enamel pendant from a Bond
Street shop.&#160; You can't very well accept that kind of thing
from a farm woman.&#160; Now, can you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You accepted a present from Miss Avery
when you were married.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, mine was old earthenware stuff--not
worth a halfpenny.&#160; Evie's was quite different.&#160; You'd
have to ask anyone to the wedding who gave you a pendant like
that.&#160; Uncle Percy and Albert and father and Charles all said
it was quite impossible, and when four men agree, what is a girl to
do?&#160; Evie didn't want to upset the old thing, so thought a
sort of joking letter best, and returned the pendant straight to
the shop to save Miss Avery trouble."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But Miss Avery said--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dolly's eyes grew round.&#160; "It was a
perfectly awful letter.&#160; Charles said it was the letter of a
madman.&#160; In the end she had the pendant back again from the
shop and threw it into the duckpond.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Did she give any reasons?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We think she meant to be invited to
Oniton, and so climb into society."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She's rather old for that," said Margaret
pensively.&#160; "May not she have given the present to Evie in
remembrance of her mother?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's a notion.&#160; Give every one
their due, eh?&#160; Well, I suppose I ought to be toddling.&#160;
Come along, Mr. Muff--you want a new coat, but I don't know who'll
give it you, I'm sure;" and addressing her apparel with mournful
humour, Dolly moved from the room.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret followed her to ask whether Henry
knew about Miss Avery's rudeness.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh yes."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I wonder, then, why he let me ask her to
look after the house."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But she's only a farm woman," said Dolly,
and her explanation proved correct.&#160; Henry only censured the
lower classes when it suited him.&#160; He bore with Miss Avery as
with Crane--because he could get good value out of them.&#160; "I
have patience with a man who knows his job," he would say, really
having patience with the job, and not the man.&#160; Paradoxical as
it may sound, he had something of the artist about him; he would
pass over an insult to his daughter sooner than lose a good
charwoman for his wife.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret judged it better to settle the
little trouble herself.&#160; Parties were evidently ruffled.&#160;
With Henry's permission, she wrote a pleasant note to Miss Avery,
asking her to leave the cases untouched.&#160; Then, at the first
convenient opportunity, she went down herself, intending to repack
her belongings and store them properly in the local warehouse: the
plan had been amateurish and a failure.&#160; Tibby promised to
accompany her, but at the last moment begged to be excused.&#160;
So, for the second time in her life, she entered the house
alone.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 33</h3>
<p>The day of her visit was exquisite, and the last of unclouded
happiness that she was to have for many months.&#160; Her anxiety
about Helen's extraordinary absence was still dormant, and as for a
possible brush with Miss Avery--that only gave zest to the
expedition.&#160; She had also eluded Dolly's invitation to
luncheon.&#160; Walking straight up from the station, she crossed
the village green and entered the long chestnut avenue that
connects it with the church.&#160; The church itself stood in the
village once.&#160; But it there attracted so many worshippers that
the devil, in a pet, snatched it from its foundations, and poised
it on an inconvenient knoll, three-quarters of a mile away.&#160;
If this story is true, the chestnut avenue must have been planted
by the angels.&#160; No more tempting approach could be imagined
for the luke-warm Christian, and if he still finds the walk too
long, the devil is defeated all the same, Science having built Holy
Trinity, a Chapel of Ease, near the Charles', and roofed it with
tin.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Up the avenue Margaret strolled slowly,
stopping to watch the sky that gleamed through the upper branches
of the chestnuts, or to finger the little horseshoes on the lower
branches.&#160; Why has not England a great mythology?&#160; Our
folklore has never advanced beyond daintiness, and the greater
melodies about our country-side have all issued through the pipes
of Greece.&#160; Deep and true as the native imagination can be, it
seems to have failed here.&#160; It has stopped with the witches
and the fairies.&#160; It cannot vivify one fraction of a summer
field, or give names to half a dozen stars.&#160; England still
waits for the supreme moment of her literature--for the great poet
who shall voice her, or, better still, for the thousand little
poets whose voices shall pass into our common talk.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the church the scenery changed.&#160;
The chestnut avenue opened into a road, smooth but narrow, which
led into the untouched country.&#160; She followed it for over a
mile.&#160; Its little hesitations pleased her.&#160; Having no
urgent destiny, it strolled downhill or up as it wished, taking no
trouble about the gradients, nor about the view, which nevertheless
expanded.&#160; The great estates that throttle the south of
Hertfordshire were less obtrusive here, and the appearance of the
land was neither aristocratic nor suburban.&#160; To define it was
difficult, but Margaret knew what it was not: it was not
snobbish.&#160; Though its contours were slight, there was a touch
of freedom in their sweep to which Surrey will never attain, and
the distant brow of the Chilterns towered like a mountain.&#160;
"Left to itself," was Margaret's opinion, "this county would vote
Liberal."&#160; The comradeship, not passionate, that is our
highest gift as a nation, was promised by it, as by the low brick
farm where she called for the key.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the inside of the farm was
disappointing.&#160; A most finished young person received
her.&#160; "Yes, Mrs. Wilcox; no, Mrs. Wilcox; oh yes, Mrs. Wilcox,
auntie received your letter quite duly.&#160; Auntie has gone up to
your little place at the present moment.&#160; Shall I send the
servant to direct you?"&#160; Followed by: "Of course, auntie does
not generally look after your place; she only does it to oblige a
neighbour as something exceptional.&#160; It gives her something to
do.&#160; She spends quite a lot of her time there.&#160; My
husband says to me sometimes, 'Where's auntie?' I say, 'Need you
ask?&#160; She's at Howards End.' Yes, Mrs. Wilcox.&#160; Mrs.
Wilcox, could I prevail upon you to accept a piece of cake?&#160;
Not if I cut it for you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret refused the cake, but
unfortunately this acquired her gentility in the eyes of Miss
Avery's niece.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I cannot let you go on alone.&#160; Now
don't.&#160; You really mustn't.&#160; I will direct you myself if
it comes to that.&#160; I must get my hat.&#160;
Now"--roguishly--"Mrs. Wilcox, don't you move while I'm
gone."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Stunned, Margaret did not move from the
best parlour, over which the touch of art nouveau had fallen.&#160;
But the other rooms looked in keeping, though they conveyed the
peculiar sadness of a rural interior.&#160; Here had lived an elder
race, to which we look back with disquietude.&#160; The country
which we visit at week-ends was really a home to it, and the graver
sides of life, the deaths, the partings, the yearnings for love,
have their deepest expression in the heart of the fields.&#160; All
was not sadness.&#160; The sun was shining without.&#160; The
thrush sang his two syllables on the budding guelder-rose.&#160;
Some children were playing uproariously in heaps of golden
straw.&#160; It was the presence of sadness at all that surprised
Margaret, and ended by giving her a feeling of completeness.&#160;
In these English farms, if anywhere, one might see life steadily
and see it whole, group in one vision its transitoriness and its
eternal youth, connect--connect without bitterness until all men
are brothers.&#160; But her thoughts were interrupted by the return
of Miss Avery's niece, and were so tranquillizing that she suffered
the interruption gladly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was quicker to go out by the back door,
and, after due explanations, they went out by it.&#160; The niece
was now mortified by unnumerable chickens, who rushed up to her
feet for food, and by a shameless and maternal sow.&#160; She did
not know what animals were coming to.&#160; But her gentility
withered at the touch of the sweet air.&#160; The wind was rising,
scattering the straw and ruffling the tails of the ducks as they
floated in families over Evie's pendant.&#160; One of those
delicious gales of spring, in which leaves stiff in bud seem to
rustle, swept over the land and then fell silent.&#160; "Georgia,"
sang the thrush.&#160; "Cuckoo," came furtively from the cliff of
pine-trees.&#160; "Georgia, pretty Georgia," and the other birds
joined in with nonsense.&#160; The hedge was a half-painted picture
which would be finished in a few days.&#160; Celandines grew on its
banks, lords and ladies and primroses in the defended hollows; the
wild rose-bushes, still bearing their withered hips, showed also
the promise of blossom.&#160; Spring had come, clad in no classical
garb, yet fairer than all springs; fairer even than she who walks
through the myrtles of Tuscany with the graces before her and the
zephyr behind.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two women walked up the lane full of
outward civility.&#160; But Margaret was thinking how difficult it
was to be earnest about furniture on such a day, and the niece was
thinking about hats.&#160; Thus engaged, they reached Howards
End.&#160; Petulant cries of "Auntie!" severed the air.&#160; There
was no reply, and the front door was locked.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Are you sure that Miss Avery is up here?"
asked Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh yes, Mrs. Wilcox, quite sure.&#160; She
is here daily."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret tried to look in through the
dining-room window, but the curtain inside was drawn tightly.&#160;
So with the drawing-room and the hall.&#160; The appearance of
these curtains was familiar, yet she did not remember them being
there on her other visit: her impression was that Mr. Bryce had
taken everything away.&#160; They tried the back.&#160; Here again
they received no answer, and could see nothing; the kitchen-window
was fitted with a blind, while the pantry and scullery had pieces
of wood propped up against them, which looked ominously like the
lids of packing-cases.&#160; Margaret thought of her books, and she
lifted up her voice also.&#160; At the first cry she
succeeded.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, well!" replied someone inside the
house.&#160; "If it isn't Mrs. Wilcox come at last!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Have you got the key, auntie?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Madge, go away," said Miss Avery, still
invisible.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Auntie, it's Mrs. Wilcox--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret supported her.&#160; "Your niece
and I have come together--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Madge, go away.&#160; This is no moment
for your hat."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The poor woman went red.&#160; "Auntie gets
more eccentric lately," she said nervously.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Miss Avery!" called Margaret.&#160; "I
have come about the furniture.&#160; Could you kindly let me
in?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, Mrs. Wilcox," said the voice, "of
course." But after that came silence.&#160; They called again
without response.&#160; They walked round the house
disconsolately.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I hope Miss Avery is not ill," hazarded
Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, if you'll excuse me," said Madge,
"perhaps I ought to be leaving you now.&#160; The servants need
seeing to at the farm.&#160; Auntie is so odd at times." Gathering
up her elegancies, she retired defeated, and, as if her departure
had loosed a spring, the front door opened at once.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Miss Avery said, "Well, come right in, Mrs.
Wilcox!" quite pleasantly and calmly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Thank you so much," began Margaret, but
broke off at the sight of an umbrella-stand.&#160; It was her
own.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Come right into the hall first," said Miss
Avery.&#160; She drew the curtain, and Margaret uttered a cry of
despair.&#160; For an appalling thing had happened.&#160; The hall
was fitted up with the contents of the library from Wickham
Place.&#160; The carpet had been laid, the big work-table drawn up
near the window; the bookcases filled the wall opposite the
fireplace, and her father's sword--this is what bewildered her
particularly--had been drawn from its scabbard and hung naked
amongst the sober volumes.&#160; Miss Avery must have worked for
days.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'm afraid this isn't what we meant," she
began.&#160; "Mr. Wilcox and I never intended the cases to be
touched.&#160; For instance, these books are my brother's.&#160; We
are storing them for him and for my sister, who is abroad.&#160;
When you kindly undertook to look after things, we never expected
you to do so much."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The house has been empty long enough,"
said the old woman.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret refused to argue.&#160; "I dare
say we didn't explain," she said civilly.&#160; "It has been a
mistake, and very likely our mistake."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Mrs. Wilcox, it has been mistake upon
mistake for fifty years.&#160; The house is Mrs. Wilcox's, and she
would not desire it to stand empty any longer."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To help the poor decaying brain, Margaret
said:<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, Mrs. Wilcox's house, the mother of
Mr. Charles."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Mistake upon mistake," said Miss
Avery.&#160; "Mistake upon mistake."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, I don't know," said Margaret,
sitting down in one of her own chairs.&#160; "I really don't know
what's to be done."&#160; She could not help laughing.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The other said: "Yes, it should be a merry
house enough."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't know--I dare say.&#160; Well,
thank you very much, Miss Avery.&#160; Yes, that's all right.&#160;
Delightful."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There is still the parlour." She went
through the door opposite and drew a curtain.&#160; Light flooded
the drawing-room and the drawing-room furniture from Wickham
Place.&#160; "And the dining-room."&#160; More curtains were drawn,
more windows were flung open to the spring.&#160; "Then through
here--" Miss Avery continued passing and repassing through the
hall.&#160; Her voice was lost, but Margaret heard her pulling up
the kitchen blind.&#160; "I've not finished here yet," she
announced, returning.&#160; "There's still a deal to do.&#160; The
farm lads will carry your great wardrobes upstairs, for there is no
need to go into expense at Hilton."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It is all a mistake," repeated Margaret,
feeling that she must put her foot down.&#160; "A
misunderstanding.&#160; Mr. Wilcox and I are not going to live at
Howards End."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, indeed.&#160; On account of his hay
fever?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We have settled to build a new home for
ourselves in Sussex, and part of this furniture--my part--will go
down there presently." She looked at Miss Avery intently, trying to
understand the kink in her brain.&#160; Here was no maundering old
woman.&#160; Her wrinkles were shrewd and humorous.&#160; She
looked capable of scathing wit and also of high but unostentatious
nobility.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You think that you won't come back to live
here, Mrs. Wilcox, but you will."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That remains to be seen," said Margaret,
smiling.&#160; "We have no intention of doing so for the
present.&#160; We happen to need a much larger house.&#160;
Circumstances oblige us to give big parties.&#160; Of course, some
day--one never knows, does one?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Miss Avery retorted: "Some day!&#160;
Tcha!&#160; tcha!&#160; Don't talk about some day.&#160; You are
living here now."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Am I?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You are living here, and have been for the
last ten minutes, if you ask me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was a senseless remark, but with a queer
feeling of disloyalty Margaret rose from her chair.&#160; She felt
that Henry had been obscurely censured.&#160; They went into the
dining-room, where the sunlight poured in upon her mother's
chiffonier, and upstairs, where many an old god peeped from a new
niche.&#160; The furniture fitted extraordinarily well.&#160; In
the central room--over the hall, the room that Helen had slept in
four years ago--Miss Avery had placed Tibby's old bassinette.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The nursery," she said.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret turned away without
speaking.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At last everything was seen.&#160; The
kitchen and lobby were still stacked with furniture and straw, but,
as far as she could make out, nothing had been broken or
scratched.&#160; A pathetic display of ingenuity!&#160; Then they
took a friendly stroll in the garden.&#160; It had gone wild since
her last visit.&#160; The gravel sweep was weedy, and grass had
sprung up at the very jaws of the garage.&#160; And Evie's rockery
was only bumps.&#160; Perhaps Evie was responsible for Miss Avery's
oddness.&#160; But Margaret suspected that the cause lay deeper,
and that the girl's silly letter had but loosed the irritation of
years.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's a beautiful meadow," she
remarked.&#160; It was one of those open-air drawing-rooms that
have been formed, hundreds of years ago, out of the smaller
fields.&#160; So the boundary hedge zigzagged down the hill at
right angles, and at the bottom there was a little green annex--a
sort of powder-closet for the cows.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, the maidy's well enough," said Miss
Avery, "for those that is, who don't suffer from sneezing." And she
cackled maliciously.&#160; "I've seen Charlie Wilcox go out to my
lads in hay time--oh, they ought to do this--they mustn't do
that--he'd learn them to be lads.&#160; And just then the tickling
took him.&#160; He has it from his father, with other things.&#160;
There's not one Wilcox that can stand up against a field in June--I
laughed fit to burst while he was courting Ruth."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"My brother gets hay fever too," said
Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"This house lies too much on the land for
them.&#160; Naturally, they were glad enough to slip in at
first.&#160; But Wilcoxes are better than nothing, as I see you've
found."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret laughed.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"They keep a place going, don't they?&#160;
Yes, it is just that."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"They keep England going, it is my
opinion."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Miss Avery upset her by replying: "Ay,
they breed like rabbits.&#160; Well, well, it's a funny
world.&#160; But He who made it knows what He wants in it, I
suppose.&#160; If Mrs. Charlie is expecting her fourth, it isn't
for us to repine."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"They breed and they also work," said
Margaret, conscious of some invitation to disloyalty, which was
echoed by the very breeze and by the songs of the birds.&#160; "It
certainly is a funny world, but so long as men like my husband and
his sons govern it, I think it'll never be a bad one--never really
bad."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, better'n nothing," said Miss Avery,
and turned to the wych-elm.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On their way back to the farm she spoke of
her old friend much more clearly than before.&#160; In the house
Margaret had wondered whether she quite distinguished the first
wife from the second.&#160; Now she said: "I never saw much of Ruth
after her grandmother died, but we stayed civil.&#160; It was a
very civil family.&#160; Old Mrs. Howard never spoke against
anybody, nor let anyone be turned away without food.&#160; Then it
was never 'Trespassers will be prosecuted' in their land, but would
people please not come in.&#160; Mrs. Howard was never created to
run a farm."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Had they no men to help them?" Margaret
asked.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Miss Avery replied: "Things went on until
there were no men."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Until Mr. Wilcox came along," corrected
Margaret, anxious that her husband should receive his dues.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I suppose so; but Ruth should have married
a--no disrespect to you to say this, for I take it you were
intended to get Wilcox any way, whether she got him first or
no."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Whom should she have married?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"A soldier!" exclaimed the old woman.&#160;
"Some real soldier."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret was silent.&#160; It was a
criticism of Henry's character far more trenchant than any of her
own.&#160; She felt dissatisfied.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But that's all over," she went on.&#160;
"A better time is coming now, though you've kept me long enough
waiting.&#160; In a couple of weeks I'll see your lights shining
through the hedge of an evening.&#160; Have you ordered in
coals?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We are not coming," said Margaret
firmly.&#160; She respected Miss Avery too much to humour
her.&#160; "No.&#160; Not coming.&#160; Never coming.&#160; It has
all been a mistake.&#160; The furniture must be repacked at once,
and I am very sorry but I am making other arrangements, and must
ask you to give me the keys."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Certainly, Mrs. Wilcox," said Miss Avery,
and resigned her duties with a smile.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Relieved at this conclusion, and having
sent her compliments to Madge, Margaret walked back to the
station.&#160; She had intended to go to the furniture warehouse
and give directions for removal, but the muddle had turned out more
extensive than she expected, so she decided to consult Henry.&#160;
It was as well that she did this.&#160; He was strongly against
employing the local man whom he had previously recommended, and
advised her to store in London after all.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But before this could be done an unexpected
trouble fell upon her.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 34</h3>
<p>It was not unexpected entirely.&#160; Aunt Juley's health had
been bad all the winter.&#160; She had had a long series of colds
and coughs, and had been too busy to get rid of them.&#160; She had
scarcely promised her niece "to really take my tiresome chest in
hand," when she caught a chill and developed acute pneumonia.&#160;
Margaret and Tibby went down to Swanage.&#160; Helen was
telegraphed for, and that spring party that after all gathered in
that hospitable house had all the pathos of fair memories.&#160; On
a perfect day, when the sky seemed blue porcelain, and the waves of
the discreet little bay beat gentlest of tattoos upon the sand,
Margaret hurried up through the rhododendrons, confronted again by
the senselessness of Death.&#160; One death may explain itself, but
it throws no light upon another: the groping inquiry must begin
anew.&#160; Preachers or scientists may generalize, but we know
that no generality is possible about those whom we love; not one
heaven awaits them, not even one oblivion.&#160; Aunt Juley,
incapable of tragedy, slipped out of life with odd little laughs
and apologies for having stopped in it so long.&#160; She was very
weak; she could not rise to the occasion, or realize the great
mystery which all agree must await her; it only seemed to her that
she was quite done up--more done up than ever before; that she saw
and heard and felt less every moment; and that, unless something
changed, she would soon feel nothing.&#160; Her spare strength she
devoted to plans: could not Margaret take some steamer
expeditions?&#160; were mackerel cooked as Tibby liked them?&#160;
She worried herself about Helen's absence, and also that she could
be the cause of Helen's return.&#160; The nurses seemed to think
such interests quite natural, and perhaps hers was an average
approach to the Great Gate.&#160; But Margaret saw Death stripped
of any false romance; whatever the idea of Death may contain, the
process can be trivial and hideous.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Important--Margaret dear, take the
Lulworth when Helen comes."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Helen won't be able to stop, Aunt
Juley.&#160; She has telegraphed that she can only get away just to
see you.&#160; She must go back to Germany as soon as you are
well."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How very odd of Helen!&#160; Mr.
Wilcox--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, dear?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Can he spare you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Henry wished her to come, and had been very
kind.&#160; Yet again Margaret said so.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Munt did not die.&#160; Quite outside
her will, a more dignified power took hold of her and checked her
on the downward slope.&#160; She returned, without emotion, as
fidgety as ever.&#160; On the fourth day she was out of
danger.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Margaret--important," it went on: "I
should like you to have some companion to take walks with.&#160; Do
try Miss Conder."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I have been a little walk with Miss
Conder."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But she is not really interesting.&#160;
If only you had Helen."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I have Tibby, Aunt Juley."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, but he has to do his Chinese.&#160;
Some real companion is what you need.&#160; Really, Helen is
odd."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Helen is odd, very," agreed
Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not content with going abroad, why does
she want to go back there at once?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No doubt she will change her mind when she
sees us.&#160; She has not the least balance."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That was the stock criticism about Helen,
but Margaret's voice trembled as she made it.&#160; By now she was
deeply pained at her sister's behaviour.&#160; It may be unbalanced
to fly out of England, but to stop away eight months argues that
the heart is awry as well as the head.&#160; A sick-bed could
recall Helen, but she was deaf to more human calls; after a glimpse
at her aunt, she would retire into her nebulous life behind some
poste restante.&#160; She scarcely existed; her letters had become
dull and infrequent; she had no wants and no curiosity.&#160; And
it was all put down to poor Henry's account!&#160; Henry, long
pardoned by his wife, was still too infamous to be greeted by his
sister-in-law.&#160; It was morbid, and, to her alarm, Margaret
fancied that she could trace the growth of morbidity back in
Helen's life for nearly four years.&#160; The flight from Oniton;
the unbalanced patronage of the Basts; the explosion of grief up on
the Downs--all connected with Paul, an insignificant boy whose lips
had kissed hers for a fraction of time.&#160; Margaret and Mrs.
Wilcox had feared that they might kiss again.&#160; Foolishly: the
real danger was reaction.&#160; Reaction against the Wilcoxes had
eaten into her life until she was scarcely sane.&#160; At
twenty-five she had an id&#233;e fixe.&#160; What hope was there
for her as an old woman?&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The more Margaret thought about it the more
alarmed she became.&#160; For many months she had put the subject
away, but it was too big to be slighted now.&#160; There was almost
a taint of madness.&#160; Were all Helen's actions to be governed
by a tiny mishap, such as may happen to any young man or
woman?&#160; Can human nature be constructed on lines so
insignificant?&#160; The blundering little encounter at Howards End
was vital.&#160; It propagated itself where graver intercourse lay
barren; it was stronger than sisterly intimacy, stronger than
reason or books.&#160; In one of her moods Helen had confessed that
she still "enjoyed" it in a certain sense.&#160; Paul had faded,
but the magic of his caress endured.&#160; And where there is
enjoyment of the past there may also be reaction--propagation at
both ends.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Well, it is odd and sad that our minds
should be such seed-beds, and we without power to choose the
seed.&#160; But man is an odd, sad creature as yet, intent on
pilfering the earth, and heedless of the growths within
himself.&#160; He cannot be bored about psychology.&#160; He leaves
it to the specialist, which is as if he should leave his dinner to
be eaten by a steam-engine.&#160; He cannot be bothered to digest
his own soul.&#160; Margaret and Helen have been more patient, and
it is suggested that Margaret has succeeded--so far as success is
yet possible.&#160; She does understand herself, she has some
rudimentary control over her own growth.&#160; Whether Helen has
succeeded one cannot say.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The day that Mrs. Munt rallied Helen's
letter arrived.&#160; She had posted it at Munich, and would be in
London herself on the morrow.&#160; It was a disquieting letter,
though the opening was affectionate and sane.</p>
<blockquote><strong><em>Dearest Meg,<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Give Helen's love to Aunt Juley.&#160; Tell
her that I love, and have loved, her ever since I can
remember.&#160; I shall be in London Thursday.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My address will be care of the
bankers.&#160; I have not yet settled on a hotel, so write or wire
to me there and give me detailed news.&#160; If Aunt Juley is much
better, or if, for a terrible reason, it would be no good my coming
down to Swanage, you must not think it odd if I do not come.&#160;
I have all sorts of plans in my head.&#160; I am living abroad at
present, and want to get back as quickly as possible.&#160; Will
you please tell me where our furniture is.&#160; I should like to
take out one or two books; the rest are for you.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Forgive me, dearest Meg.&#160; This must
read like rather a tiresome letter, but all letters are from your
loving</em></strong><br />
<div align="right"><strong><em>Helen</em></strong></div>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was a tiresome letter, for it tempted
Margaret to tell a lie.&#160; If she wrote that Aunt Juley was
still in danger her sister would come.&#160; Unhealthiness is
contagious.&#160; We cannot be in contact with those who are in a
morbid state without ourselves deteriorating.&#160; To "act for the
best" might do Helen good, but would do herself harm, and, at the
risk of disaster, she kept her colours flying a little
longer.&#160; She replied that their aunt was much better, and
awaited developments.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tibby approved of her reply.&#160;
Mellowing rapidly, he was a pleasanter companion than before.&#160;
Oxford had done much for him.&#160; He had lost his peevishness,
and could hide his indifference to people and his interest in
food.&#160; But he had not grown more human.&#160; The years
between eighteen and twenty-two, so magical for most, were leading
him gently from boyhood to middle age.&#160; He had never known
young-manliness, that quality which warms the heart till death, and
gives Mr. Wilcox an imperishable charm.&#160; He was frigid,
through no fault of his own, and without cruelty.&#160; He thought
Helen wrong and Margaret right, but the family trouble was for him
what a scene behind footlights is for most people.&#160; He had
only one suggestion to make, and that was characteristic.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why don't you tell Mr. Wilcox?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"About Helen?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Perhaps he has come across that sort of
thing."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He would do all he could, but--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, you know best.&#160; But he is
practical."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was the student's belief in
experts.&#160; Margaret demurred for one or two reasons.&#160;
Presently Helen's answer came.&#160; She sent a telegram requesting
the address of the furniture, as she would now return at
once.&#160; Margaret replied, "Certainly not; meet me at the
bankers at four." She and Tibby went up to London.&#160; Helen was
not at the bankers, and they were refused her address.&#160; Helen
had passed into chaos.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret put her arm round her
brother.&#160; He was all that she had left, and never had he
seemed more unsubstantial.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Tibby love, what next?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He replied: "It is extraordinary."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Dear, your judgment's often clearer than
mine.&#160; Have you any notion what's at the back?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"None, unless it's something mental."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh--that!" said Margaret.&#160; "Quite
impossible." But the suggestion had been uttered, and in a few
minutes she took it up herself.&#160; Nothing else explained.&#160;
And London agreed with Tibby.&#160; The mask fell off the city, and
she saw it for what it really is--a caricature of infinity.&#160;
The familiar barriers, the streets along which she moved, the
houses between which she had made her little journeys for so many
years, became negligible suddenly.&#160; Helen seemed one with
grimy trees and the traffic and the slowly-flowing slabs of
mud.&#160; She had accomplished a hideous act of renunciation and
returned to the One.&#160; Margaret's own faith held firm.&#160;
She knew the human soul will be merged, if it be merged at all,
with the stars and the sea.&#160; Yet she felt that her sister had
been going amiss for many years.&#160; It was symbolic the
catastrophe should come now, on a London afternoon, while rain fell
slowly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Henry was the only hope.&#160; Henry was
definite.&#160; He might know of some paths in the chaos that were
hidden from them, and she determined to take Tibby's advice and lay
the whole matter in his hands.&#160; They must call at his
office.&#160; He could not well make it worse.&#160; She went for a
few moments into St. Paul's, whose dome stands out of the welter so
bravely, as if preaching the gospel of form.&#160; But within,
St.&#160; Paul's is as its surroundings--echoes and whispers,
inaudible songs, invisible mosaics, wet footmarks crossing and
recrossing the floor.&#160; Si monumentum requiris, circumspice: it
points us back to London.&#160; There was no hope of Helen
here.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Henry was unsatisfactory at first.&#160;
That she had expected.&#160; He was overjoyed to see her back from
Swanage, and slow to admit the growth of a new trouble.&#160; When
they told him of their search, he only chaffed Tibby and the
Schlegels generally, and declared that it was "just like Helen" to
lead her relatives a dance.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That is what we all say," replied
Margaret.&#160; "But why should it be just like Helen?&#160; Why
should she be allowed to be so queer, and to grow queerer?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Don't ask me.&#160; I'm a plain man of
business.&#160; I live and let live.&#160; My advice to you both
is, don't worry.&#160; Margaret, you've got black marks again under
your eyes.&#160; You know that's strictly forbidden.&#160; First
your aunt--then your sister.&#160; No, we aren't going to have
it.&#160; Are we, Theobald?"&#160; He rang the bell.&#160; "I'll
give you some tea, and then you go straight to Ducie Street.&#160;
I can't have my girl looking as old as her husband."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"All the same, you have not quite seen our
point," said Tibby.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Wilcox, who was in good spirits,
retorted, "I don't suppose I ever shall."&#160; He leant back,
laughing at the gifted but ridiculous family, while the fire
flickered over the map of Africa.&#160; Margaret motioned to her
brother to go on.&#160; Rather diffident, he obeyed her.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Margaret's point is this," he said.&#160;
"Our sister may be mad."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles, who was working in the inner room,
looked round.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Come in, Charles," said Margaret
kindly.&#160; "Could you help us at all?&#160; We are again in
trouble."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'm afraid I cannot.&#160; What are the
facts?&#160; We are all mad more or less, you know, in these
days."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The facts are as follows," replied Tibby,
who had at times a pedantic lucidity.&#160; "The facts are that she
has been in England for three days and will not see us.&#160; She
has forbidden the bankers to give us her address.&#160; She refuses
to answer questions.&#160; Margaret finds her letters
colourless.&#160; There are other facts, but these are the most
striking."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She has never behaved like this before,
then?" asked Henry.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Of course not!" said his wife, with a
frown.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, my dear, how am I to know?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A senseless spasm of annoyance came over
her.&#160; "You know quite well that Helen never sins against
affection," she said.&#160; "You must have noticed that much in
her, surely."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh yes; she and I have always hit it off
together."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, Henry--can't you see?&#160;--I don't
mean that."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She recovered herself, but not before
Charles had observed her.&#160; Stupid and attentive, he was
watching the scene.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I was meaning that when she was eccentric
in the past, one could trace it back to the heart in the long
run.&#160; She behaved oddly because she cared for someone, or
wanted to help them.&#160; There's no possible excuse for her
now.&#160; She is grieving us deeply, and that is why I am sure
that she is not well.&#160; 'Mad' is too terrible a word, but she
is not well.&#160; I shall never believe it.&#160; I shouldn't
discuss my sister with you if I thought she was well--trouble you
about her, I mean."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Henry began to grow serious.&#160;
Ill-health was to him something perfectly definite.&#160; Generally
well himself, he could not realize that we sink to it by slow
gradations.&#160; The sick had no rights; they were outside the
pale; one could lie to them remorselessly.&#160; When his first
wife was seized, he had promised to take her down into
Hertfordshire, but meanwhile arranged with a nursing-home
instead.&#160; Helen, too, was ill.&#160; And the plan that he
sketched out for her capture, clever and well-meaning as it was,
drew its ethics from the wolf-pack.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You want to get hold of her?" he
said.&#160; "That's the problem, isn't it?&#160; She has got to see
a doctor."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"For all I know she has seen one
already."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, yes; don't interrupt."&#160; He rose
to his feet and thought intently.&#160; The genial, tentative host
disappeared, and they saw instead the man who had carved money out
of Greece and Africa, and bought forests from the natives for a few
bottles of gin.&#160; "I've got it," he said at last.&#160; "It's
perfectly easy.&#160; Leave it to me.&#160; We'll send her down to
Howards End."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How will you do that?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"After her books.&#160; Tell her that she
must unpack them herself.&#160; Then you can meet her there."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But, Henry, that's just what she won't let
me do.&#160; It's part of her--whatever it is--never to see
me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Of course you won't tell her you're
going.&#160; When she is there, looking at the cases, you'll just
stroll in.&#160; If nothing is wrong with her, so much the
better.&#160; But there'll be the motor round the corner, and we
can run her up to a specialist in no time."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret shook her head.&#160; "It's quite
impossible."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It doesn't seem impossible to me," said
Tibby; "it is surely a very tippy plan."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It is impossible, because--" She looked at
her husband sadly.&#160; "It's not the particular language that
Helen and I talk if you see my meaning.&#160; It would do
splendidly for other people, whom I don't blame."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But Helen doesn't talk," said Tibby.&#160;
"That's our whole difficulty.&#160; She won't talk your particular
language, and on that account you think she's ill."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, Henry; it's sweet of you, but I
couldn't."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I see," he said; "you have
scruples."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I suppose so."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And sooner than go against them you would
have your sister suffer.&#160; You could have got her down to
Swanage by a word, but you had scruples.&#160; And scruples are all
very well.&#160; I am as scrupulous as any man alive, I hope; but
when it is a case like this, when there is a question of
madness--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I deny it's madness."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You said just now--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's madness when I say it, but not when
you say it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Henry shrugged his shoulders.&#160;
"Margaret!&#160; Margaret!" he groaned.&#160; "No education can
teach a woman logic.&#160; Now, my dear, my time is valuable.&#160;
Do you want me to help you or not?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not in that way."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Answer my question.&#160; Plain question,
plain answer.&#160; Do--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles surprised them by
interrupting.&#160; "Pater, we may as well keep Howards End out of
it," he said.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why, Charles?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles could give no reason; but Margaret
felt as if, over tremendous distance, a salutation had passed
between them.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The whole house is at sixes and sevens,"
he said crossly.&#160; "We don't want any more mess."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Who's 'we'?" asked his father.&#160; "My
boy, pray, who's 'we'?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I am sure I beg your pardon," said
Charles.&#160; "I appear always to be intruding."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By now Margaret wished she had never
mentioned her trouble to her husband.&#160; Retreat was
impossible.&#160; He was determined to push the matter to a
satisfactory conclusion, and Helen faded as he talked.&#160; Her
fair, flying hair and eager eyes counted for nothing, for she was
ill, without rights, and any of her friends might hunt her.&#160;
Sick at heart, Margaret joined in the chase.&#160; She wrote her
sister a lying letter, at her husband's dictation; she said the
furniture was all at Howards End, but could be seen on Monday next
at 3 p.m., when a charwoman would be in attendance.&#160; It was a
cold letter, and the more plausible for that.&#160; Helen would
think she was offended.&#160; And on Monday next she and Henry were
to lunch with Dolly, and then ambush themselves in the
garden.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After they had gone, Mr. Wilcox said to his
son: "I can't have this sort of behaviour, my boy.&#160; Margaret's
too sweet-natured to mind, but I mind for her."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles made no answer.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Is anything wrong with you, Charles, this
afternoon?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, pater; but you may be taking on a
bigger business than you reckon."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Don't ask me."</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 35</h3>
<p>One speaks of the moods of spring, but the days that are her
true children have only one mood; they are all full of the rising
and dropping of winds, and the whistling of birds.&#160; New
flowers may come out, the green embroidery of the hedges increase,
but the same heaven broods overhead, soft, thick, and blue, the
same figures, seen and unseen, are wandering by coppice and
meadow.&#160; The morning that Margaret had spent with Miss Avery,
and the afternoon she set out to entrap Helen, were the scales of a
single balance.&#160; Time might never have moved, rain never have
fallen, and man alone, with his schemes and ailments, was troubling
Nature until he saw her through a veil of tears.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She protested no more.&#160; Whether Henry
was right or wrong, he was most kind, and she knew of no other
standard by which to judge him.&#160; She must trust him
absolutely.&#160; As soon as he had taken up a business, his
obtuseness vanished.&#160; He profited by the slightest
indications, and the capture of Helen promised to be staged as
deftly as the marriage of Evie.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They went down in the morning as arranged,
and he discovered that their victim was actually in Hilton.&#160;
On his arrival he called at all the livery-stables in the village,
and had a few minutes' serious conversation with the
proprietors.&#160; What he said, Margaret did not know--perhaps not
the truth; but news arrived after lunch that a lady had come by the
London train, and had taken a fly to Howards End.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She was bound to drive," said Henry.&#160;
"There will be her books.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I cannot make it out," said Margaret for
the hundredth time.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Finish your coffee, dear.&#160; We must be
off."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, Margaret, you know you must take
plenty," said Dolly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret tried, but suddenly lifted her
hand to her eyes.&#160; Dolly stole glances at her father-in-law
which he did not answer.&#160; In the silence the motor came round
to the door.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You're not fit for it," he said
anxiously.&#160; "Let me go alone.&#160; I know exactly what to
do."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh yes, I am fit," said Margaret,
uncovering her face.&#160; "Only most frightfully worried.&#160; I
cannot feel that Helen is really alive.&#160; Her letters and
telegrams seem to have come from someone else.&#160; Her voice
isn't in them.&#160; I don't believe your driver really saw her at
the station.&#160; I wish I'd never mentioned it.&#160; I know that
Charles is vexed.&#160; Yes, he is--" She seized Dolly's hand and
kissed it.&#160; "There, Dolly will forgive me.&#160; There.&#160;
Now we'll be off."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Henry had been looking at her
closely.&#160; He did not like this breakdown.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Don't you want to tidy yourself?" he
asked.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Have I time?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, plenty."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She went to the lavatory by the front door,
and as soon as the bolt slipped, Mr. Wilcox said quietly:<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Dolly, I'm going without her."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dolly's eyes lit up with vulgar
excitement.&#160; She followed him on tip-toe out to the car.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Tell her I thought it best."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, Mr. Wilcox, I see."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Say anything you like.&#160; All
right."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The car started well, and with ordinary
luck would have got away.&#160; But Porgly-woggles, who was playing
in the garden, chose this moment to sit down in the middle of the
path.&#160; Crane, in trying to pass him, ran one wheel over a bed
of wallflowers.&#160; Dolly screamed.&#160; Margaret, hearing the
noise, rushed out hatless, and was in time to jump on the
footboard.&#160; She said not a single word: he was only treating
her as she had treated Helen, and her rage at his dishonesty only
helped to indicate what Helen would feel against them.&#160; She
thought, "I deserve it: I am punished for lowering my colours." And
she accepted his apologies with a calmness that astonished
him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I still consider you are not fit for it,"
he kept saying.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Perhaps I was not at lunch.&#160; But the
whole thing is spread clearly before me now."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I was meaning to act for the best."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Just lend me your scarf, will you?&#160;
This wind takes one's hair so."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Certainly, dear girl.&#160; Are you all
right now?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Look!&#160; My hands have stopped
trembling."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And have quite forgiven me?&#160; Then
listen.&#160; Her cab should already have arrived at Howards End.
(We're a little late, but no matter.) Our first move will be to
send it down to wait at the farm, as, if possible, one doesn't want
a scene before servants.&#160; A certain gentleman"--he pointed at
Crane's back--"won't drive in, but will wait a little short of the
front gate, behind the laurels.&#160; Have you still the keys of
the house?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, they aren't wanted.&#160; Do you
remember how the house stands?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If we don't find her in the porch, we can
stroll round into the garden.&#160; Our object--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Here they stopped to pick up the
doctor.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I was just saying to my wife, Mansbridge,
that our main object is not to frighten Miss Schlegel.&#160; The
house, as you know, is my property, so it should seem quite natural
for us to be there.&#160; The trouble is evidently
nervous--wouldn't you say so, Margaret?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The doctor, a very young man, began to ask
questions about Helen.&#160; Was she normal?&#160; Was there
anything congenital or hereditary?&#160; Had anything occurred that
was likely to alienate her from her family?&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Nothing," answered Margaret, wondering
what would have happened if she had added: "Though she did resent
my husband's immorality."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She always was highly strung," pursued
Henry, leaning back in the car as it shot past the church.&#160; "A
tendency to spiritualism and those things, though nothing
serious.&#160; Musical, literary, artistic, but I should say
normal--a very charming girl."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret's anger and terror increased every
moment.&#160; How dare these men label her sister!&#160; What
horrors lay ahead!&#160; What impertinences that shelter under the
name of science!&#160; The pack was turning on Helen, to deny her
human rights, and it seemed to Margaret that all Schlegels were
threatened with her.&#160; "Were they normal?"&#160; What a
question to ask!&#160; And it is always those who know nothing
about human nature, who are bored by psychology and shocked by
physiology, who ask it.&#160; However piteous her sister's state,
she knew that she must be on her side.&#160; They would be mad
together if the world chose to consider them so.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was now five minutes past three.&#160;
The car slowed down by the farm, in the yard of which Miss Avery
was standing.&#160; Henry asked her whether a cab had gone
past.&#160; She nodded, and the next moment they caught sight of
it, at the end of the lane.&#160; The car ran silently like a beast
of prey.&#160; So unsuspicious was Helen that she was sitting on
the porch, with her back to the road.&#160; She had come.&#160;
Only her head and shoulders were visible.&#160; She sat framed in
the vine, and one of her hands played with the buds.&#160; The wind
ruffled her hair, the sun glorified it; she was as she had always
been.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret was seated next to the door.&#160;
Before her husband could prevent her, she slipped out.&#160; She
ran to the garden gate, which was shut, passed through it, and
deliberately pushed it in his face.&#160; The noise alarmed
Helen.&#160; Margaret saw her rise with an unfamiliar movement,
and, rushing into the porch, learnt the simple explanation of all
their fears--her sister was with child.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Is the truant all right?" called
Henry.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She had time to whisper: "Oh, my darling--"
The keys of the house were in her hand.&#160; She unlocked Howards
End and thrust Helen into it.&#160; "Yes, all right," she said, and
stood with her back to the door.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 36</h3>
<p>"Margaret, you look upset!" said Henry.&#160; Mansbridge had
followed.&#160; Crane was at the gate, and the flyman had stood up
on the box.&#160; Margaret shook her head at them; she could not
speak any more.&#160; She remained clutching the keys, as if all
their future depended on them.&#160; Henry was asking more
questions.&#160; She shook her head again.&#160; His words had no
sense.&#160; She heard him wonder why she had let Helen in.&#160;
"You might have given me a knock with the gate," was another of his
remarks.&#160; Presently she heard herself speaking.&#160; She, or
someone for her, said "Go away." Henry came nearer.&#160; He
repeated, "Margaret, you look upset again.&#160; My dear, give me
the keys.&#160; What are you doing with Helen?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, dearest, do go away, and I will manage
it all."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Manage what?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He stretched out his hand for the
keys.&#160; She might have obeyed if it had not been for the
doctor.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Stop that at least," she said piteously;
the doctor had turned back, and was questioning the driver of
Helen's cab.&#160; A new feeling came over her; she was fighting
for women against men.&#160; She did not care about rights, but if
men came into Howards End, it should be over her body.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Come, this is an odd beginning," said her
husband.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The doctor came forward now, and whispered
two words to Mr. Wilcox--the scandal was out.&#160; Sincerely
horrified, Henry stood gazing at the earth.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I cannot help it," said Margaret.&#160;
"Do wait.&#160; It's not my fault.&#160; Please all four of you to
go away now."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now the flyman was whispering to
Crane.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We are relying on you to help us, Mrs.
Wilcox," said the young doctor.&#160; "Could you go in and persuade
your sister to come out?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"On what grounds?" said Margaret, suddenly
looking him straight in the eyes.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thinking it professional to prevaricate, he
murmured something about a nervous breakdown.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I beg your pardon, but it is nothing of
the sort.&#160; You are not qualified to attend my sister, Mr.
Mansbridge.&#160; If we require your services, we will let you
know."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I can diagnose the case more bluntly if
you wish," he retorted.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You could, but you have not.&#160; You
are, therefore, not qualified to attend my sister."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Come, come, Margaret!" said Henry, never
raising his eyes.&#160; "This is a terrible business, an appalling
business.&#160; It's doctor's orders.&#160; Open the door."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Forgive me, but I will not."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't agree."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret was silent.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"This business is as broad as it's long,"
contributed the doctor.&#160; "We had better all work
together.&#160; You need us, Mrs. Wilcox, and we need you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Quite so," said Henry.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I do not need you in the least," said
Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two men looked at each other
anxiously.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No more does my sister, who is still many
weeks from her confinement."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Margaret, Margaret!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, Henry, send your doctor away.&#160;
What possible use is he now?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Wilcox ran his eye over the
house.&#160; He had a vague feeling that he must stand firm and
support the doctor.&#160; He himself might need support, for there
was trouble ahead.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It all turns on affection now," said
Margaret.&#160; "Affection.&#160; Don't you see?"&#160; Resuming
her usual methods, she wrote the word on the house with her
finger.&#160; "Surely you see.&#160; I like Helen very much, you
not so much.&#160; Mr. Mansbridge doesn't know her.&#160; That's
all.&#160; And affection, when reciprocated, gives rights.&#160;
Put that down in your notebook, Mr. Mansbridge.&#160; It's a useful
formula."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Henry told her to be calm.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You don't know what you want yourselves,"
said Margaret, folding her arms.&#160; "For one sensible remark I
will let you in.&#160; But you cannot make it.&#160; You would
trouble my sister for no reason.&#160; I will not permit it.&#160;
I'll stand here all the day sooner."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Mansbridge," said Henry in a low voice,
"perhaps not now."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The pack was breaking up.&#160; At a sign
from his master, Crane also went back into the car.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Now, Henry, you," she said gently.&#160;
None of her bitterness had been directed at him.&#160; "Go away
now, dear.&#160; I shall want your advice later, no doubt.&#160;
Forgive me if I have been cross.&#160; But, seriously, you must
go."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He was too stupid to leave her.&#160; Now
it was Mr. Mansbridge who called in a low voice to him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I shall soon find you down at Dolly's,"
she called, as the gate at last clanged between them.&#160; The fly
moved out of the way, the motor backed, turned a little, backed
again, and turned in the narrow road.&#160; A string of farm carts
came up in the middle; but she waited through all, for there was no
hurry.&#160; When all was over and the car had started, she opened
the door.&#160; "Oh, my darling!" she said.&#160; "My darling,
forgive me." Helen was standing in the hall.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 37</h3>
<p>Margaret bolted the door on the inside.&#160; Then she would
have kissed her sister, but Helen, in a dignified voice, that came
strangely from her, said:<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Convenient!&#160; You did not tell me that
the books were unpacked.&#160; I have found nearly everything that
I want.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I told you nothing that was true."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It has been a great surprise,
certainly.&#160; Has Aunt Juley been ill?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Helen, you wouldn't think I'd invent
that?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I suppose not," said Helen, turning away,
and crying a very little.&#160; "But one loses faith in everything
after this."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We thought it was illness, but even
then--I haven't behaved worthily."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen selected another book.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I ought not to have consulted
anyone.&#160; What would our father have thought of me?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She did not think of questioning her
sister, nor of rebuking her.&#160; Both might be necessary in the
future, but she had first to purge a greater crime than any that
Helen could have committed--that want of confidence that is the
work of the devil.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, I am annoyed," replied Helen.&#160;
"My wishes should have been respected.&#160; I would have gone
through this meeting if it was necessary, but after Aunt Juley
recovered, it was not necessary.&#160; Planning my life, as I now
have to do--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Come away from those books," called
Margaret.&#160; "Helen, do talk to me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I was just saying that I have stopped
living haphazard.&#160; One can't go through a great deal of"--she
missed out the noun--"without planning one's actions in
advance.&#160; I am going to have a child in June, and in the first
place conversations, discussions, excitement, are not good for
me.&#160; I will go through them if necessary, but only then.&#160;
In the second place I have no right to trouble people.&#160; I
cannot fit in with England as I know it.&#160; I have done
something that the English never pardon.&#160; It would not be
right for them to pardon it.&#160; So I must live where I am not
known."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But why didn't you tell me,
dearest?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes," replied Helen judicially.&#160; "I
might have, but decided to wait."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;" I believe you would never have told
me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh yes, I should.&#160; We have taken a
flat in Munich."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret glanced out of window.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"By 'we' I mean myself and Monica.&#160;
But for her, I am and have been and always wish to be alone."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I have not heard of Monica."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You wouldn't have.&#160; She's an
Italian--by birth at least.&#160; She makes her living by
journalism.&#160; I met her originally on Garda.&#160; Monica is
much the best person to see me through."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You are very fond of her, then."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She has been extraordinarily sensible with
me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret guessed at Monica's
type--"Italiano Inglesiato" they had named it: the crude feminist
of the South, whom one respects but avoids.&#160; And Helen had
turned to it in her need!&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You must not think that we shall never
meet," said Helen, with a measured kindness.&#160; "I shall always
have a room for you when you can be spared, and the longer you can
be with me the better.&#160; But you haven't understood yet, Meg,
and of course it is very difficult for you.&#160; This is a shock
to you.&#160; It isn't to me, who have been thinking over our
futures for many months, and they won't be changed by a slight
contretemps, such as this.&#160; I cannot live in England."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Helen, you've not forgiven me for my
treachery.&#160; You <em>couldn't</em> talk like this to me if you
had."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, Meg dear, why do we talk at
all?"&#160; She dropped a book and sighed wearily.&#160; Then,
recovering herself, she said: "Tell me, how is it that all the
books are down here?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Series of mistakes."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And a great deal of the furniture has been
unpacked."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"All."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Who lives here, then?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No one."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I suppose you are letting it
though--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The house is dead," said Margaret with a
frown.&#160; "Why worry on about it?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But I am interested.&#160; You talk as if
I had lost all my interest in life.&#160; I am still Helen, I
hope.&#160; Now this hasn't the feel of a dead house.&#160; The
hall seems more alive even than in the old days, when it held the
Wilcoxes' own things."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Interested, are you?&#160; Very well, I
must tell you, I suppose.&#160; My husband lent it on condition
we--but by a mistake all our things were unpacked, and Miss Avery,
instead of--" She stopped.&#160; "Look here, I can't go on like
this.&#160; I warn you I won't.&#160; Helen, why should you be so
miserably unkind to me, simply because you hate Henry?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't hate him now," said Helen.&#160;
"I have stopped being a schoolgirl, and, Meg, once again, I'm not
being unkind.&#160; But as for fitting in with your English
life--no, put it out of your head at once.&#160; Imagine a visit
from me at Ducie Street!&#160; It's unthinkable."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret could not contradict her.&#160; It
was appalling to see her quietly moving forward with her plans, not
bitter or excitable, neither asserting innocence nor confessing
guilt, merely desiring freedom and the company of those who would
not blame her.&#160; She had been through--how much?&#160; Margaret
did not know.&#160; But it was enough to part her from old habits
as well as old friends.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Tell me about yourself," said Helen, who
had chosen her books, and was lingering over the furniture.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There's nothing to tell."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But your marriage has been happy,
Meg?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, but I don't feel inclined to
talk."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You feel as I do."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not that, but I can't."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No more can I.&#160; It is a nuisance, but
no good trying."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Something had come between them.&#160;
Perhaps it was Society, which henceforward would exclude
Helen.&#160; Perhaps it was a third life, already potent as a
spirit.&#160; They could find no meeting-place.&#160; Both suffered
acutely, and were not comforted by the knowledge that affection
survived.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Look here, Meg, is the coast clear?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You mean that you want to go away from
me?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I suppose so--dear old lady!&#160; it
isn't any use.&#160; I knew we should have nothing to say.&#160;
Give my love to Aunt Juley and Tibby, and take more yourself than I
can say.&#160; Promise to come and see me in Munich later."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Certainly, dearest."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"For that is all we can do."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It seemed so.&#160; Most ghastly of all was
Helen's common sense: Monica had been extraordinarily good for
her.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I am glad to have seen you and the
things."&#160; She looked at the bookcase lovingly, as if she was
saying farewell to the past.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret unbolted the door.&#160; She
remarked: "The car has gone, and here's your cab."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She led the way to it, glancing at the
leaves and the sky.&#160; The spring had never seemed more
beautiful.&#160; The driver, who was leaning on the gate, called
out, "Please, lady, a message," and handed her Henry's
visiting-card through the bars.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How did this come?" she asked.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Crane had returned with it almost at
once.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She read the card with annoyance.&#160; It
was covered with instructions in domestic French.&#160; When she
and her sister had talked she was to come back for the night to
Dolly's.&#160; "Il faut dormir sur ce sujet." While Helen was to be
found "une comfortable chambre &#224; l'h&#244;tel." The final
sentence displeased her greatly until she remembered that the
Charles' had only one spare room, and so could not invite a third
guest.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Henry would have done what he could," she
interpreted.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen had not followed her into the
garden.&#160; The door once open, she lost her inclination to
fly.&#160; She remained in the hall, going from bookcase to
table.&#160; She grew more like the old Helen, irresponsible and
charming.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"This is Mr. Wilcox's house?" she
inquired.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Surely you remember Howards End?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Remember?&#160; I who remember
everything!&#160; But it looks to be ours now."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Miss Avery was extraordinary," said
Margaret, her own spirits lightening a little.&#160; Again she was
invaded by a slight feeling of disloyalty.&#160; But it brought her
relief, and she yielded to it.&#160; "She loved Mrs. Wilcox, and
would rather furnish her house with our things than think of it
empty.&#160; In consequence here are all the library
books.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not all the books.&#160; She hasn't
unpacked the Art Books, in which she may show her sense.&#160; And
we never used to have the sword here."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The sword looks well, though."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Magnificent."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, doesn't it?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Where's the piano, Meg?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I warehoused that in London.&#160;
Why?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Nothing."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Curious, too, that the carpet fits."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The carpet's a mistake," announced
Helen.&#160; "I know that we had it in London, but this floor ought
to be bare.&#160; It is far too beautiful."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You still have a mania for
under-furnishing.&#160; Would you care to come into the dining-room
before you start?&#160; There's no carpet there.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They went in, and each minute their talk
became more natural.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, <em>what</em> a place for mother's
chiffonier!" cried Helen.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Look at the chairs, though."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, look at them!&#160; Wickham Place
faced north, didn't it?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"North-west."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Anyhow, it is thirty years since any of
those chairs have felt the sun.&#160; Feel.&#160; Their little
backs are quite warm."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But why has Miss Avery made them set to
partners?&#160; I shall just--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Over here, Meg.&#160; Put it so that any
one sitting will see the lawn."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret moved a chair.&#160; Helen sat
down in it.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ye-es.&#160; The window's too high."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Try a drawing-room chair."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, I don't like the drawing-room so
much.&#160; The beam has been match-boarded.&#160; It would have
been so beautiful otherwise.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Helen, what a memory you have for some
things!&#160; You're perfectly right.&#160; It's a room that men
have spoilt through trying to make it nice for women.&#160; Men
don't know what we want--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And never will."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't agree.&#160; In two thousand years
they'll know."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But the chairs show up wonderfully.&#160;
Look where Tibby spilt the soup."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Coffee.&#160; It was coffee surely."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen shook her head.&#160;
"Impossible.&#160; Tibby was far too young to be given coffee at
that time."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Was Father alive?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then you're right and it must have been
soup.&#160; I was thinking of much later--that unsuccessful visit
of Aunt Juley's, when she didn't realize that Tibby had grown
up.&#160; It was coffee then, for he threw it down on
purpose.&#160; There was some rhyme, 'Tea, coffee--coffee, tea,'
that she said to him every morning at breakfast.&#160; Wait a
minute--how did it go?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I know--no, I don't.&#160; What a
detestable boy Tibby was!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But the rhyme was simply awful.&#160; No
decent person could have put up with it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ah, that greengage tree," cried Helen, as
if the garden was also part of their childhood.&#160; "Why do I
connect it with dumbbells?&#160; And there come the chickens.&#160;
The grass wants cutting.&#160; I love yellow-hammers--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret interrupted her.&#160; "I have got
it," she announced.</p>
<blockquote><em>'Tea, tea, coffee, tea,<br />
Or chocolaritee.'</em></blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That every morning for three
weeks.&#160; No wonder Tibby was wild."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Tibby is moderately a dear now," said
Helen.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There!&#160; I knew you'd say that in the
end.&#160; Of course he's a dear."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A bell rang.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Listen!&#160; what's that?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen said, "Perhaps the Wilcoxes are
beginning the siege."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What nonsense--listen!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And the triviality faded from their faces,
though it left something behind--the knowledge that they never
could be parted because their love was rooted in common
things.&#160; Explanations and appeals had failed; they had tried
for a common meeting-ground, and had only made each other
unhappy.&#160; And all the time their salvation was lying round
them--the past sanctifying the present; the present, with wild
heart-throb, declaring that there would after all be a future, with
laughter and the voices of children.&#160; Helen, still smiling,
came up to her sister.&#160; She said, "It is always Meg." They
looked into each other's eyes.&#160; The inner life had paid.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Solemnly the clapper tolled.&#160; No one
was in the front.&#160; Margaret went to the kitchen, and struggled
between packing-cases to the window.&#160; Their visitor was only a
little boy with a tin can.&#160; And triviality returned.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Little boy, what do you want?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Please, I am the milk."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Did Miss Avery send you?" said Margaret,
rather sharply.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, please."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then take it back and say we require no
milk." While she called to Helen, "No, it's not the siege, but
possibly an attempt to provision us against one."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But I like milk," cried Helen.&#160; "Why
send it away?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do you?&#160; Oh, very well.&#160; But
we've nothing to put it in, and he wants the can."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Please, I'm to call in the morning for the
can," said the boy.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The house will be locked up then."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In the morning would I bring eggs,
too?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Are you the boy whom I saw playing in the
stacks last week?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The child hung his head.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, run away and do it again."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Nice little boy," whispered Helen.&#160;
"I say, what's your name?&#160; Mine's Helen."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Tom."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That was Helen all over.&#160; The
Wilcoxes, too, would ask a child its name, but they never told
their names in return.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Tom, this one here is Margaret.&#160; And
at home we've another called Tibby."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Mine are lop-eared," replied Tom,
supposing Tibby to be a rabbit.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You're a very good and rather a clever
little boy.&#160; Mind you come again.--Isn't he charming?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Undoubtedly," said Margaret. "He is
probably the son of Madge, and Madge is dreadful.&#160; But this
place has wonderful powers."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What do you mean?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't know."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Because I probably agree with you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It kills what is dreadful and makes what
is beautiful live."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I do agree," said Helen, as she sipped the
milk.&#160; "But you said that the house was dead not half an hour
ago."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Meaning that I was dead.&#160; I felt
it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, the house has a surer life than we,
even if it was empty, and, as it is, I can't get over that for
thirty years the sun has never shone full on our furniture.&#160;
After all, Wickham Place was a grave.&#160; Meg, I've a startling
idea."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What is it?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Drink some milk to steady you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret obeyed.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, I won't tell you yet," said Helen,
"because you may laugh or be angry.&#160; Let's go upstairs first
and give the rooms an airing."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They opened window after window, till the
inside, too, was rustling to the spring.&#160; Curtains blew,
picture-frames tapped cheerfully.&#160; Helen uttered cries of
excitement as she found this bed obviously in its right place, that
in its wrong one.&#160; She was angry with Miss Avery for not
having moved the wardrobes up.&#160; "Then one would see really."
She admired the view.&#160; She was the Helen who had written the
memorable letters four years ago.&#160; As they leant out, looking
westward, she said: "About my idea.&#160; Couldn't you and I camp
out in this house for the night?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't think we could well do that," said
Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Here are beds, tables, towels--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I know; but the house isn't supposed to be
slept in, and Henry's suggestion was--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I require no suggestions.&#160; I shall
not alter anything in my plans.&#160; But it would give me so much
pleasure to have one night here with you.&#160; It will be
something to look back on.&#160; Oh, Meg lovey, do let's!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But, Helen, my pet," said Margaret, "we
can't without getting Henry's leave.&#160; Of course, he would give
it, but you said yourself that you couldn't visit at Ducie Street
now, and this is equally intimate."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ducie Street is his house.&#160; This is
ours.&#160; Our furniture, our sort of people coming to the
door.&#160; Do let us camp out, just one night, and Tom shall feed
us on eggs and milk.&#160; Why not?&#160; It's a moon."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret hesitated.&#160; "I feel Charles
wouldn't like it," she said at last.&#160; "Even our furniture
annoyed him, and I was going to clear it out when Aunt Juley's
illness prevented me.&#160; I sympathize with Charles.&#160; He
feels it's his mother's house.&#160; He loves it in rather an
untaking way.&#160; Henry I could answer for--not Charles."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I know he won't like it," said
Helen.&#160; "But I am going to pass out of their lives.&#160; What
difference will it make in the long run if they say, 'And she even
spent the night at Howards End'?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How do you know you'll pass out of their
lives?&#160; We have thought that twice before."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Because my plans--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"--which you change in a moment."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then because my life is great and theirs
are little," said Helen, taking fire.&#160; "I know of things they
can't know of, and so do you.&#160; We know that there's
poetry.&#160; We know that there's death.&#160; They can only take
them on hearsay.&#160; We know this is our house, because it feels
ours.&#160; Oh, they may take the title-deeds and the doorkeys, but
for this one night we are at home."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It would be lovely to have you once more
alone," said Margaret.&#160; "It may be a chance in a
thousand."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, and we could talk." She dropped her
voice.&#160; "It won't be a very glorious story.&#160; But under
that wych-elm--honestly, I see little happiness ahead.&#160; Cannot
I have this one night with you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I needn't say how much it would mean to
me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then let us."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It is no good hesitating.&#160; Shall I
drive down to Hilton now and get leave?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, we don't want leave."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Margaret was a loyal wife.&#160; In
spite of imagination and poetry--perhaps on account of them--she
could sympathize with the technical attitude that Henry would
adopt.&#160; If possible, she would be technical, too.&#160; A
night's lodging--and they demanded no more--need not involve the
discussion of general principles.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Charles may say no," grumbled Helen.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We shan't consult him."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Go if you like; I should have stopped
without leave."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was the touch of selfishness, which was
not enough to mar Helen's character, and even added to its
beauty.&#160; She would have stopped without leave, and escaped to
Germany the next morning.&#160; Margaret kissed her.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Expect me back before dark.&#160; I am
looking forward to it so much.&#160; It is like you to have thought
of such a beautiful thing."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not a thing, only an ending," said Helen
rather sadly; and the sense of tragedy closed in on Margaret again
as soon as she left the house.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She was afraid of Miss Avery.&#160; It is
disquieting to fulfil a prophecy, however superficially.&#160; She
was glad to see no watching figure as she drove past the farm, but
only little Tom, turning somersaults in the straw.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 38</h3>
<p>The tragedy began quietly enough, and like many another talk, by
the man's deft assertion of his superiority.&#160; Henry heard her
arguing with the driver, stepped out and settled the fellow, who
was inclined to be rude, and then led the way to some chairs on the
lawn.&#160; Dolly, who had not been "told," ran out with offers of
tea.&#160; He refused them, and ordered her to wheel baby's
perambulator away, as they desired to be alone.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But the diddums can't listen; he isn't
nine months old," she pleaded.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's not what I was saying," retorted
her father-in-law.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Baby was wheeled out of earshot, and did
not hear about the crisis till later years.&#160; It was now the
turn of Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Is it what we feared?" he asked.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It is."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Dear girl," he began, "there is a
troublesome business ahead of us, and nothing but the most absolute
honesty and plain speech will see us through." Margaret bent her
head.&#160; "I am obliged to question you on subjects we'd both
prefer to leave untouched.&#160; As you know, I am not one of your
Bernard Shaws who consider nothing sacred.&#160; To speak as I must
will pain me, but there are occasions--We are husband and wife, not
children.&#160; I am a man of the world, and you are a most
exceptional woman."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All Margaret's senses forsook her.&#160;
She blushed, and looked past him at the Six Hills, covered with
spring herbage.&#160; Noting her colour, he grew still more
kind.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I see that you feel as I felt when--My
poor little wife!&#160; Oh, be brave!&#160; Just one or two
questions, and I have done with you.&#160; Was your sister wearing
a wedding-ring?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret stammered a "No."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There was an appalling silence.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Henry, I really came to ask a favour about
Howards End."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"One point at a time.&#160; I am now
obliged to ask for the name of her seducer."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She rose to her feet and held the chair
between them.&#160; Her colour had ebbed, and she was grey.&#160;
It did not displease him that she should receive his question
thus.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Take your time," he counselled her.&#160;
"Remember that this is far worse for me than for you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She swayed; he feared she was going to
faint.&#160; Then speech came, and she said slowly: "Seducer?&#160;
No; I do not know her seducer's name."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Would she not tell you?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I never even asked her who seduced her,"
said Margaret, dwelling on the hateful word thoughtfully.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That is singular." Then he changed his
mind.&#160; "Natural perhaps, dear girl, that you shouldn't
ask.&#160; But until his name is known, nothing can be done.&#160;
Sit down.&#160; How terrible it is to see you so upset!&#160; I
knew you weren't fit for it.&#160; I wish I hadn't taken
you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret answered, "I like to stand, if you
don't mind, for it gives me a pleasant view of the Six
Hills."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"As you like."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Have you anything else to ask me,
Henry?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Next you must tell me whether you have
gathered anything.&#160; I have often noticed your insight,
dear.&#160; I only wish my own was as good.&#160; You may have
guessed something, even though your sister said nothing.&#160; The
slightest hint would help us."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Who is 'we'?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I thought it best to ring up
Charles."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That was unnecessary," said Margaret,
growing warmer.&#160; "This news will give Charles disproportionate
pain."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He has at once gone to call on your
brother."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That too was unnecessary."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Let me explain, dear, how the matter
stands.&#160; You don't think that I and my son are other than
gentlemen?&#160; It is in Helen's interests that we are
acting.&#160; It is still not too late to save her name."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then Margaret hit out for the first
time.&#160; "Are we to make her seducer marry her?" she
asked.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If possible.&#160; Yes."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But, Henry, suppose he turned out to be
married already?&#160; One has heard of such cases."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In that case he must pay heavily for his
misconduct, and be thrashed within an inch of his life."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So her first blow missed.&#160; She was
thankful of it.&#160; What had tempted her to imperil both of their
lives?&#160; Henry's obtuseness had saved her as well as
himself.&#160; Exhausted with anger, she sat down again, blinking
at him as he told her as much as he thought fit.&#160; At last she
said: "May I ask you my question now?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Certainly, my dear."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Tomorrow Helen goes to Munich--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, possibly she is right."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Henry, let a lady finish.&#160; Tomorrow
she goes; tonight, with your permission, she would like to sleep at
Howards End."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was the crisis of his life.&#160; Again
she would have recalled the words as soon as they were
uttered.&#160; She had not led up to them with sufficient
care.&#160; She longed to warn him that they were far more
important than he supposed.&#160; She saw him weighing them, as if
they were a business proposition.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why Howards End?" he said at last.&#160;
"Would she not be more comfortable, as I suggested, at the
hotel?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret hastened to give him
reasons.&#160; "It is an odd request, but you know what Helen is
and what women in her state are." He frowned, and moved
irritably.&#160; "She has the idea that one night in your house
would give her pleasure and do her good.&#160; I think she's
right.&#160; Being one of those imaginative girls, the presence of
all our books and furniture soothes her.&#160; This is a
fact.&#160; It is the end of her girlhood.&#160; Her last words to
me were, 'A beautiful ending.'"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She values the old furniture for
sentimental reasons, in fact."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Exactly.&#160; You have quite
understood.&#160; It is her last hope of being with it."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't agree there, my dear!&#160; Helen
will have her share of the goods wherever she goes--possibly more
than her share, for you are so fond of her that you'd give her
anything of yours that she fancies, wouldn't you?&#160; and I'd
raise no objection.&#160; I could understand it if it was her old
home, because a home, or a house"--he changed the word, designedly;
he had thought of a telling point--"because a house in which one
has once lived becomes in a sort of way sacred, I don't know
why.&#160; Associations and so on.&#160; Now Helen has no
associations with Howards End, though I and Charles and Evie
have.&#160; I do not see why she wants to stay the night
there.&#160; She will only catch cold."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Leave it that you don't see," cried
Margaret.&#160; "Call it fancy.&#160; But realize that fancy is a
scientific fact.&#160; Helen is fanciful, and wants to."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then he surprised her--a rare
occurrence.&#160; He shot an unexpected bolt.&#160; "If she wants
to sleep one night, she may want to sleep two.&#160; We shall never
get her out of the house, perhaps."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well?" said Margaret, with the precipice
in sight.&#160; "And suppose we don't get her out of the
house?&#160; Would it matter?&#160; She would do no one any
harm."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Again the irritated gesture.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, Henry," she panted, receding.&#160; "I
didn't mean that.&#160; We will only trouble Howards End for this
one night.&#160; I take her to London tomorrow--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do you intend to sleep in a damp house,
too?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She cannot be left alone."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's quite impossible!&#160;
Madness.&#160; You must be here to meet Charles."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I have already told you that your message
to Charles was unnecessary, and I have no desire to meet
him."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Margaret--my Margaret--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What has this business to do with
Charles?&#160; If it concerns me little, it concerns you less, and
Charles not at all."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"As the future owner of Howards End," said
Mr. Wilcox, arching his fingers, "I should say that it did concern
Charles."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In what way?&#160; Will Helen's condition
depreciate the property?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"My dear, you are forgetting
yourself."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I think you yourself recommended plain
speaking."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They looked at each other in
amazement.&#160; The precipice was at their feet now.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Helen commands my sympathy," said
Henry.&#160; "As your husband, I shall do all for her that I can,
and I have no doubt that she will prove more sinned against than
sinning.&#160; But I cannot treat her as if nothing has
happened.&#160; I should be false to my position in society if I
did."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She controlled herself for the last
time.&#160; "No, let us go back to Helen's request," she
said.&#160; "It is unreasonable, but the request of an unhappy
girl.&#160; Tomorrow she will go to Germany, and trouble society no
longer.&#160; Tonight she asks to sleep in your empty house--a
house which you do not care about, and which you have not occupied
for over a year.&#160; May she?&#160; Will you give my sister
leave?&#160; Will you forgive her--as you hope to be forgiven, and
as you have actually been forgiven?&#160; Forgive her for one night
only.&#160; That will be enough."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"As I have actually been forgiven--?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Never mind for the moment what I mean by
that," said Margaret.&#160; "Answer my question."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps some hint of her meaning did dawn
on him.&#160; If so, he blotted it out.&#160; Straight from his
fortress he answered: "I seem rather unaccommodating, but I have
some experience of life, and know how one thing leads to
another.&#160; I am afraid that your sister had better sleep at the
hotel.&#160; I have my children and the memory of my dear wife to
consider.&#160; I am sorry, but see that she leaves my house at
once."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You mentioned Mrs. Wilcox."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I beg your pardon?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"A rare occurrence.&#160; In reply, may I
mention Mrs. Bast?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You have not been yourself all day," said
Henry, and rose from his seat with face unmoved.&#160; Margaret
rushed at him and seized both his hands.&#160; She was
transfigured.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not any more of this!" she cried.&#160;
"You shall see the connection if it kills you, Henry!&#160; You
have had a mistress--I forgave you.&#160; My sister has a
lover--you drive her from the house.&#160; Do you see the
connection?&#160; Stupid, hypocritical, cruel--oh,
contemptible!&#160;--a man who insults his wife when she's alive
and cants with her memory when she's dead.&#160; A man who ruins a
woman for his pleasure, and casts her off to ruin other men.&#160;
And gives bad financial advice, and then says he is not
responsible.&#160; These, man, are you.&#160; You can't recognize
them, because you cannot connect.&#160; I've had enough of your
unweeded kindness.&#160; I've spoilt you long enough.&#160; All
your life you have been spoiled.&#160; Mrs. Wilcox spoiled
you.&#160; No one has ever told what you are--muddled, criminally
muddled.&#160; Men like you use repentance as a blind, so don't
repent.&#160; Only say to yourself, 'What Helen has done, I've
done.'"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The two cases are different," Henry
stammered.&#160; His real retort was not quite ready.&#160; His
brain was still in a whirl, and he wanted a little longer.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In what way different?&#160; You have
betrayed Mrs. Wilcox, Helen only herself.&#160; You remain in
society, Helen can't.&#160; You have had only pleasure, she may
die.&#160; You have the insolence to talk to me of differences,
Henry?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Oh, the uselessness of it!&#160; Henry's
retort came.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I perceive you are attempting
blackmail.&#160; It is scarcely a pretty weapon for a wife to use
against her husband.&#160; My rule through life has been never to
pay the least attention to threats, and I can only repeat what I
said before: I do not give you and your sister leave to sleep at
Howards End."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret loosed his hands.&#160; He went
into the house, wiping first one and then the other on his
handkerchief.&#160; For a little she stood looking at the Six
Hills, tombs of warriors, breasts of the spring.&#160; Then she
passed out into what was now the evening.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 39</h3>
<p>Charles and Tibby met at Ducie Street, where the latter was
staying.&#160; Their interview was short and absurd.&#160; They had
nothing in common but the English language, and tried by its help
to express what neither of them understood.&#160; Charles saw in
Helen the family foe.&#160; He had singled her out as the most
dangerous of the Schlegels, and, angry as he was, looked forward to
telling his wife how right he had been.&#160; His mind was made up
at once: the girl must be got out of the way before she disgraced
them farther.&#160; If occasion offered she might be married to a
villain or, possibly, to a fool.&#160; But this was a concession to
morality, it formed no part of his main scheme.&#160; Honest and
hearty was Charles's dislike, and the past spread itself out very
clearly before him; hatred is a skilful compositor.&#160; As if
they were heads in a note-book, he ran through all the incidents of
the Schlegels' campaign: the attempt to compromise his brother, his
mother's legacy, his father's marriage, the introduction of the
furniture, the unpacking of the same.&#160; He had not yet heard of
the request to sleep at Howards End; that was to be their
master-stroke and the opportunity for his.&#160; But he already
felt that Howards End was the objective, and, though he disliked
the house, was determined to defend it.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tibby, on the other hand, had no
opinions.&#160; He stood above the conventions: his sister had a
right to do what she thought right.&#160; It is not difficult to
stand above the conventions when we leave no hostages among them;
men can always be more unconventional than women, and a bachelor of
independent means need encounter no difficulties at all.&#160;
Unlike Charles, Tibby had money enough; his ancestors had earned it
for him, and if he shocked the people in one set of lodgings he had
only to move into another.&#160; His was the leisure without
sympathy--an attitude as fatal as the strenuous: a little cold
culture may be raised on it, but no art.&#160; His sisters had seen
the family danger, and had never forgotten to discount the gold
islets that raised them from the sea.&#160; Tibby gave all the
praise to himself, and so despised the struggling and the
submerged.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hence the absurdity of the interview; the
gulf between them was economic as well as spiritual.&#160; But
several facts passed: Charles pressed for them with an impertinence
that the undergraduate could not withstand.&#160; On what date had
Helen gone abroad?&#160; To whom?&#160; (Charles was anxious to
fasten the scandal on Germany.) Then, changing his tactics, he said
roughly: "I suppose you realize that you are your sister's
protector?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In what sense?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If a man played about with my sister, I'd
send a bullet through him, but perhaps you don't mind."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I mind very much," protested Tibby.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Who d'ye suspect, then?&#160; Speak out,
man.&#160; One always suspects someone."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No one.&#160; I don't think so."
Involuntarily he blushed.&#160; He had remembered the scene in his
Oxford rooms.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You are hiding something," said
Charles.&#160; As interviews go, he got the best of this one.&#160;
"When you saw her last, did she mention anyone's name?&#160; Yes,
or no!" he thundered, so that Tibby started.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In my rooms she mentioned some friends,
called the Basts--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Who are the Basts?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"People--friends of hers at Evie's
wedding."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't remember.&#160; But, by great
Scott!&#160; I do.&#160; My aunt told me about some tag-rag.&#160;
Was she full of them when you saw her?&#160; Is there a man?&#160;
Did she speak of the man?&#160; Or--look here--have you had any
dealings with him?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tibby was silent.&#160; Without intending
it, he had betrayed his sister's confidence; he was not enough
interested in human life to see where things will lead to.&#160; He
had a strong regard for honesty, and his word, once given, had
always been kept up to now.&#160; He was deeply vexed, not only for
the harm he had done Helen, but for the flaw he had discovered in
his own equipment.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I see--you are in his confidence.&#160;
They met at your rooms.&#160; Oh, what a family, what a
family!&#160; God help the poor pater--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And Tibby found himself alone.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 40</h3>
<p>Leonard--he would figure at length in a newspaper report, but
that evening he did not count for much.&#160; The foot of the tree
was in shadow, since the moon was still hidden behind the
house.&#160; But above, to right, to left, down the long meadow the
moonlight was streaming.&#160; Leonard seemed not a man, but a
cause.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps it was Helen's way of falling in
love--a curious way to Margaret, whose agony and whose contempt of
Henry were yet imprinted with his image.&#160; Helen forgot
people.&#160; They were husks that had enclosed her emotion.&#160;
She could pity, or sacrifice herself, or have instincts, but had
she ever loved in the noblest way, where man and woman, having lost
themselves in sex, desire to lose sex itself in
comradeship?&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret wondered, but said no word of
blame.&#160; This was Helen's evening.&#160; Troubles enough lay
ahead of her--the loss of friends and of social advantages, the
agony, the supreme agony, of motherhood, which is even yet not a
matter of common knowledge.&#160; For the present let the moon
shine brightly and the breezes of the spring blow gently, dying
away from the gale of the day, and let the earth, who brings
increase, bring peace.&#160; Not even to herself dare she blame
Helen.&#160; She could not assess her trespass by any moral code;
it was everything or nothing.&#160; Morality can tell us that
murder is worse than stealing, and group most sins in an order all
must approve, but it cannot group Helen.&#160; The surer its
pronouncements on this point, the surer may we be that morality is
not speaking.&#160; Christ was evasive when they questioned
Him.&#160; It is those that cannot connect who hasten to cast the
first stone.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This was Helen's evening--won at what cost,
and not to be marred by the sorrows of others.&#160; Of her own
tragedy Margaret never uttered a word.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"One isolates," said Helen slowly.&#160; "I
isolated Mr. Wilcox from the other forces that were pulling Leonard
downhill.&#160; Consequently, I was full of pity, and almost of
revenge.&#160; For weeks I had blamed Mr. Wilcox only, and so, when
your letters came--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I need never have written them," sighed
Margaret.&#160; "They never shielded Henry.&#160; How hopeless it
is to tidy away the past, even for others!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I did not know that it was your own idea
to dismiss the Basts."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Looking back, that was wrong of me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Looking back, darling, I know that it was
right.&#160; It is right to save the man whom one loves.&#160; I am
less enthusiastic about justice now.&#160; But we both thought you
wrote at his dictation.&#160; It seemed the last touch of his
callousness.&#160; Being very much wrought up by this time--and
Mrs. Bast was upstairs.&#160; I had not seen her, and had talked
for a long time to Leonard--I had snubbed him for no reason, and
that should have warned me I was in danger.&#160; So when the notes
came I wanted us to go to you for an explanation.&#160; He said
that he guessed the explanation--he knew of it, and you mustn't
know.&#160; I pressed him to tell me.&#160; He said no one must
know; it was something to do with his wife.&#160; Right up to the
end we were Mr. Bast and Miss Schlegel.&#160; I was going to tell
him that he must be frank with me when I saw his eyes, and guessed
that Mr. Wilcox had ruined him in two ways, not one.&#160; I drew
him to me.&#160; I made him tell me.&#160; I felt very lonely
myself.&#160; He is not to blame.&#160; He would have gone on
worshipping me.&#160; I want never to see him again, though it
sounds appalling.&#160; I wanted to give him money and feel
finished.&#160; Oh, Meg, the little that is known about these
things!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She laid her face against the tree.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The little, too, that is known about
growth!&#160; Both times it was loneliness, and the night, and
panic afterwards.&#160; Did Leonard grow out of Paul?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret did not speak for a moment.&#160;
So tired was she that her attention had actually wandered to the
teeth--the teeth that had been thrust into the tree's bark to
medicate it.&#160; From where she sat she could see them
gleam.&#160; She had been trying to count them.&#160; "Leonard is a
better growth than madness," she said.&#160; "I was afraid that you
would react against Paul until you went over the verge."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I did react until I found poor
Leonard.&#160; I am steady now.&#160; I shan't ever like your
Henry, dearest Meg, or even speak kindly about him, but all that
blinding hate is over.&#160; I shall never rave against Wilcoxes
any more.&#160; I understand how you married him, and you will now
be very happy."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret did not reply.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes," repeated Helen, her voice growing
more tender, "I do at last understand."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Except Mrs. Wilcox, dearest, no one
understands our little movements."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Because in death--I agree."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not quite.&#160; I feel that you and I and
Henry are only fragments of that woman's mind.&#160; She knows
everything.&#160; She is everything.&#160; She is the house, and
the tree that leans over it.&#160; People have their own deaths as
well as their own lives, and even if there is nothing beyond death,
we shall differ in our nothingness.&#160; I cannot believe that
knowledge such as hers will perish with knowledge such as
mine.&#160; She knew about realities.&#160; She knew when people
were in love, though she was not in the room.&#160; I don't doubt
that she knew when Henry deceived her."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Good-night, Mrs. Wilcox," called a
voice.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, good-night, Miss Avery."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why should Miss Avery work for us?" Helen
murmured.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why, indeed?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Miss Avery crossed the lawn and merged into
the hedge that divided it from the farm.&#160; An old gap, which
Mr. Wilcox had filled up, had reappeared, and her track through the
dew followed the path that he had turfed over, when he improved the
garden and made it possible for games.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"This is not quite our house yet," said
Helen.&#160; "When Miss Avery called, I felt we are only a couple
of tourists."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We shall be that everywhere, and for
ever."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But affectionate tourists--"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But tourists who pretend each hotel is
their home."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I can't pretend very long," said
Helen.&#160; "Sitting under this tree one forgets, but I know that
tomorrow I shall see the moon rise out of Germany.&#160; Not all
your goodness can alter the facts of the case.&#160; Unless you
will come with me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret thought for a moment.&#160; In the
past year she had grown so fond of England that to leave it was a
real grief.&#160; Yet what detained her?&#160; No doubt Henry would
pardon her outburst, and go on blustering and muddling into a ripe
old age.&#160; But what was the good?&#160; She had just as soon
vanish from his mind.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Are you serious in asking me, Helen?&#160;
Should I get on with your Monica?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You would not, but I am serious in asking
you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Still, no more plans now.&#160; And no
more reminiscences."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They were silent for a little.&#160; It was
Helen's evening.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The present flowed by them like a
stream.&#160; The tree rustled.&#160; It had made music before they
were born, and would continue after their deaths, but its song was
of the moment.&#160; The moment had passed.&#160; The tree rustled
again.&#160; Their senses were sharpened, and they seemed to
apprehend life.&#160; Life passed.&#160; The tree nestled
again.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Sleep now," said Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The peace of the country was entering into
her.&#160; It has no commerce with memory, and little with
hope.&#160; Least of all is it concerned with the hopes of the next
five minutes.&#160; It is the peace of the present, which passes
understanding.&#160; Its murmur came "now," and "now" once more as
they trod the gravel, and "now," as the moonlight fell upon their
father's sword.&#160; They passed upstairs, kissed, and amidst the
endless iterations fell asleep.&#160; The house had enshadowed the
tree at first, but as the moon rose higher the two disentangled,
and were clear for a few moments at midnight.&#160; Margaret awoke
and looked into the garden.&#160; How incomprehensible that Leonard
Bast should have won her this night of peace!&#160; Was he also
part of Mrs. Wilcox's mind?&#160;</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 41</h3>
<p>Far different was Leonard's development.&#160; The months after
Oniton, whatever minor troubles they might bring him, were all
overshadowed by Remorse.&#160; When Helen looked back she could
philosophize, or she could look into the future and plan for her
child.&#160; But the father saw nothing beyond his own sin.&#160;
Weeks afterwards, in the midst of other occupations, he would
suddenly cry out, "Brute--you brute, I couldn't have--" and be rent
into two people who held dialogues.&#160; Or brown rain would
descend, blotting out faces and the sky.&#160; Even Jacky noticed
the change in him.&#160; Most terrible were his sufferings when he
awoke from sleep.&#160; Sometimes he was happy at first, but grew
conscious of a burden hanging to him and weighing down his thoughts
when they would move.&#160; Or little irons scorched his
body.&#160; Or a sword stabbed him.&#160; He would sit at the edge
of his bed, holding his heart and moaning, "Oh what <em>shall</em>
I do, whatever <em>shall</em> I do?"&#160; Nothing brought
ease.&#160; He could put distance between him and the trespass, but
it grew in his soul.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Remorse is not among the eternal
verities.&#160; The Greeks were right to dethrone her.&#160; Her
action is too capricious, as though the Erinyes selected for
punishment only certain men and certain sins.&#160; And of all
means to regeneration Remorse is surely the most wasteful.&#160; It
cuts away healthy tissues with the poisoned.&#160; It is a knife
that probes far deeper than the evil.&#160; Leonard was driven
straight through its torments and emerged pure, but enfeebled--a
better man, who would never lose control of himself again, but also
a smaller, who had less to control.&#160; Nor did purity mean
peace.&#160; The use of the knife can become a habit as hard to
shake off as passion itself, and Leonard continued to start with a
cry out of dreams.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He built up a situation that was far enough
from the truth.&#160; It never occurred to him that Helen was to
blame.&#160; He forgot the intensity of their talk, the charm that
had been lent him by sincerity, the magic of Oniton under darkness
and of the whispering river.&#160; Helen loved the absolute.&#160;
Leonard had been ruined absolutely, and had appeared to her as a
man apart, isolated from the world.&#160; A real man, who cared for
adventure and beauty, who desired to live decently and pay his way,
who could have travelled more gloriously through life than the
Juggernaut car that was crushing him.&#160; Memories of Evie's
wedding had warped her, the starched servants, the yards of uneaten
food, the rustle of overdressed women, motor-cars oozing grease on
the gravel, rubbish on a pretentious band.&#160; She had tasted the
lees of this on her arrival: in the darkness, after failure, they
intoxicated her.&#160; She and the victim seemed alone in a world
of unreality, and she loved him absolutely, perhaps for half an
hour.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the morning she was gone.&#160; The note
that she left, tender and hysterical in tone, and intended to be
most kind, hurt her lover terribly.&#160; It was as if some work of
art had been broken by him, some picture in the National Gallery
slashed out of its frame.&#160; When he recalled her talents and
her social position, he felt that the first passerby had a right to
shoot him down.&#160; He was afraid of the waitress and the porters
at the railway-station.&#160; He was afraid at first of his wife,
though later he was to regard her with a strange new tenderness,
and to think, "There is nothing to choose between us, after
all."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The expedition to Shropshire crippled the
Basts permanently.&#160; Helen in her flight forgot to settle the
hotel bill, and took their return tickets away with her; they had
to pawn Jacky's bangles to get home, and the smash came a few days
afterwards.&#160; It is true that Helen offered him five thousands
pounds, but such a sum meant nothing to him.&#160; He could not see
that the girl was desperately righting herself, and trying to save
something out of the disaster, if it was only five thousand
pounds.&#160; But he had to live somehow.&#160; He turned to his
family, and degraded himself to a professional beggar.&#160; There
was nothing else for him to do.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"A letter from Leonard," thought Blanche,
his sister; "and after all this time." She hid it, so that her
husband should not see, and when he had gone to his work read it
with some emotion, and sent the prodigal a little money out of her
dress allowance.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"A letter from Leonard!" said the other
sister, Laura, a few days later.&#160; She showed it to her
husband.&#160; He wrote a cruel insolent reply, but sent more money
than Blanche, so Leonard soon wrote to him again.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And during the winter the system was
developed.&#160; Leonard realized that they need never starve,
because it would be too painful for his relatives.&#160; Society is
based on the family, and the clever wastrel can exploit this
indefinitely.&#160; Without a generous thought on either side,
pounds and pounds passed.&#160; The donors disliked Leonard, and he
grew to hate them intensely.&#160; When Laura censured his immoral
marriage, he thought bitterly, "She minds that!&#160; What would
she say if she knew the truth?"&#160; When Blanche's husband
offered him work, he found some pretext for avoiding it.&#160; He
had wanted work keenly at Oniton, but too much anxiety had
shattered him; he was joining the unemployable.&#160; When his
brother, the lay-reader, did not reply to a letter, he wrote again,
saying that he and Jacky would come down to his village on
foot.&#160; He did not intend this as blackmail.&#160; Still, the
brother sent a postal order, and it became part of the
system.&#160; And so passed his winter and his spring.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the horror there are two bright
spots.&#160; He never confused the past.&#160; He remained alive,
and blessed are those who live, if it is only to a sense of
sinfulness.&#160; The anodyne of muddledom, by which most men blur
and blend their mistakes, never passed Leonard's lips--</p>
<blockquote><em>And if I drink oblivion of a day,<br />
So shorten I the stature of my soul.</em></blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is a hard saying, and a hard man
wrote it, but it lies at the foot of all character.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And the other bright spot was his
tenderness for Jacky.&#160; He pitied her with nobility now--not
the contemptuous pity of a man who sticks to a woman through thick
and thin.&#160; He tried to be less irritable.&#160; He wondered
what her hungry eyes desired--nothing that she could express, or
that he or any man could give her.&#160; Would she ever receive the
justice that is mercy--the justice for by-products that the world
is too busy to bestow?&#160; She was fond of flowers, generous with
money, and not revengeful.&#160; If she had borne him a child he
might have cared for her.&#160; Unmarried, Leonard would never have
begged; he would have flickered out and died.&#160; But the whole
of life is mixed.&#160; He had to provide for Jacky, and went down
dirty paths that she might have a few feathers and dishes of food
that suited her.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One day he caught sight of Margaret and her
brother.&#160; He was in St.&#160; Paul's.&#160; He had entered the
cathedral partly to avoid the rain and partly to see a picture that
had educated him in former years.&#160; But the light was bad, the
picture ill placed, and Time and Judgment were inside him
now.&#160; Death alone still charmed him, with her lap of poppies,
on which all men shall sleep.&#160; He took one glance, and turned
aimlessly away towards a chair.&#160; Then down the nave he saw
Miss Schlegel and her brother.&#160; They stood in the fairway of
passengers, and their faces were extremely grave.&#160; He was
perfectly certain that they were in trouble about their
sister.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once outside--and he fled immediately--he
wished that he had spoken to them.&#160; What was his life?&#160;
What were a few angry words, or even imprisonment?&#160; He had
done wrong--that was the true terror.&#160; Whatever they might
know, he would tell them everything he knew.&#160; He re-entered
St. Paul's.&#160; But they had moved in his absence, and had gone
to lay their difficulties before Mr. Wilcox and Charles.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The sight of Margaret turned remorse into
new channels.&#160; He desired to confess, and though the desire is
proof of a weakened nature, which is about to lose the essence of
human intercourse, it did not take an ignoble form.&#160; He did
not suppose that confession would bring him happiness.&#160; It was
rather that he yearned to get clear of the tangle.&#160; So does
the suicide yearn.&#160; The impulses are akin, and the crime of
suicide lies rather in its disregard for the feelings of those whom
we leave behind.&#160; Confession need harm no one--it can satisfy
that test--and though it was un-English, and ignored by our
Anglican cathedral, Leonard had a right to decide upon it.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, he trusted Margaret.&#160; He
wanted her hardness now.&#160; That cold, intellectual nature of
hers would be just, if unkind.&#160; He would do whatever she told
him, even if he had to see Helen.&#160; That was the supreme
punishment she would exact.&#160; And perhaps she would tell him
how Helen was.&#160; That was the supreme reward.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He knew nothing about Margaret, not even
whether she was married to Mr. Wilcox, and tracking her out took
several days.&#160; That evening he toiled through the wet to
Wickham Place, where the new flats were now appearing.&#160; Was he
also the cause of their move?&#160; Were they expelled from society
on his account?&#160; Thence to a public library, but could find no
satisfactory Schlegel in the directory.&#160; On the morrow he
searched again.&#160; He hung about outside Mr. Wilcox's office at
lunch time, and, as the clerks came out said: "Excuse me, sir, but
is your boss married?"&#160; Most of them stared, some said,
"What's that to you?" but one, who had not yet acquired reticence,
told him what he wished.&#160; Leonard could not learn the private
address.&#160; That necessitated more trouble with directories and
tubes.&#160; Ducie Street was not discovered till the Monday, the
day that Margaret and her husband went down on their hunting
expedition to Howards End.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He called at about four o'clock.&#160; The
weather had changed, and the sun shone gaily on the ornamental
steps--black and white marble in triangles.&#160; Leonard lowered
his eyes to them after ringing the bell.&#160; He felt in curious
health: doors seemed to be opening and shutting inside his body,
and he had been obliged to steep sitting up in bed, with his back
propped against the wall.&#160; When the parlourmaid came he could
not see her face; the brown rain had descended suddenly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Does Mrs. Wilcox live here?" he
asked.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She's out," was the answer.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"When will she be back?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'll ask," said the parlourmaid.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret had given instructions that no one
who mentioned her name should ever be rebuffed.&#160; Putting the
door on the chain--for Leonard's appearance demanded this--she went
through to the smoking-room, which was occupied by Tibby.&#160;
Tibby was asleep.&#160; He had had a good lunch.&#160; Charles
Wilcox had not yet rung him up for the distracting interview.&#160;
He said drowsily: "I don't know.&#160; Hilton.&#160; Howards
End.&#160; Who is it?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'll ask, sir."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, don't bother."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"They have taken the car to Howards End,"
said the parlourmaid to Leonard.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He thanked her, and asked whereabouts that
place was.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You appear to want to know a good deal,"
she remarked.&#160; But Margaret had forbidden her to be
mysterious.&#160; She told him against her better judgment that
Howards End was in Hertfordshire.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Is it a village, please?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Village!&#160; It's Mr. Wilcox's private
house--at least, it's one of them.&#160; Mrs. Wilcox keeps her
furniture there.&#160; Hilton is the village."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes.&#160; And when will they be
back?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Mr. Schlegel doesn't know.&#160; We can't
know everything, can we?"&#160; She shut him out, and went to
attend to the telephone, which was ringing furiously.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He loitered away another night of
agony.&#160; Confession grew more difficult.&#160; As soon as
possible he went to bed.&#160; He watched a patch of moonlight
cross the floor of their lodging, and, as sometimes happens when
the mind is overtaxed, he fell asleep for the rest of the room, but
kept awake for the patch of moonlight.&#160; Horrible!&#160; Then
began one of those disintegrating dialogues.&#160; Part of him
said: "Why horrible?&#160; It's ordinary light from the room." "But
it moves." "So does the moon." "But it is a clenched fist." "Why
not?" "But it is going to touch me." "Let it." And, seeming to
gather motion, the patch ran up his blanket.&#160; Presently a blue
snake appeared; then another, parallel to it.&#160; "Is there life
in the moon?" "Of course." "But I thought it was uninhabited." "Not
by Time, Death, Judgment, and the smaller snakes." "Smaller
snakes!" said Leonard indignantly and aloud.&#160; "What a
notion!"&#160; By a rending effort of the will he woke the rest of
the room up.&#160; Jacky, the bed, their food, their clothes on the
chair, gradually entered his consciousness, and the horror vanished
outwards, like a ring that is spreading through water.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I say, Jacky, I'm going out for a
bit."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She was breathing regularly.&#160; The
patch of light fell clear of the striped blanket, and began to
cover the shawl that lay over her feet.&#160; Why had he been
afraid?&#160; He went to the window, and saw that the moon was
descending through a clear sky.&#160; He saw her volcanoes, and the
bright expanses that a gracious error has named seas.&#160; They
paled, for the sun, who had lit them up, was coming to light the
earth.&#160; Sea of Serenity, Sea of Tranquillity, Ocean of the
Lunar Storms, merged into one lucent drop, itself to slip into the
sempiternal dawn.&#160; And he had been afraid of the
moon!&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He dressed among the contending lights, and
went through his money.&#160; It was running low again, but enough
for a return ticket to Hilton.&#160; As it clinked Jacky opened her
eyes.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Hullo, Len!&#160; What ho, Len!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What ho, Jacky!&#160; see you again
later."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She turned over and slept.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The house was unlocked, their landlord
being a salesman at Convent Garden.&#160; Leonard passed out and
made his way down to the station.&#160; The train, though it did
not start for an hour, was already drawn up at the end of the
platform, and he lay down in it and slept.&#160; With the first
jolt he was in daylight; they had left the gateways of King's
Cross, and were under blue sky.&#160; Tunnels followed, and after
each the sky grew bluer, and from the embankment at Finsbury Park
he had his first sight of the sun.&#160; It rolled along behind the
eastern smokes--a wheel, whose fellow was the descending moon--and
as yet it seemed the servant of the blue sky, not its lord.&#160;
He dozed again.&#160; Over Tewin Water it was day.&#160; To the
left fell the shadow of the embankment and its arches; to the right
Leonard saw up into the Tewin Woods and towards the church, with
its wild legend of immortality.&#160; Six forest trees--that is a
fact--grow out of one of the graves in Tewin churchyard.&#160; The
grave's occupant--that is the legend--is an atheist, who declared
that if God existed, six forest trees would grow out of her
grave.&#160; These things in Hertfordshire; and farther afield lay
the house of a hermit--Mrs. Wilcox had known him--who barred
himself up, and wrote prophecies, and gave all he had to the
poor.&#160; While, powdered in between, were the villas of business
men, who saw life more steadily, though with the steadiness of the
half-closed eye.&#160; Over all the sun was streaming, to all the
birds were singing, to all the primroses were yellow, and the
speedwell blue, and the country, however they interpreted her, was
uttering her cry of "now."&#160; She did not free Leonard yet, and
the knife plunged deeper into his heart as the train drew up at
Hilton.&#160; But remorse had become beautiful.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hilton was asleep, or at the earliest,
breakfasting.&#160; Leonard noticed the contrast when he stepped
out of it into the country.&#160; Here men had been up since
dawn.&#160; Their hours were ruled, not by a London office, but by
the movements of the crops and the sun.&#160; That they were men of
the finest type only the sentimentalist can declare.&#160; But they
kept to the life of daylight.&#160; They are England's hope.&#160;
Clumsily they carry forward the torch of the sun, until such time
as the nation sees fit to take it up.&#160; Half clodhopper, half
board-school prig, they can still throw back to a nobler stock, and
breed yeomen.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the chalk pit a motor passed him.&#160;
In it was another type, whom Nature favours--the Imperial.&#160;
Healthy, ever in motion, it hopes to inherit the earth.&#160; It
breeds as quickly as the yeoman, and as soundly; strong is the
temptation to acclaim it as a super-yeoman, who carries his
country's virtue overseas.&#160; But the Imperialist is not what he
thinks or seems.&#160; He is a destroyer.&#160; He prepares the way
for cosmopolitanism, and though his ambitions may be fulfilled, the
earth that he inherits will be grey.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To Leonard, intent on his private sin,
there came the conviction of innate goodness elsewhere.&#160; It
was not the optimism which he had been taught at school.&#160;
Again and again must the drums tap, and the goblins stalk over the
universe before joy can be purged of the superficial.&#160; It was
rather paradoxical, and arose from his sorrow.&#160; Death destroys
a man, but the idea of death saves him--that is the best account of
it that has yet been given.&#160; Squalor and tragedy can beckon to
all that is great in us, and strengthen the wings of love.&#160;
They can beckon; it is not certain that they will, for they are not
love's servants.&#160; But they can beckon, and the knowledge of
this incredible truth comforted him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As he approached the house all thought
stopped.&#160; Contradictory notions stood side by side in his
mind.&#160; He was terrified but happy, ashamed, but had done no
sin.&#160; He knew the confession: "Mrs. Wilcox, I have done
wrong," but sunrise had robbed its meaning, and he felt rather on a
supreme adventure.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He entered a garden, steadied himself
against a motor-car that he found in it, found a door open and
entered a house.&#160; Yes, it would be very easy.&#160; From a
room to the left he heard voices, Margaret's amongst them.&#160;
His own name was called aloud, and a man whom he had never seen
said, "Oh, is he there?&#160; I am not surprised.&#160; I now
thrash him within an inch of his life."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Mrs. Wilcox," said Leonard, "I have done
wrong."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The man took him by the collar and cried,
"Bring me a stick." Women were screaming.&#160; A stick, very
bright, descended.&#160; It hurt him, not where it descended, but
in the heart.&#160; Books fell over him in a shower.&#160; Nothing
had sense.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Get some water," commanded Charles, who
had all through kept very calm.&#160; "He's shamming.&#160; Of
course I only used the blade.&#160; Here, carry him out into the
air."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thinking that he understood these things,
Margaret obeyed him.&#160; They laid Leonard, who was dead, on the
gravel; Helen poured water over him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's enough," said Charles.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, murder's enough," said Miss Avery,
coming out of the house with the sword.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 42</h3>
<p>When Charles left Ducie Street he had caught the first train
home, but had no inkling of the newest development until late at
night.&#160; Then his father, who had dined alone, sent for him,
and in very grave tones inquired for Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't know where she is, pater," said
Charles.&#160; "Dolly kept back dinner nearly an hour for
her."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Tell me when she comes in--."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another hour passed.&#160; The servants
went to bed, and Charles visited his father again, to receive
further instructions.&#160; Mrs. Wilcox had still not
returned.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'll sit up for her as late as you like,
but she can hardly be coming.&#160; Isn't she stopping with her
sister at the hotel?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Perhaps," said Mr. Wilcox
thoughtfully--"perhaps."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Can I do anything for you, sir?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not tonight, my boy."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Wilcox liked being called sir.&#160; He
raised his eyes and gave his son more open a look of tenderness
than he usually ventured.&#160; He saw Charles as little boy and
strong man in one.&#160; Though his wife had proved unstable his
children were left to him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After midnight he tapped on Charles's
door.&#160; "I can't sleep," he said.&#160; "I had better have a
talk with you and get it over."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He complained of the heat.&#160; Charles
took him out into the garden, and they paced up and down in their
dressing-gowns.&#160; Charles became very quiet as the story
unrolled; he had known all along that Margaret was as bad as her
sister.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She will feel differently in the morning,"
said Mr. Wilcox, who had of course said nothing about Mrs.
Bast.&#160; "But I cannot let this kind of thing continue without
comment.&#160; I am morally certain that she is with her sister at
Howards End.&#160; The house is mine--and, Charles, it will be
yours--and when I say that no one is to live there, I mean that no
one is to live there.&#160; I won't have it." He looked angrily at
the moon.&#160; "To my mind this question is connected with
something far greater, the rights of property itself."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Undoubtedly," said Charles.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Wilcox linked his arm in his son's, but
somehow liked him less as he told him more.&#160; "I don't want you
to conclude that my wife and I had anything of the nature of a
quarrel.&#160; She was only over-wrought, as who would not
be?&#160; I shall do what I can for Helen, but on the understanding
that they clear out of the house at once.&#160; Do you see?&#160;
That is a sine qua non."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then at eight tomorrow I may go up in the
car?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Eight or earlier.&#160; Say that you are
acting as my representative, and, of course, use no violence,
Charles."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the morrow, as Charles returned, leaving
Leonard dead upon the gravel, it did not seem to him that he had
used violence.&#160; Death was due to heart disease.&#160; His
stepmother herself had said so, and even Miss Avery had
acknowledged that he only used the flat of the sword.&#160; On his
way through the village he informed the police, who thanked him,
and said there must be an inquest.&#160; He found his father in the
garden shading his eyes from the sun.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It has been pretty horrible," said Charles
gravely.&#160; "They were there, and they had the man up there with
them too."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What--what man?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I told you last night.&#160; His name was
Bast."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"My God, is it possible?" said Mr.
Wilcox.&#160; "In your mother's house!&#160; Charles, in your
mother's house!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I know, pater.&#160; That was what I
felt.&#160; As a matter of fact, there is no need to trouble about
the man.&#160; He was in the last stages of heart disease, and just
before I could show him what I thought of him he went off.&#160;
The police are seeing about it at this moment."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Wilcox listened attentively.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I got up there--oh, it couldn't have been
more than half-past seven.&#160; The Avery woman was lighting a
fire for them.&#160; They were still upstairs.&#160; I waited in
the drawing-room.&#160; We were all moderately civil and collected,
though I had my suspicions.&#160; I gave them your message, and
Mrs. Wilcox said, 'Oh yes, I see; yes,' in that way of hers."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Nothing else?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I promised to tell you, 'with her love,'
that she was going to Germany with her sister this evening.&#160;
That was all we had time for."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Wilcox seemed relieved.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Because by then I suppose the man got
tired of hiding, for suddenly Mrs. Wilcox screamed out his
name.&#160; I recognized it, and I went for him in the hall.&#160;
Was I right, pater?&#160; I thought things were going a little too
far."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Right, my dear boy?&#160; I don't
know.&#160; But you would have been no son of mine if you
hadn't.&#160; Then did he just--just--crumple up as you
said?"&#160; He shrunk from the simple word.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He caught hold of the bookcase, which came
down over him.&#160; So I merely put the sword down and carried him
into the garden.&#160; We all thought he was shamming.&#160;
However, he's dead right enough.&#160; Awful business!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Sword?" cried his father, with anxiety in
his voice.&#160; "What sword?&#160; Whose sword?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"A sword of theirs."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What were you doing with it?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, didn't you see, pater, I had to
snatch up the first thing handy I hadn't a riding-whip or
stick.&#160; I caught him once or twice over the shoulders with the
flat of their old German sword."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then what?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He pulled over the bookcase, as I said,
and fell," said Charles, with a sigh.&#160; It was no fun doing
errands for his father, who was never quite satisfied.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But the real cause was heart
disease?&#160; Of that you're sure?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That or a fit.&#160; However, we shall
hear more than enough at the inquest on such unsavoury
topics."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They went into breakfast.&#160; Charles had
a racking headache, consequent on motoring before food.&#160; He
was also anxious about the future, reflecting that the police must
detain Helen and Margaret for the inquest and ferret the whole
thing out.&#160; He saw himself obliged to leave Hilton.&#160; One
could not afford to live near the scene of a scandal--it was not
fair on one's wife.&#160; His comfort was that the pater's eyes
were opened at last.&#160; There would be a horrible smash up, and
probably a separation from Margaret; then they would all start
again, more as they had been in his mother's time.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I think I'll go round to the
police-station," said his father when breakfast was over.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What for?" cried Dolly, who had still not
been "told."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Very well, sir.&#160; Which car will you
have?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I think I'll walk."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's a good half-mile," said Charles,
stepping into the garden.&#160; "The sun's very hot for
April.&#160; Shan't I take you up, and then, perhaps, a little spin
round by Tewin?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You go on as if I didn't know my own
mind," said Mr. Wilcox fretfully.&#160; Charles hardened his
mouth.&#160; "You young fellows' one idea is to get into a
motor.&#160; I tell you, I want to walk: I'm very fond of
walking."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, all right; I'm about the house if you
want me for anything.&#160; I thought of not going up to the office
today, if that is your wish."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It is, indeed, my boy," said Mr. Wilcox,
and laid a hand on his sleeve.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles did not like it; he was uneasy
about his father, who did not seem himself this morning.&#160;
There was a petulant touch about him--more like a woman.&#160;
Could it be that he was growing old?&#160; The Wilcoxes were not
lacking in affection; they had it royally, but they did not know
how to use it.&#160; It was the talent in the napkin, and, for a
warm-hearted man, Charles had conveyed very little joy.&#160; As he
watched his father shuffling up the road, he had a vague regret--a
wish that something had been different somewhere--a wish (though he
did not express it thus) that he had been taught to say "I" in his
youth.&#160; He meant to make up for Margaret's defection, but knew
that his father had been very happy with her until yesterday.&#160;
How had she done it?&#160; By some dishonest trick, no doubt--but
how?&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Wilcox reappeared at eleven, looking
very tired.&#160; There was to be an inquest on Leonard's' body
tomorrow, and the police required his son to attend.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I expected that," said Charles.&#160; "I
shall naturally be the most important witness there."</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 43</h3>
<p>Out of the turmoil and horror that had begun with Aunt Juley's
illness and was not even to end with Leonard's death, it seemed
impossible to Margaret that healthy life should re-emerge.&#160;
Events succeeded in a logical, yet senseless, train.&#160; People
lost their humanity, and took values as arbitrary as those in a
pack of playing-cards.&#160; It was natural that Henry should do
this and cause Helen to do that, and then think her wrong for doing
it; natural that she herself should think him wrong; natural that
Leonard should want to know how Helen was, and come, and Charles be
angry with him for coming--natural, but unreal.&#160; In this
jangle of causes and effects what had become of their true
selves?&#160; Here Leonard lay dead in the garden, from natural
causes; yet life was a deep, deep river, death a blue sky, life was
a house, death a wisp of hay, a flower, a tower, life and death
were anything and everything, except this ordered insanity, where
the king takes the queen, and the ace the king.&#160; Ah, no; there
was beauty and adventure behind, such as the man at her feet had
yearned for; there was hope this side of the grave; there were
truer relationships beyond the limits that fetter us now.&#160; As
a prisoner looks up and sees stars beckoning, so she, from the
turmoil and horror of those days, caught glimpses of the diviner
wheels.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And Helen, dumb with fright, but trying to
keep calm for the child's sake, and Miss Avery, calm, but murmuring
tenderly, "No one ever told the lad he'll have a child"--they also
reminded her that horror is not the end.&#160; To what ultimate
harmony we tend she did not know, but there seemed great chance
that a child would be born into the world, to take the great
chances of beauty and adventure that the world offers.&#160; She
moved through the sunlit garden, gathering narcissi, crimson-eyed
and white.&#160; There was nothing else to be done; the time for
telegrams and anger was over, and it seemed wisest that the hands
of Leonard should be folded on his breast and be filled with
flowers.&#160; Here was the father; leave it at that.&#160; Let
Squalor be turned into Tragedy, whose eyes are the stars, and whose
hands hold the sunset and the dawn.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And even the influx of officials, even the
return of the doctor, vulgar and acute, could not shake her belief
in the eternity of beauty.&#160; Science explained people, but
could not understand them.&#160; After long centuries among the
bones and muscles it might be advancing to knowledge of the nerves,
but this would never give understanding.&#160; One could open the
heart to Mr. Mansbridge and his sort without discovering its
secrets to them, for they wanted everything down in black and
white, and black and white was exactly what they were left
with.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They questioned her closely about
Charles.&#160; She never suspected why.&#160; Death had come, and
the doctor agreed that it was due to heart disease.&#160; They
asked to see her father's sword.&#160; She explained that Charles's
anger was natural, but mistaken.&#160; Miserable questions about
Leonard followed, all of which she answered unfalteringly.&#160;
Then back to Charles again.&#160; "No doubt Mr. Wilcox may have
induced death," she said; "but if it wasn't one thing it would have
been another, as you yourselves know." At last they thanked her,
and took the sword and the body down to Hilton.&#160; She began to
pick up the books from the floor.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen had gone to the farm.&#160; It was
the best place for her, since she had to wait for the
inquest.&#160; Though, as if things were not hard enough, Madge and
her husband had raised trouble; they did not see why they should
receive the offscourings of Howards End.&#160; And, of course, they
were right.&#160; The whole world was going to be right, and amply
avenge any brave talk against the conventions.&#160; "Nothing
matters," the Schlegels had said in the past, "except one's
self-respect and that of one's friends." When the time came, other
things mattered terribly.&#160; However, Madge had yielded, and
Helen was assured of peace for one day and night, and tomorrow she
would return to Germany.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for herself, she determined to go
too.&#160; No message came from Henry; perhaps he expected her to
apologize.&#160; Now that she had time to think over her own
tragedy, she was unrepentant.&#160; She neither forgave him for his
behaviour nor wished to forgive him.&#160; Her speech to him seemed
perfect.&#160; She would not have altered a word.&#160; It had to
be uttered once in a life, to adjust the lopsidedness of the
world.&#160; It was spoken not only to her husband, but to
thousands of men like him--a protest against the inner darkness in
high places that comes with a commercial age.&#160; Though he would
build up his life without hers, she could not apologize.&#160; He
had refused to connect, on the clearest issue that can be laid
before a man, and their love must take the consequences.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No, there was nothing more to be
done.&#160; They had tried not to go over the precipice but perhaps
the fall was inevitable.&#160; And it comforted her to think that
the future was certainly inevitable: cause and effect would go
jangling forward to some goal doubtless, but to none that she could
imagine.&#160; At such moments the soul retires within, to float
upon the bosom of a deeper stream, and has communion with the dead,
and sees the world's glory not diminished, but different in kind to
what she has supposed.&#160; She alters her focus until trivial
things are blurred.&#160; Margaret had been tending this way all
the winter.&#160; Leonard's death brought her to the goal.&#160;
Alas!&#160; that Henry should fade, away as reality emerged, and
only her love for him should remain clear, stamped with his image
like the cameos we rescue out of dreams.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With unfaltering eye she traced his
future.&#160; He would soon present a healthy mind to the world
again, and what did he or the world care if he was rotten at the
core?&#160; He would grow into a rich, jolly old man, at times a
little sentimental about women, but emptying his glass with
anyone.&#160; Tenacious of power, he would keep Charles and the
rest dependent, and retire from business reluctantly and at an
advanced age.&#160; He would settle down--though she could not
realize this.&#160; In her eyes Henry was always moving and causing
others to move, until the ends of the earth met.&#160; But in time
he must get too tired to move, and settle down.&#160; What
next?&#160; The inevitable word.&#160; The release of the soul to
its appropriate Heaven.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Would they meet in it?&#160; Margaret
believed in immortality for herself.&#160; An eternal future had
always seemed natural to her.&#160; And Henry believed in it for
himself.&#160; Yet, would they meet again?&#160; Are there not
rather endless levels beyond the grave, as the theory that he had
censured teaches?&#160; And his level, whether higher or lower,
could it possibly be the same as hers?&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thus gravely meditating, she was summoned
by him.&#160; He sent up Crane in the motor.&#160; Other servants
passed like water, but the chauffeur remained, though impertinent
and disloyal.&#160; Margaret disliked Crane, and he knew it.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Is it the keys that Mr. Wilcox wants?" she
asked.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He didn't say, madam."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You haven't any note for me?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He didn't say, madam."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After a moment's thought she locked up
Howards End.&#160; It was pitiable to see in it the stirrings of
warmth that would be quenched for ever.&#160; She raked out the
fire that was blazing in the kitchen, and spread the coals in the
gravelled yard.&#160; She closed the windows and drew the
curtains.&#160; Henry would probably sell the place now.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She was determined not to spare him, for
nothing new had happened as far as they were concerned.&#160; Her
mood might never have altered from yesterday evening.&#160; He was
standing a little outside Charles's gate, and motioned the car to
stop.&#160; When his wife got out he said hoarsely: "I prefer to
discuss things with you outside."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It will be more appropriate in the road, I
am afraid," said Margaret.&#160; "Did you get my message?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What about?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I am going to Germany with my
sister.&#160; I must tell you now that I shall make it my permanent
home.&#160; Our talk last night was more important than you have
realized.&#160; I am unable to forgive you and am leaving
you."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I am extremely tired," said Henry, in
injured tones.&#160; "I have been walking about all the morning,
and wish to sit down."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Certainly, if you will consent to sit on
the grass."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Great North Road should have been
bordered all its length with glebe.&#160; Henry's kind had filched
most of it.&#160; She moved to the scrap opposite, wherein were the
Six Hills.&#160; They sat down on the farther side, so that they
could not be seen by Charles or Dolly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Here are your keys," said Margaret.&#160;
She tossed them towards him.&#160; They fell on the sunlit slope of
grass, and he did not pick them up.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I have something to tell you," he said
gently.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She knew this superficial gentleness, this
confession of hastiness, that was only intended to enhance her
admiration of the male.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I don't want to hear it," she
replied.&#160; "My sister is going to be ill.&#160; My life is
going to be with her now.&#160; We must manage to build up
something, she and I and her child."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Where are you going?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Munich.&#160; We start after the inquest,
if she is not too ill."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"After the inquest?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Have you realized what the verdict at the
inquest will be?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, heart disease."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, my dear; manslaughter."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret drove her fingers through the
grass.&#160; The hill beneath her moved as if it was alive.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Manslaughter," repeated Mr. Wilcox.&#160;
"Charles may go to prison.&#160; I dare not tell him.&#160; I don't
know what to do--what to do.&#160; I'm broken--I'm
ended.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No sudden warmth arose in her.&#160; She
did not see that to break him was her only hope.&#160; She did not
enfold the sufferer in her arms.&#160; But all through that day and
the next a new life began to move.&#160; The verdict was brought
in.&#160; Charles was committed for trial.&#160; It was against all
reason that he should be punished, but the law, being made in his
image, sentenced him to three years' imprisonment.&#160; Then
Henry's fortress gave way.&#160; He could bear no one but his wife,
he shambled up to Margaret afterwards and asked her to do what she
could with him.&#160; She did what seemed easiest--she took him
down to recruit at Howards End.</p>
<h3 align="center">Chapter 44</h3>
<p>Tom's father was cutting the big meadow.&#160; He passed again
and again amid whirring blades and sweet odours of grass,
encompassing with narrowing circles the sacred centre of the
field.&#160; Tom was negotiating with Helen.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I haven't any idea," she replied.&#160;
"Do you suppose baby may, Meg?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret put down her work and regarded
them absently.&#160; "What was that?" she asked.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Tom wants to know whether baby is old
enough to play with hay?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I haven't the least notion," answered
Margaret, and took up her work again.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Now, Tom, baby is not to stand; he is not
to lie on his face; he is not to lie so that his head wags; he is
not to be teased or tickled; and he is not to be cut into two or
more pieces by the cutter.&#160; Will you be as careful as all
that?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tom held out his arms.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That child is a wonderful nursemaid,"
remarked Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He is fond of baby.&#160; That's why he
does it!" was Helen's answer.&#160; They're going to be lifelong
friends."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Starting at the ages of six and
one?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Of course.&#160; It will be a great thing
for Tom."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It may be a greater thing for baby."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fourteen months had passed, but Margaret
still stopped at Howards End.&#160; No better plan had occurred to
her.&#160; The meadow was being recut, the great red poppies were
reopening in the garden.&#160; July would follow with the little
red poppies among the wheat, August with the cutting of the
wheat.&#160; These little events would become part of her year
after year.&#160; Every summer she would fear lest the well should
give out, every winter lest the pipes should freeze; every westerly
gale might blow the wych-elm down and bring the end of all things,
and so she could not read or talk during a westerly gale.&#160; The
air was tranquil now.&#160; She and her sister were sitting on the
remains of Evie's mockery, where the lawn merged into the
field.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What a time they all are!" said
Helen.&#160; "What can they be doing inside?"&#160; Margaret, who
was growing less talkative, made no answer.&#160; The noise of the
cutter came intermittently, like the breaking of waves.&#160; Close
by them a man was preparing to scythe out one of the
dell-holes.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I wish Henry was out to enjoy this," said
Helen.&#160; "This lovely weather and to be shut up in the
house!&#160; It's very hard."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It has to be," said Margaret.&#160; "The
hay-fever is his chief objection against living here, but he thinks
it worth while."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Meg, is or isn't he ill?&#160; I can't
make out."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not ill.&#160; Eternally tired.&#160; He
has worked very hard all his life, and noticed nothing.&#160; Those
are the people who collapse when they do notice a thing."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I suppose he worries dreadfully about his
part of the tangle."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Dreadfully.&#160; That is why I wish Dolly
had not come, too, today.&#160; Still, he wanted them all to
come.&#160; It has to be."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why does he want them?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret did not answer.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Meg, may I tell you something?&#160; I
like Henry."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You'd be odd if you didn't," said
Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I usen't to."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Usen't!"&#160; She lowered her eyes a
moment to the black abyss of the past.&#160; They had crossed it,
always excepting Leonard and Charles.&#160; They were building up a
new life, obscure, yet gilded with tranquillity.&#160; Leonard was
dead; Charles had two years more in prison.&#160; One usen't always
to see clearly before that time.&#160; It was different now.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I like Henry because he does worry."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And he likes you because you don't."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen sighed.&#160; She seemed humiliated,
and buried her face in her hands.&#160; After a time she said:
"Above love," a transition less abrupt than it appeared.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret never stopped working.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I mean a woman's love for a man.&#160; I
supposed I should hang my life on to that once, and was driven up
and down and about as if something was worrying through me.&#160;
But everything is peaceful now; I seem cured.&#160; That Herr
F&#246;rstmeister, whom Frieda keeps writing about, must be a noble
character, but he doesn't see that I shall never marry him or
anyone.&#160; It isn't shame or mistrust of myself.&#160; I simply
couldn't.&#160; I'm ended.&#160; I used to be so dreamy about a
man's love as a girl, and think that for good or evil love must be
the great thing.&#160; But it hasn't been; it has been itself a
dream.&#160; Do you agree?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I do not agree.&#160; I do not."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I ought to remember Leonard as my lover,"
said Helen, stepping down into the field.&#160; "I tempted him, and
killed him and it is surely the least I can do.&#160; I would like
to throw out all my heart to Leonard on such an afternoon as
this.&#160; But I cannot.&#160; It is no good pretending.&#160; I
am forgetting him." Her eyes filled with tears.&#160; "How nothing
seems to match--how, my darling, my precious--" She broke
off.&#160; "Tommy!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, please?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Baby's not to try and stand.--There's
something wanting in me.&#160; I see you loving Henry, and
understanding him better daily, and I know that death wouldn't part
you in the least.&#160; But I--Is it some awful appalling, criminal
defect?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret silenced her.&#160; She said: "It
is only that people are far more different than is pretended.&#160;
All over the world men and women are worrying because they cannot
develop as they are supposed to develop.&#160; Here and there they
have the matter out, and it comforts them.&#160; Don't fret
yourself, Helen.&#160; Develop what you have; love your
child.&#160; I do not love children.&#160; I am thankful to have
none.&#160; I can play with their beauty and charm, but that is
all--nothing real, not one scrap of what there ought to be.&#160;
And others--others go farther still, and move outside humanity
altogether.&#160; A place, as well as a person, may catch the
glow.&#160; Don't you see that all this leads to comfort in the
end?&#160; It is part of the battle against sameness.&#160;
Differences--eternal differences, planted by God in a single
family, so that there may always be colour; sorrow perhaps, but
colour in the daily grey.&#160; Then I can't have you worrying
about Leonard.&#160; Don't drag in the personal when it will not
come.&#160; Forget him."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, yes, but what has Leonard got out of
life?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Perhaps an adventure."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Is that enough?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not for us.&#160; But for him."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen took up a bunch of grass.&#160; She
looked at the sorrel, and the red and white and yellow clover, and
the quaker grass, and the daisies, and the bents that composed
it.&#160; She raised it to her face.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Is it sweetening yet?" asked
Margaret.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, only withered."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It will sweeten tomorrow."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen smiled.&#160; "Oh, Meg, you are a
person," she said.&#160; "Think of the racket and torture this time
last year.&#160; But now I couldn't stop unhappy if I tried.&#160;
What a change--and all through you!"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, we merely settled down.&#160; You and
Henry learnt to understand one another and to forgive, all through
the autumn and the winter."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, but who settled us down?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret did not reply.&#160; The scything
had begun, and she took off her pince-nez to watch it.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You!" cried Helen.&#160; "You did it all,
sweetest, though you're too stupid to see.&#160; Living here was
your plan--I wanted you; he wanted you; and every one said it was
impossible, but you knew.&#160; Just think of our lives without
you, Meg--I and baby with Monica, revolting by theory, he handed
about from Dolly to Evie.&#160; But you picked up the pieces, and
made us a home.&#160; Can't it strike you--even for a moment--that
your life has been heroic?&#160; Can't you remember the two months
after Charles's arrest, when you began to act, and did all?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You were both ill at the time," said
Margaret.&#160; "I did the obvious things.&#160; I had two invalids
to nurse.&#160; Here was a house, ready furnished and empty.&#160;
It was obvious.&#160; I didn't know myself it would turn into a
permanent home.&#160; No doubt I have done a little towards
straightening the tangle, but things that I can't phrase have
helped me."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I hope it will be permanent," said Helen,
drifting away to other thoughts.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I think so.&#160; There are moments when I
feel Howards End peculiarly our own."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"All the same, London's creeping."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She pointed over the meadow--over eight or
nine meadows, but at the end of them was a red rust.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You see that in Surrey and even Hampshire
now," she continued.&#160; "I can see it from the Purbeck
Downs.&#160; And London is only part of something else, I'm
afraid.&#160; Life's going to be melted down, all over the
world."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret knew that her sister spoke
truly.&#160; Howards End, Oniton, the Purbeck Downs, the Oderberge,
were all survivals, and the melting-pot was being prepared for
them.&#160; Logically, they had no right to be alive.&#160; One's
hope was in the weakness of logic.&#160; Were they possibly the
earth beating time?&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Because a thing is going strong now, it
need not go strong for ever," she said.&#160; "This craze for
motion has only set in during the last hundred years.&#160; It may
be followed by a civilization that won't be a movement, because it
will rest on the earth.&#160; All the signs are against it now, but
I can't help hoping, and very early in the morning in the garden I
feel that our house is the future as well as the past."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They turned and looked at it.&#160; Their
own memories coloured it now, for Helen's child had been born in
the central room of the nine.&#160; Then Margaret said, "Oh, take
care--!" for something moved behind the window of the hall, and the
door opened.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The conclave's breaking at last.&#160;
I'll go."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was Paul.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen retreated with the children far into
the field.&#160; Friendly voices greeted her.&#160; Margaret rose,
to encounter a man with a heavy black moustache.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"My father has asked for you," he said with
hostility.&#160; She took her work and followed him.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We have been talking business," he
continued, "but I dare say you knew all about it beforehand."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Yes, I did."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Clumsy of movement--for he had spent all
his life in the saddle--Paul drove his foot against the paint of
the front door.&#160; Mrs. Wilcox gave a little cry of
annoyance.&#160; She did not like anything scratched; she stopped
in the hall to take Dolly's boa and gloves out of a vase.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Her husband was lying in a great leather
chair in the dining-room, and by his side, holding his hand rather
ostentatiously, was Evie.&#160; Dolly, dressed in purple, sat near
the window.&#160; The room was a little dark and airless; they were
obliged to keep it like this until the carting of the hay.&#160;
Margaret joined the family without speaking; the five of them had
met already at tea, and she knew quite well what was going to be
said.&#160; Averse to wasting her time, she went on sewing.&#160;
The clock struck six.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Is this going to suit every one?" said
Henry in a weary voice.&#160; He used the old phrases, but their
effect was unexpected and shadowy.&#160; "Because I don't want you
all coming here later on and complaining that I have been
unfair."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's apparently got to suit us," said
Paul.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I beg your pardon, my boy.&#160; You have
only to speak, and I will leave the house to you instead."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Paul frowned ill-temperedly, and began
scratching at his arm.&#160; "As I've given up the outdoor life
that suited me, and I have come home to look after the business,
it's no good my settling down here," he said at last.&#160; "It's
not really the country, and it's not the town."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Very well.&#160; Does my arrangement suit
you, Evie?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Of course, Father."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And you, Dolly?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dolly raised her faded little face, which
sorrow could wither but not steady.&#160; "Perfectly splendidly,"
she said.&#160; "I thought Charles wanted it for the boys, but last
time I saw him he said no, because we cannot possibly live in this
part of England again.&#160; Charles says we ought to change our
name, but I cannot think what to, for Wilcox just suits Charles and
me, and I can't think of any other name."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There was a general silence.&#160; Dolly
looked nervously round, fearing that she had been
inappropriate.&#160; Paul continued to scratch his arm.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then I leave Howards End to my wife
absolutely," said Henry.&#160; "And let every one understand that;
and after I am dead let there be no jealousy and no
surprise."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret did not answer.&#160; There was
something uncanny in her triumph.&#160; She, who had never expected
to conquer anyone, had charged straight through these Wilcoxes and
broken up their lives.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In consequence, I leave my wife no money,"
said Henry.&#160; "That is her own wish.&#160; All that she would
have had will be divided among you.&#160; I am also giving you a
great deal in my lifetime, so that you may be independent of
me.&#160; That is her wish, too.&#160; She also is giving away a
great deal of money.&#160; She intends to diminish her income by
half during the next ten years; she intends when she dies to leave
the house to her--to her nephew, down in the field.&#160; Is all
that clear?&#160; Does every one understand?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Paul rose to his feet.&#160; He was
accustomed to natives, and a very little shook him out of the
Englishman.&#160; Feeling manly and cynical, he said: "Down in the
field?&#160; Oh, come!&#160; I think we might have had the whole
establishment, piccaninnies included."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Cahill whispered: "Don't, Paul.&#160;
You promised you'd take care." Feeling a woman of the world, she
rose and prepared to take her leave.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Her father kissed her.&#160; "Good-bye, old
girl," he said; "don't you worry about me.&#160;"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Good-bye, Dad."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then it was Dolly's turn.&#160; Anxious to
contribute, she laughed nervously, and said: "Good-bye, Mr.
Wilcox.&#160; It does seem curious that Mrs. Wilcox should have
left Margaret Howards End, and yet she get it, after all."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From Evie came a sharply-drawn
breath.&#160; "Good-bye," she said to Margaret, and kissed
her.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And again and again fell the word, like the
ebb of a dying sea.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Good-bye."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Good-bye, Dolly."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So long, Father."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Good-bye, my boy; always take care of
yourself."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Good-bye, Mrs. Wilcox."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Good-bye.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret saw their visitors to the
gate.&#160; Then she returned to her husband and laid her head in
his hands.&#160; He was pitiably tired.&#160; But Dolly's remark
had interested her.&#160; At last she said: "Could you tell me,
Henry, what was that about Mrs. Wilcox having left me Howards
End?"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tranquilly he replied: "Yes, she did.&#160;
But that is a very old story.&#160; When she was ill and you were
so kind to her she wanted to make you some return, and, not being
herself at the time, scribbled 'Howards End' on a piece of
paper.&#160; I went into it thoroughly, and, as it was clearly
fanciful, I set it aside, little knowing what my Margaret would be
to me in the future."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Margaret was silent.&#160; Something shook
her life in its inmost recesses, and she shivered.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I didn't do wrong, did I?" he asked,
bending down.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You didn't, darling.&#160; Nothing has
been done wrong."<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From the garden came laughter.&#160; "Here
they are at last!" exclaimed Henry, disengaging himself with a
smile.&#160; Helen rushed into the gloom, holding Tom by one hand
and carrying her baby on the other.&#160; There were shouts of
infectious joy.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The field's cut!"&#160; Helen cried
excitedly--"the big meadow!&#160; We've seen to the very end, and
it'll be such a crop of hay as never!"</p>
