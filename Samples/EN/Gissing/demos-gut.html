    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Stanbury Hill, remote but two hours&rsquo; walk from a region blasted with mine
      and factory and furnace, shelters with its western slope a fair green
      valley, a land of meadows and orchard, untouched by poisonous breath. At
      its foot lies the village of Wanley. The opposite side of the hollow is
      clad with native wood, skirting for more than a mile the bank of a shallow
      stream, a tributary of the Severn. Wanley consists in the main of one long
      street; the houses are stone-built, with mullioned windows, here and there
      showing a picturesque gable or a quaint old chimney. The oldest buildings
      are four cottages which stand at the end of the street; once upon a time
      they formed the country residence of the abbots of Belwick. The abbey of
      that name still claims for its ruined self a portion of earth&rsquo;s surface;
      but, as it had the misfortune to be erected above the thickest coal-seam
      in England, its walls are blackened with the fume of collieries and shaken
      by the strain of mighty engines. Climb Stanbury Hill at nightfall, and,
      looking eastward, you behold far off a dusky ruddiness in the sky, like
      the last of an angry sunset; with a glass you can catch glimpses of little
      tongues of flame, leaping and quivering on the horizon. That is Belwick.
      The good abbots, who were wont to come out in the summer time to Wanley,
      would be at a loss to recognise their consecrated home in those sooty
      relics. Belwick, with its hundred and fifty fire-vomiting blast-furnaces,
      would to their eyes more nearly resemble a certain igneous realm of which
      they thought much in their sojourn upon earth, and which, we may assure
      ourselves, they dream not of in the quietness of their last long sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large house, which stands aloof from the village and a little above it,
      is Wanley Manor. The county history tells us that Wanley was given in the
      fifteenth century to that same religious foundation, and that at the
      dissolution of monasteries the Manor passed into the hands of Queen
      Catherine. The house is half-timbered; from the height above it looks old
      and peaceful amid its immemorial trees. Towards the end of the eighteenth
      century it became the home of a family named Eldon, the estate including
      the greater part of the valley below. But an Eldon who came into
      possession when William IV. was King brought the fortunes of his house to
      a low ebb, and his son, seeking to improve matters by abandoning his
      prejudices and entering upon commercial speculation, in the end left a
      widow and two boys with little more to live upon than the income which
      arose from Mrs. Eldon&rsquo;s settlements. The Manor was shortly after this
      purchased by a Mr. Mutimer, a Belwick ironmaster; but Mrs. Eldon and her
      boys still inhabited the house, in consequence of certain events which
      will shortly be narrated. Wanley would have mourned their departure; they
      were the aristocracy of the neighbourhood, and to have them ousted by a
      name which no one knew, a name connected only with blast-furnaces, would
      have made a distinct fall in the tone of Wanley society. Fortunately no
      changes were made in the structure by its new owner. Not far from it you
      see the church and the vicarage, these also unmolested in their quiet age.
      Wanley, it is to be feared, lags far behind the times&mdash;painfully so,
      when one knows for a certainty that the valley upon which it looks
      conceals treasures of coal, of ironstone&mdash;blackband, to be technical&mdash;and
      of fireclay. Some ten years ago it seemed as if better things were in
      store; there was a chance that the vale might for ever cast off its
      foolish greenery, and begin vomiting smoke and flames in humble imitation
      of its metropolis beyond the hills. There are men in Belwick who have an
      angry feeling whenever Wanley is mentioned to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the inhabitants of the Manor, the most respected of those who dwelt
      in Wanley were the Walthams. At the time of which I speak, this family
      consisted of a middle-aged lady; her son, of one-and-twenty; and her
      daughter, just eighteen. They had resided here for little more than two
      years, but a gentility which marked their speech and demeanour, and the
      fact that they were well acquainted with the Eldons, from the first caused
      them to be looked up to. It was conjectured, and soon confirmed by Mrs.
      Waltham&rsquo;s own admissions, that they had known a larger way of living than
      that to which they adapted themselves in the little house on the side of
      Stanbury Hill, whence they looked over the village street. Mr. Waltham
      had, in fact, been a junior partner in a Belwick firm, which came to
      grief. He saved enough out of the wreck to: make a modest competency for
      his family, and would doubtless in time have retrieved his fortune, but
      death was beforehand with him. His wife, in the second year of her
      widowhood, came with her daughter Adela to Wanley; her son Alfred had gone
      to commercial work in Belwick. Mrs. Waltham was a prudent woman, and
      tenacious of ideas which recommended themselves to her practical
      instincts; such an idea had much to do with her settlement in the remote
      village, which she would not have chosen for her abode out of love of its
      old-world quietness. But at the Manor was Hubert Eldon. Hubert was four
      years older than Adela. He had no fortune of his own, but it was tolerably
      certain that some day he would be enormously rich, and there was small
      likelihood that he would marry till that expected change in his position
      came about.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the afternoon of a certain Good Friday, Mrs. Waltham sat at her open
      window, enjoying the air and busy with many thoughts, among other things
      wondering who was likely to drop in for a cup of tea. It was a late
      Easter, and warm spring weather had already clothed the valley with
      greenness; to-day the sun was almost hot, and the west wind brought many a
      sweet odour from gardens near and far. From her sitting-room Mrs. Waltham
      had the best view to be obtained from any house in Wanley; she looked, as
      I have said, right over the village street, and on either hand the valley
      spread before her a charming prospect. Opposite was the wooded slope,
      freshening now with exquisite shades of new-born leafage; looking north,
      she saw fruit-gardens, making tender harmonies; southwards spread verdure
      and tillage. Yet something there was which disturbed the otherwise perfect
      unity of the scene, an unaccustomed trouble to the eye. In the very midst
      of the vale, perhaps a quarter of a mile to the south of the village, one
      saw what looked like the beginning of some engineering enterprise&mdash;a
      great throwing-up of earth, and the commencement of a roadway on which
      metal rails were laid. What was being done? The work seemed too extensive
      for a mere scheme of drainage. Whatever the undertaking might be, it was
      now at a standstill, seeing that old Mr. Mutimer, the owner of the land,
      had been in his grave just three days, and no one as yet could say whether
      his heir would or would not pursue this novel project. Mrs. Waltham
      herself felt that the view was spoilt, though her appreciation of nature
      was not of the keenest, and she would never have thought of objecting to a
      scheme which would produce money at the cost of the merely beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I scarcely think Hubert will continue it,&rsquo; she was musing to herself. &lsquo;He
      has enough without that, and his tastes don&rsquo;t lie in that direction.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had on her lap a local paper, at which she glanced every now and then;
      but her state of mind was evidently restless. The road on either side of
      which stood the houses of the village led on to the Manor, and in that
      direction Mrs. Waltham gazed frequently. The church clock chimed half-past
      four, and shortly after a rosy-cheeked young girl came at a quick step up
      the gravelled pathway which made the approach to the Walthams&rsquo; cottage.
      She saw Mrs. Waltham at the window, and, when she was near, spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Adela at home?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Letty; she&rsquo;s gone for a walk with her brother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry!&rsquo; said the girl, whose voice was as sweet as her face was
      pretty. &lsquo;We wanted her to come for croquet. Yet I was half afraid to come
      and ask her whilst Mr. Alfred was at home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, and at the same time blushed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should you be afraid of Alfred?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Waltham graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned it off and spoke quickly of another subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did you like Mr. Wyvern this morning?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a new vicar, who had been in Wanley but a couple of days, and had
      this morning officiated for the first time at the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a voice he has!&rsquo; was the lady&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he? And such a hairy man! They say he&rsquo;s very learned; but his
      sermon was very simple&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you think so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I liked it. Only he pronounces certain words strangely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, has Mr. Eldon come yet?&rsquo; was the young lady&rsquo;s next question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He hadn&rsquo;t arrived this morning. Isn&rsquo;t it extraordinary? He must be out of
      England.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But surely Mrs. Eldon knows his address, and he can&rsquo;t be so very far
      away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she looked down the pathway by which she had come, and of a
      sudden her face exhibited alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Mrs. Waltham!&rsquo; she whispered hurriedly. &lsquo;If Mr. Wyvern isn&rsquo;t coming
      to see you! I&rsquo;m afraid to meet him. Do let me pop in and hide till I can
      get away without being seen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The front door stood ajar, and the girl at once ran into the house. Mrs.
      Waltham came into the passage laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I go to the top of the stairs?&rsquo; asked the other nervously. &lsquo;You know
      how absurdly shy I am. No, I&rsquo;ll run out into the garden behind; then I can
      steal round as soon as he comes in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She escaped, and in a minute or two the new vicar presented himself at the
      door. A little maid might well have some apprehension in facing him, for
      Mr. Wyvern was of vast proportions and leonine in aspect. With the
      exception of one ungloved hand and the scant proportions of his face which
      were not hidden by hair, he was wholly black in hue; an enormous beard,
      the colour of jet, concealed the linen about his throat, and a veritable
      mane, dark as night, fell upon his shoulders. His features were not
      ill-matched with this sable garniture; their expression was a fixed
      severity; his eye regarded you with stern scrutiny, and passed from the
      examination to a melancholy reflectiveness. Yet his appearance was
      suggestive of anything but ill-nature; contradictory though it may seem,
      the face was a pleasant one, inviting to confidence, to respect; if he
      could only have smiled, the tender humanity which lurked in the lines of
      his countenance would have become evident. His age was probably a little
      short of fifty.
    </p>
    <p>
      A servant replied to his knock, and, after falling back in a momentary
      alarm, introduced him to the sitting-room. He took Mrs. Waltham&rsquo;s hand
      silently, fixed upon her the full orbs of his dark eyes, and then, whilst
      still retaining her fingers, looked thoughtfully about the room. It was a
      pleasant little parlour, with many an evidence of refinement in those who
      occupied it. Mr. Wyvern showed something like a look of satisfaction. He
      seated himself, and the chair creaked ominously beneath him. Then he again
      scrutinised Mrs. Waltham.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a lady of fair complexion, with a double chin. Her dress suggested
      elegant tastes, and her hand was as smooth and delicate as a lady&rsquo;s should
      be. A long gold chain descended from her neck to the watch-pocket at her
      waist, and her fingers exhibited several rings. She bore the reverend
      gentleman&rsquo;s scrutiny with modest grace, almost as if it flattered her. And
      indeed there was nothing whatever of ill-breeding in Mr. Wyvern&rsquo;s mode of
      instituting acquaintance with his parishioner; one felt that he was a man
      of pronounced originality, and that he might be trusted in his variance
      from the wonted modes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The view from the windows gave him a subject for his first remarks. Mrs.
      Waltham had been in some fear of a question which would go to the roots of
      her soul&rsquo;s history; it would have been in keeping with his visage. But,
      with native acuteness, she soon discovered that Mr. Wyvern&rsquo;s gaze had very
      little to do with the immediate subject of his thought, or, what was much
      the same thing, that he seldom gave the whole of his attention to the
      matter outwardly calling for it. He was a man of profound mental absences;
      he could make replies, even put queries, and all the while be brooding
      intensely upon a wholly different subject. Mrs. Waltham did not altogether
      relish it; she was in the habit of being heard with deference; but, to be
      sure, a clergyman only talked of worldly things by way of concession. It
      certainly seemed so in this clergyman&rsquo;s case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your prospect,&rsquo; Mr. Wyvern remarked presently, &lsquo;will not be improved by
      the works below.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice was very deep, and all his words were weighed in the utterance.
      This deliberation at times led to peculiarities of emphasis in single
      words. Probably he was a man of philological crotchets; he said, for
      instance, &lsquo;pro-spect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I scarcely think Mr. Eldon will go on with the mining,&rsquo; replied Mrs.
      Waltham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! you think not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am quite sure he said that unconsciously,&rsquo; the lady remarked to
      herself. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s thinking of some quite different affair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Eldon,&rsquo; the clergyman resumed, fixing upon her an absent eye, &lsquo;is Mr.
      Mutimer&rsquo;s son-in-law, I understand?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His brother, Mr. Godfrey Eldon, was.&rsquo; Mrs. Waltham corrected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! the one that died?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He said it questioningly; then added&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have a difficulty in mastering details of this kind. You would do me a
      great kindness in explaining to me briefly of whom the family at the Manor
      at present consists?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham was delighted to talk on such a subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only of Mrs. Eldon and her son, Mr. Hubert Eldon. The elder son, Godfrey,
      was lost in a shipwreck, on a voyage to New Zealand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was a sailor?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no!&rsquo; said the lady, with a smile. &lsquo;He was in business at Belwick. It
      was shortly after his marriage with Miss Mutimer that he took the voyage&mdash;partly
      for his health, partly to examine some property his father had had an
      interest in. Old Mr. Eldon engaged in speculations&mdash;I believe it was
      flax-growing. The results, unfortunately, were anything but satisfactory.
      It was that which led to his son entering business&mdash;quite a new thing
      in their family. Wasn&rsquo;t it very sad? Poor Godfrey and his young wife both
      drowned! The marriage was, as you may imagine, not altogether a welcome
      one to Mrs. Eldon; Mr. Mutimer was quite a self-made man, quite. I
      understand he has relations in London of the very poorest class&mdash;labouring
      people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They probably benefit by his will?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say. In any case, to a very small extent. It has for a long time
      been understood that Hubert Eldon inherits.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Singular!&rsquo; murmured the clergyman, still in the same absent way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it not? He took so to the young fellows; no doubt he was flattered to
      be allied to them. And then he was passionately devoted to his daughter;
      if only for her sake, he would have done his utmost for the family.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I understand that Mr. Mutimer purchased the Manor from them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was before the marriage. Godfrey Eldon sold it; he had his father&rsquo;s
      taste for speculation, I fancy, and wanted capital. Then Mr. Mutimer
      begged them to remain in the house. He certainly was a wonderfully kind
      old&mdash;old gentleman; his behaviour to Mrs. Eldon was always the
      perfection of courtesy. A stranger would find it difficult to understand
      how she could get on so well with him, but their sorrows brought them
      together, and Mr. Mutimer&rsquo;s generosity was really noble. If I had not
      known his origin, I should certainly have taken him for a county
      gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yet he proposed to mine in the valley,&rsquo; observed Mr. Wyvern, half to
      himself, casting a glance at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham did not at first see the connection between this and what she
      had been saying. Then it occurred to her that Mr. Wyvern was aristocratic
      in his views.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;one expects to find a little of the original&mdash;of
      the money-making spirit. Of course such a thing would never have suggested
      itself to the Eldons. And in fact very little of the lands remained to
      them. Mr. Mutimer bought a great deal from other people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Wyvern sat brooding, Mrs. Waltham asked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have seen Mrs. Eldon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not yet. She is too unwell to receive visits.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, poor thing, she is a great invalid. I thought, perhaps, you&mdash;.
      But I know she likes to be very quiet. What a strange thing about Mr.
      Eldon, is it not? You know that he has never come yet; not even to the
      funeral.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Singular!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An inexplicable thing! There has never been a shadow of disagreement
      between them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Eldon is abroad, I believe?&rsquo; said the clergyman musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Abroad? Oh dear, no! At least, I&mdash;. Is there news of his being
      abroad?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvern merely shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As far as we know,&rsquo; Mrs. Waltham continued, rather disturbed by the
      suggestion, &lsquo;he is at Oxford.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A student?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. He is quite a youth&mdash;only two-and-twenty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a knock at the door, and a maid-servant entered to ask if she
      should lay the table for tea. Mrs. Waltham assented; then, to her visitor&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will do us the pleasure of drinking a cup of tea, Mr. Wyvern? we make
      a meal of it, in the country way. My boy and girl are sure to be in
      directly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like to make their acquaintance,&rsquo; was the grave response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alfred, my son,&rsquo; the lady proceeded, &lsquo;is with us for his Easter holiday.
      Belwick is so short a distance away, and yet too far to allow of his
      living here, unfortunately.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His age?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just one-and-twenty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The same age as my own boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you have a son?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A youngster, studying music in Germany. I have just been spending a
      fortnight with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How delightful! If only poor Alfred could have pursued some more&mdash;more
      liberal occupation! Unhappily, we had small choice. Friends were good
      enough to offer him exceptional advantages not long after his father&rsquo;s
      death, and I was only too glad to accept the opening. I believe he is a
      clever boy; only such a dreadful Radical.&rsquo; She laughed, with a deprecatory
      motion of the hands. &lsquo;Poor Adela and he are at daggers drawn; no doubt it
      is some terrible argument that detains them now on the road. I can&rsquo;t think
      how he got his views; certainly his father never inculcated them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The air, Mrs. Waltham, the air,&rsquo; murmured the clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady was not quite sure that she understood the remark, but the
      necessity of reply was obviated by the entrance of the young man in
      question. Alfred was somewhat undergrown, but of solid build. He walked in
      a sturdy and rather aggressive way, and his plump face seemed to indicate
      an intelligence, bright, indeed, but of the less refined order. His head
      was held stiffly, and his whole bearing betrayed a desire to make the most
      of his defective stature. His shake of the hand was an abrupt downward
      jerk, like a pull at a bell-rope. In the smile with which he met Mr.
      Wyvern a supercilious frame of mind was not altogether concealed; he
      seemed anxious to have it understood that in <i>him</i> the clerical
      attire inspired nothing whatever of superstitious reverence. Reverence, in
      truth, was not Mr. Waltham&rsquo;s failing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvern, as his habit was at introductions, spoke no words, but held
      the youth&rsquo;s hand for a few moments and looked him in the eyes. Alfred
      turned his head aside uneasily, and was a trifle ruddy in the cheeks when
      at length he regained his liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By-the-by,&rsquo; he remarked to his mother when he had seated himself, with
      crossed legs, &lsquo;Eldon has turned up at last. He passed us in a cab, or so
      Adela said. I didn&rsquo;t catch a glimpse of the individual.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really!&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Waltham. &lsquo;He was coming from Agworth station?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose so. There was a trunk on the four-wheeler. Adela says he looked
      ill, though I don&rsquo;t see how she discovered so much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no doubt she is right. He must have been ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvern, in contrast with his habit, was paying marked attention; he
      leaned forward, with a hand on each knee. In the meanwhile the
      preparations for tea had progressed, and as Mrs. Waltham rose at the sight
      of the teapot being brought in, her daughter entered the room. Adela was
      taller by half a head than her brother; she was slim and graceful. The air
      had made her face bloom, and the smile which was added as she drew near to
      the vicar enhanced the charm of a countenance at all times charming. She
      was not less than ladylike in self-possession, but Mr. Wyvern&rsquo;s towering
      sableness clearly awed her a little. For an instant her eyes drooped, but
      at once she raised them and met the severe gaze with unflinching orbs.
      Releasing her hand, Mr. Wyvern performed a singular little ceremony: he
      laid his right palm very gently on her nutbrown hair, and his lips moved.
      At the same time he all but smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred&rsquo;s face was a delightful study the while; it said so clearly,
      &lsquo;Confound the parson&rsquo;s impudence!&rsquo; Mrs. Waltham, on the other hand, looked
      pleased as she rustled to her place at the tea-tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So Mr. Eldon has come?&rsquo; she said, glancing at Adela. &lsquo;Alfred says he
      looks ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; interposed the young man, &lsquo;pray be accurate. I distinctly stated
      that I did not even see him, and should not have known that it was he at
      all. Adela is responsible for that assertion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I just saw his face,&rsquo; the girl said naturally. &lsquo;I thought he looked ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvern addressed to her a question about her walk, and for a few
      minutes they conversed together. There was a fresh simplicity in Adela&rsquo;s
      way of speaking which harmonised well with her appearance and with the
      scene in which she moved. A gentle English girl, this dainty home, set in
      so fair and peaceful a corner of the world, was just the abode one would
      have chosen for her. Her beauty seemed a part of the burgeoning
      spring-time, She was not lavish of her smiles; a timid seriousness marked
      her manner to the clergyman, and she replied to his deliberately-posed
      questions with a gravity respectful alike of herself and of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of Mr. Wyvern stood a large cake, of which a portion was already
      sliced. The vicar, at Adela&rsquo;s invitation, accepted a piece of the cake;
      having eaten this, he accepted another; then yet another. His absence had
      come back upon him, and he talked he continued to eat portions of the
      cake, till but a small fraction of the original structure remained on the
      dish. Alfred, keenly observant of what was going on, pursed his lips from
      time to time and looked at his mother with exaggerated gravity, leading
      her eyes to the vanishing cake. Even Adela could not but remark the
      reverend gentleman&rsquo;s abnormal appetite, but she steadily discouraged her
      brother&rsquo;s attempts to draw her into the joke. At length it came to pass
      that Mr. Wyvern himself, stretching his hand mechanically to the dish,
      became aware that he had exhibited his appreciation of the sweet food in a
      degree not altogether sanctioned by usage. He fixed his eyes on the
      tablecloth, and was silent for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the vicar had taken his departure Alfred threw himself into a
      chair, thrust out his legs, and exploded in laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By Jove!&rsquo; he shouted. &lsquo;If that man doesn&rsquo;t experience symptoms of
      disorder! Why, I should be prostrate for a week if I consumed a quarter of
      what he has put out of sight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alfred, you are shockingly rude,&rsquo; reproved his mother, though herself
      laughing. &lsquo;Mr. Wyvern is absorbed in thought.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, he has taken the best means, I should say, to remind himself of
      actualities,&rsquo; rejoined the youth. &lsquo;But what a man he is! How did he behave
      in church this morning?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You should have come to see,&rsquo; said Mrs. Waltham, mildly censuring her
      son&rsquo;s disregard of the means of grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I like Mr. Wyvern,&rsquo; observed Adela, who was standing at the window
      looking out upon the dusking valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you would like any man in parsonical livery,&rsquo; scoffed her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred shortly betook himself to the garden, where, in spite of a decided
      freshness in the atmosphere, he walked for half-an-hour smoking a pipe.
      When he entered the house again, he met Adela at the foot of the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Mewling has just come in,&rsquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll come up with you,&rsquo; was the reply. &lsquo;Heaven defend me from
      her small talk!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They ascended to a very little room, which made a kind of boudoir for
      Adela. Alfred struck a match and lit a lamp, disclosing a nest of
      wonderful purity and neatness. On the table a drawing-board was slanted;
      it showed a text of Scripture in process of &lsquo;illumination.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Still at that kind of thing!&rsquo; exclaimed Alfred. &lsquo;My good child, if you
      want to paint, why don&rsquo;t you paint in earnest? Really, Adela, I must enter
      a protest! Remember that you are eighteen years of age.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t forget it, Alfred.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At eight-and-twenty, at eight-and-thirty, you propose still to be at the
      same stage of development?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll talk of it,&rsquo; said the girl quietly. &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t
      understand each other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course not, but we might, if only you&rsquo;d read sensible books that I
      could give you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela shook her head. The philosophical youth sank into his favourite
      attitude&mdash;legs extended, hands in pockets, nose in air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So, I suppose,&rsquo; he said presently, &lsquo;that fellow really has been ill?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela was sitting in thought; she looked up with a shadow of annoyance on
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That fellow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eldon, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to ask you a question,&rsquo; said his sister, interlocking her fingers
      and pressing them against her throat. &lsquo;Why do you always speak in a
      contemptuous way of Mr. Eldon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know I don&rsquo;t like the individual.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What cause has &ldquo;the individual&rdquo; given you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a snob.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that I know what that means,&rsquo; replied Adela, after thinking
      for a moment with downcast eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because you never read anything. He&rsquo;s a fellow who raises a great edifice
      of pretence on rotten foundations.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What can you mean? Mr. Eldon is a gentleman. What pretence is he guilty
      of?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentleman!&rsquo; uttered her brother with much scorn. &lsquo;Upon my word, that <i>is</i>
      the vulgarest of denominations! Who doesn&rsquo;t call himself so nowadays! A
      man&rsquo;s a man, I take it, and what need is there to lengthen the name? Thank
      the powers, we don&rsquo;t live in feudal ages. Besides, he doesn&rsquo;t seem to me
      to be what you imply.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela had taken a book; in turning over the pages, she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt you mean, Alfred, that, for some reason, you are determined to
      view him with prejudice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The reason is obvious enough. The fellow&rsquo;s behaviour is detestable; he
      looks at you from head to foot as if you were applying for a place in his
      stable. Whenever I want an example of a contemptible aristocrat, there&rsquo;s
      Eldon ready-made. Contemptible, because he&rsquo;s such a sham; as if everybody
      didn&rsquo;t know his history and his circumstances!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everybody doesn&rsquo;t regard them as you do. There is nothing whatever
      dishonourable in his position.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not in sponging on a rich old plebeian, a man he despises, and living in
      idleness at his expense?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Mr. Eldon does anything of the kind. Since his brother&rsquo;s
      death he has had a sufficient income of his own, so mother says.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sufficient income of his own! Bah! Five or six hundred a year; likely he
      lives on that! Besides, haven&rsquo;t they soaped old Mutimer into leaving them
      all his property? The whole affair is the best illustration one could
      possibly have of what aristocrats are brought to in a democratic age.
      First of all, Godfrey Eldon marries Mutimer&rsquo;s daughter; you are at liberty
      to believe, if you like, that he would have married her just the same if
      she hadn&rsquo;t had a penny. The old fellow is flattered. They see the hold
      they have, and stick to him like leeches. All for want of money, of
      course. Our aristocrats begin to see that they can&rsquo;t get on without money
      nowadays; they can&rsquo;t live on family records, and they find that people
      won&rsquo;t toady to them in the old way just on account of their name. Why, it
      began with Eldon&rsquo;s father&mdash;didn&rsquo;t he put his pride in his pocket, and
      try to make cash by speculation? Now I can respect him: he at all events
      faced the facts of the case honestly. The despicable thing in this Hubert
      Eldon is that, having got money once more, and in the dirtiest way, he
      puts on the top-sawyer just as if there was nothing to be ashamed of. If
      he and his mother were living in a small way on their few hundreds a year,
      he might haw-haw as much as he liked, and I should only laugh at him; he&rsquo;d
      be a fool, but an honest one. But catch them doing that! Family pride&rsquo;s
      too insubstantial a thing, you see. Well, as I said, they illustrate the
      natural course of things, the transition from the old age to the new. If
      Eldon has sons, they&rsquo;ll go in for commerce, and make themselves, if they
      can, millionaires; but by that time they&rsquo;ll dispense with airs and
      insolence&mdash;see if they don&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela kept her eyes on the pages before her, but she was listening
      intently. A sort of verisimilitude in the picture drawn by her
      Radical-minded brother could not escape her; her thought was troubled.
      When she spoke it was without resentment, but gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like this spirit in judging of people. You know quite well,
      Alfred, how easy it is to see the whole story in quite another way. You
      begin by a harsh and worldly judgment, and it leads you to misrepresent
      all that follows. I refuse to believe that Godfrey Eldon married Mrs.
      Mutimer&rsquo;s daughter for her money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course you do, sister Adela! Women won&rsquo;t admit such things; that&rsquo;s <i>their</i>
      aristocratic feeling!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that is, too, worthless and a sham? Will that, too, be done away with
      in the new age?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, depend upon it! When women are educated, they will take the world as
      it is, and decline to live on illusions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then how glad I am to have been left without education!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime a conversation of a very lively kind was in progress
      between Mrs. Waltham and her visitor, Mrs. Mewling. The latter was a lady
      whose position much resembled Mrs. Waltham&rsquo;s: she inhabited a small house
      in the village street, and spent most of her time in going about to hear
      or to tell some new thing. She came in this evening with a look presageful
      of news indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been to Belwick to-day,&rsquo; she began, sitting very close to Mrs.
      Waltham, whose lap she kept touching as she spoke with excited fluency.
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen Mrs. Yottle. My dear, what do you think she has told me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Yottle was the wife of a legal gentleman who had been in Mr.
      Mutimer&rsquo;s confidence. Mrs. Waltham at once divined intelligence affecting
      the Eldons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; she asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;d never dream such a thing! what <i>will</i> come to pass! An
      unthought-of possibility!&rsquo; She went on <i>crescendo</i>. &lsquo;My dear Mrs.
      Waltham, Mr. Mutimer has left no will!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as if an electric shock had passed from the tips of her fingers
      into her hearer&rsquo;s frame. Mrs. Waltham paled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That cannot be true!&rsquo; she whispered, incapable of utterance above breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, but there&rsquo;s not a doubt of it!&rsquo; Knowing that the news would be
      particularly unpalatable to Mrs. Waltham, she proceeded to dwell upon it
      with dancing eyes. &lsquo;Search has been going on since the day of the death:
      not a corner that hasn&rsquo;t been rummaged, not a drawer that hasn&rsquo;t been
      turned out, not a book in the library that hasn&rsquo;t been shaken, not a wall
      that hasn&rsquo;t been examined for secret doors! Mr. Mutimer has died
      intestate!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The other lady was mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And shall I tell you how it came about? Two days before his death, he had
      his will from Mr. Yottle, saying he wanted to make change&mdash;probably
      to execute a new will altogether. My dear, he destroyed it, and death
      surprised him before he could make another.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He wished to make changes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; Mrs. Mewling drew out the exclamation, shaking her raised finger,
      pursing her lips. &lsquo;And of that, too, I can tell you the reason. Mr.
      Mutimer was anything but pleased with young Eldon. That young man, let me
      tell you, has been conducting himself&mdash;oh, shockingly! Now you
      wouldn&rsquo;t dream of repeating this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems that news came not so very long ago of a certain actress,
      singer,&mdash;something of the kind, you understand? Friends thought it
      their duty&mdash;rightly, of course,&mdash;to inform Mr. Mutimer. I can&rsquo;t
      say exactly who did it; but we know that Hubert Eldon is not regarded
      affectionately by a good many people. My dear, he has been out of England
      for more than a month, living&mdash;oh, such extravagance! And the moral
      question, too? You know&mdash;those women! Someone, they say, of European
      reputation; of course no names are breathed. For my part, I can&rsquo;t say I am
      surprised. Young men, you know; and particularly young men of that kind!
      Well, it has cost him a pretty penny; he&rsquo;ll remember it as long as he
      lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then the property will go&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, to the working people in London; the roughest of the rough, they
      say! What <i>will</i> happen? It will be impossible for us to live here if
      they come and settle at the Manor. The neighbourhood will be intolerable.
      Think of the rag-tag-and-bobtail they will bring with them!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But Hubert!&rsquo; ejaculated Mrs. Waltham, whom this vision of barbaric onset
      affected little in the crashing together of a great airy castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, my dear, after all he still has more to depend upon than many we
      could instance. Probably he will take to the law,&mdash;that is, if he
      ever returns to England.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is at the Manor,&rsquo; said Mrs. Waltham, with none of the pleasure it
      would ordinarily have given her to be first with an item of news. &lsquo;He came
      this afternoon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He did! Who has seen him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alfred and Adela passed him on the road. He was in a cab.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feel for his poor mother. What a meeting it will be! But then we must
      remember that they had no actual claim on the inheritance. Of course it
      will be a most grievous disappointment, but what is life made of? I&rsquo;m
      afraid some people will be anything but grieved. We must confess that
      Hubert has not been exactly popular; and I rather wonder at it; I&rsquo;m sure
      he might have been if he had liked. Just a little too&mdash;too
      self-conscious, don&rsquo;t you think? Of course it was quite a mistake, but
      people had an idea that he presumed on wealth which was not his own. Well,
      well, we quiet folk look on, don&rsquo;t we? It&rsquo;s rather like a play.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Mrs. Mewling leaned forward yet more confidentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, you won&rsquo;t be offended? You don&rsquo;t mind a question? There wasn&rsquo;t
      anything definite?&mdash;Adela, I mean.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing, nothing whatever!&rsquo; Mrs. Waltham asserted with vigour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; Mrs. Mewling sighed deeply. &lsquo;How relieved I am! I did so fear!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing whatever,&rsquo; the other lady repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank goodness! Then there is no need to breathe a word of those shocking
      matters. But they do get abroad so!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A reflection Mrs. Mewling was justified in making.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The cab which had passed Adela and her brother at a short distance from
      Wanley brought faces to the windows or door of almost every house as it
      rolled through the village street. The direction in which it was going,
      the trunk on the roof, the certainty that it had come from Agworth
      station, suggested to everyone that young Eldon sat within. The occupant
      had, however, put up both windows just before entering the village, and
      sight of him was not obtained. Wanley had abundant matter for gossip that
      evening. Hubert&rsquo;s return, giving a keener edge to the mystery of his so
      long delay, would alone have sufficed to wagging tongues; hut, in
      addition, Mrs. Mewling was on the warpath, and the intelligence she spread
      was of a kind to run like wildfire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The approach to the Manor was a carriage-road, obliquely ascending the
      bill from a point some quarter of a mile beyond the cottages which once
      housed Belwick&rsquo;s abbots. Of the house scarcely a glimpse could be caught
      till you were well within the gates, so thickly was it embosomed in trees.
      This afternoon it wore a cheerless face; most of the blinds were still
      down, and the dwelling might have been unoccupied, for any sign of human
      activity that the eye could catch. There was no porch at the main
      entrance, and the heavy nail-studded door greeted a visitor somewhat
      sombrely. On the front of a gable stood the words &lsquo;Nisi Dominus.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The vehicle drew up, and there descended a young man of pale countenance,
      his attire indicating long and hasty travel. He pulled vigorously at the
      end of a hanging bell-chain, and the door was immediately opened by a
      man-servant in black. Hubert, for he it was, pointed to his trunk, and,
      whilst it was being carried into the house, took some loose coin from his
      pocket. He handed the driver a sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no change, sir,&rsquo; said the man, after examining the coin. But
      Hubert had already turned away; he merely waved his hand, and entered the
      house. For a drive of two miles, the cabman held himself tolerably paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hall was dusky, and seemed in need of fresh air. Hubert threw off his
      hat, gloves, and overcoat; then for the first time spoke to the servant,
      who stood in an attitude of expectancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Eldon is at home?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At home, sir, but very unwell. She desires me to say that she fears she
      may not be able to see you this evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there a fire anywhere?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only in the library, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will dine there. And let a fire be lit in my bedroom.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir. Will you dine at once, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In an hour. Something light; I don&rsquo;t care what it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall the fire be lit in your bedroom at once, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At once, and a hot bath prepared. Come to the library and tell me when it
      is ready.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant silently departed. Hubert walked across the hall, giving a
      glance here and there, and entered the library. Nothing had been altered
      here since his father&rsquo;s, nay, since his grandfather&rsquo;s time. That
      grandfather&mdash;his name Hubert&mdash;had combined strong intellectual
      tendencies with the extravagant tastes which gave his already tottering
      house the decisive push. The large collection of superbly-bound books
      which this room contained were nearly all of his purchasing, for prior to
      his time the Eldons had not been wont to concern themselves with things of
      the mind. Hubert, after walking to the window and looking out for a moment
      on the side lawn, pushed a small couch near to the fireplace, and threw
      himself down at full length, his hands beneath his head. In a moment his
      position seemed to have become uneasy; he turned upon his side, uttering
      an exclamation as if of pain. A minute or two and again he moved, this
      time with more evident impatience. The next thing he did was to rise, step
      to the bell, and ring it violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same servant appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t the bath ready?&rsquo; Hubert asked. His former mode of speaking had been
      brief and decided; he was now almost imperious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe it will be in a moment, sir,&rsquo; was the reply, marked, perhaps,
      by just a little failure in the complete subservience expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert looked at the man for an instant with contracted brows, but merely
      said&mdash;&lsquo;Tell them to be quick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man returned in less than three minutes with a satisfactory
      announcement, and Eldon went upstairs to refresh himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later he had dined, with obvious lack of appetite, and was
      deriving but slight satisfaction from a cigar, when the servant entered
      with a message from Mrs. Eldon: she desired to see her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert threw his cigar aside, and made a gesture expressing his wish to be
      led to his mother&rsquo;s room. The man conducted him to the landing at the head
      of the first flight of stairs; there a female servant was waiting, who,
      after a respectful movement, led the way to a door at a few yards&rsquo; 
      distance. She opened it and drew back. Hubert passed into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was furnished in a very old-fashioned style&mdash;heavily, richly, and
      with ornaments seemingly procured rather as evidences of wealth than of
      taste; successive Mrs. Eldons had used it as a boudoir. The present lady
      of that name sat in a great chair near the fire. Though not yet fifty, she
      looked at least ten years older; her hair had streaks of white, and her
      thin delicate features were much lined and wasted. It would not be enough
      to say that she had evidently once been beautiful, for in truth she was so
      still, with a spiritual beauty of a very rare type. Just now her face was
      set in a sternness which did not seem an expression natural to it; the
      fine lips were much more akin to smiling sweetness, and the brows accepted
      with repugnance anything but the stamp of thoughtful charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first glance at Hubert she dropped her eyes. He, stepping
      quickly across the floor, put his lips to her cheek; she did not move her
      head, nor raise her hand to take his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you sit there, Hubert?&rsquo; she said, pointing to a chair which was
      placed opposite hers. The resemblance between her present mode of
      indicating a wish and her son&rsquo;s way of speaking to the servant below was
      very striking; even the quality of their voices had much in common, for
      Hubert&rsquo;s was rather high-pitched. In face, however, the young man did not
      strongly evidence their relation to each other: he was not handsome, and
      had straight low brows, which made his aspect at first forbidding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why have you not come to me before this?&rsquo; Mrs. Eldon asked when her son
      had seated himself, with his eyes turned upon the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was unable to, mother. I have been ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She cast a glance at him. There was no doubting the truth of what he said;
      at this moment he looked feeble and pain-worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where did your illness come upon you?&rsquo; she asked, her tone unsoftened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In Germany. I started only a few hours after receiving the letter in
      which you told me of the death.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My other letters you paid no heed to?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could not reply to them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke after hesitation, but firmly, as one does who has something to
      brave out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would have been better for you if you had been able, Hubert. Your
      refusal has best you dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Mutimer,&rsquo; his mother continued, a tremor in her voice, &lsquo;destroyed his
      will a day or two before he died.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert said nothing. His fingers, looked together before him, twitched a
      little; his face gave no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Had you come to me at once,&rsquo; Mrs. Eldon pursued, &lsquo;had you listened to my
      entreaties, to my commands&rsquo;&mdash;her voice rang right queenly&mdash;&lsquo;this
      would not have happened. Mr. Mutimer behaved as generously as he always
      has. As soon as there came to him certain news of you, he told me
      everything. I refused to believe what people were saying, and he too
      wished to do so. He would not write to you himself; there was one all
      sufficient test, he held, and that was a summons from your mother. It was
      a test of your honour, Hubert&mdash;and you failed under it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You received my letters?&rsquo; she went on to ask. &lsquo;I heard you had gone from
      England, and could only hope your letters would be forwarded. Did you get
      them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With the delay of only a day or two.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And deliberately you put me aside?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him now for several moments. Her eyes grew moist. Then she
      resumed, in a lower voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I said nothing of what was at stake, though I knew. Mr. Mutimer was
      perfectly open with me. &ldquo;I have trusted him implicitly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because
      I believe him as staunch and true as his brother. I make no allowances for
      what are called young man&rsquo;s follies: he must be above anything of that
      kind. If he is not&mdash;well, I have been mistaken in him, and I can&rsquo;t
      deal with him as I wish to do.&rdquo; You know what he was, Hubert, and you can
      imagine him speaking those words. We waited. The bad news was confirmed,
      and from you there came nothing. I would not hint at the loss you were
      incurring; of my own purpose I should have refrained from doing so, and
      Mr. Mutimer forbade me to appeal to anything but your better self. If you
      would not come to me because I wished it, I could not involve you and
      myself in shame by seeing you yield to sordid motives.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert raised his head. A choking voice kept him silent for a moment only.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother, the loss is nothing to you; you are above regrets of that kind;
      and for myself, I am almost glad to have lost it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In very truth,&rsquo; answered the mother, &lsquo;I care little about the wealth you
      might have possessed. What I do care for is the loss of all the hopes I
      had built upon you. I thought you honour itself; I thought you
      high-minded. Young as you are, I let you go from me without a fear.
      Hubert, I would have staked my life that no shadow of disgrace would ever
      fall upon your head! You have taken from me the last comfort of my age.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He uttered words she could not catch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The purity of your soul was precious to me,&rsquo; she continued, her accents
      struggling against weakness; &lsquo;I thought I had seen in you a love of that
      chastity without which a man is nothing; and I ever did my best to keep
      your eyes upon a noble ideal of womanhood. You have fallen. The simpler
      duty, the point of every-day honour, I could not suppose that you would
      fail in. From the day when you came of age, when Mr. Mutimer spoke to you,
      saying that in every respect you would be as his son, and you, for your
      part, accepted what he offered, you owed it to him to respect the lightest
      of his reasonable wishes. The wish which was supreme in him you have
      utterly disregarded. Is it that you failed to understand him? I have
      thought of late of a way you had now and then when you spoke to me about
      him; it has occurred to me that perhaps you did him less than justice.
      Regard his position and mine, and tell me whether you think he could have
      become so much to us if he had not been a gentleman in the highest sense
      of the word. When Godfrey first of all brought me that proposal from him
      that we should still remain in this house, it seemed to me the most
      impossible thing. You know what it was that induced me to assent, and what
      led to his becoming so intimate with us. Since then it has been hard for
      me to remember that he was not one of our family. His weak points it was
      not difficult to discover; but I fear you did not understand what was
      noblest in his character. Uprightness, clean-heartedness, good faith&mdash;these
      things he prized before everything. In you, in one of your birth, he
      looked to find them in perfection. Hubert, I stood shamed before him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man breathed hard, as if in physical pain. His eyes were fixed
      in a wide absent gaze. Mrs. Eldon had lost all the severity of her face;
      the profound sorrow of a pure and noble nature was alone to be read there
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What,&rsquo; she continued&mdash;&lsquo;what is this class distinction upon which we
      pride ourselves? What does it mean, if not that our opportunities lead us
      to see truths to which the eyes of the poor and ignorant are blind? Is
      there nothing in it, after all&mdash;in our pride of birth and station?
      That is what people are saying nowadays: you yourself have jested to me
      about our privileges. You almost make me dread that you were right. Look
      back at that man, whom I came to honour as my own father. He began life as
      a toiler with his hands. Only a fortnight ago he was telling me stories of
      his boyhood, of seventy years since. He was without education; his ideas
      of truth and goodness he had to find within his own heart. Could anything
      exceed the noble simplicity of his respect for me, for you boys? We were
      poor, but it seemed to him that we had from nature what no money could
      buy. He was wrong; his faith misled him. No, not wrong with regard to all
      of us; my boy Godfrey was indeed all that he believed. But think of
      himself; what advantage have we over him? I know no longer what to
      believe. Oh, Hubert!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He left his chair and walked to a more distant part of the room, where he
      was beyond the range of lamp and firelight. Standing here, he pressed his
      hand against his side, still breathing hard, and with difficulty
      suppressing a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came a step or two nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; he said, hurriedly, &lsquo;I am still far from well. Let me leave you:
      speak to me again to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eldon made an effort to rise, looking anxiously into the gloom where
      he stood. She was all but standing upright&mdash;a thing she had not done
      for a long time&mdash;when Hubert sprang towards her, seizing her hands,
      then supporting her in his arms. Her self-command gave way at length, and
      she wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert placed her gently in the chair and knelt beside her. He could find
      no words, but once or twice raised his face and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What caused your illness?&rsquo; she asked, speaking as one wearied with
      suffering. She lay back, and her eyes were closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot say,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;Do not speak of me. In your last letter
      there was no account of how he died.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was in church, at the morning service. The pew-opener found him
      sitting there dead, when all had gone away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the vicar could see into the pew from the pulpit? The death must have
      been very peaceful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, he could not see; the front curtains were drawn.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why was that, I wonder?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eldon shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you in pain?&rsquo; she asked suddenly. &lsquo;Why do you breathe so strangely?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A little pain. Oh, nothing; I will see Manns to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother gazed long and steadily into his eyes, and this time he bore
      her look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother, you have not kissed me,&rsquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And cannot, dear. There is too much between us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His head fell upon her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hubert!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How shall I live when you have gone from me again? When you say good-bye,
      it will be as if I parted from you for ever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unless,&rsquo; she continued&mdash;&lsquo;unless I have your promise that you will no
      longer dishonour yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose from her side and stood in front of the fire; his mother looked
      and saw that he trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No promise, Hubert,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that you cannot keep. Rather than that,
      we will accept our fate, and be nothing to each other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know very well, mother, that that is impossible. I cannot speak to
      you of what drove me to disregard your letters. I love and honour you, and
      shall have to change my nature before I cease to do so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To me, Hubert, you seem already to have changed. I scarcely know you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t defend myself to you,&rsquo; he said sadly. &lsquo;We think so differently on
      subjects which allow of no compromise, that, even if I could speak openly,
      you would only condemn me the more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother turned upon him a grief-stricken and wondering face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Since when have we differed so?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;What has made us strangers
      to each other&rsquo;s thoughts? Surely, surely you are at one with me in
      condemning all that has led to this? If your character has been too weak
      to resist temptation, you cannot have learnt to make evil your good?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You refuse me that last hope?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert moved impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother, I can&rsquo;t see beyond to-day! I know nothing of what is before me.
      It is the idlest trifling with words to say one will do this or that, when
      action in no way depends on one&rsquo;s own calmer thought. In this moment I
      could promise anything you ask; if I had my choice, I would be a child
      again and have no desire but to do your will, to be worthy in your eyes. I
      hate my life and the years that have parted me from you. Let us talk no
      more of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither spoke again for some moments; then Hubert asked coldly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What has been done?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Eldon, in the same tone. &lsquo;Mr. Yottle has waited
      for your return before communicating with the relatives in London.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will go to Belwick in the morning,&rsquo; he said. Then, after reflection,
      &lsquo;Mr. Mutimer told you that he had destroyed his will?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. He had it from Mr. Yottle two days before his death, and on the day
      after&mdash;the Monday&mdash;Mr. Yottle was to have come to receive
      instructions for a new one. It is nowhere to be found: of course it was
      destroyed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose there is no doubt of that?&rsquo; Hubert asked, with a show of
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There can be none. Mr. Yottle tells me that a will which existed. before
      Godfrey&rsquo;s marriage was destroyed in the same way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is the heir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A great-nephew bearing the same name. The will contained provision for
      him and certain of his family. Wanley is his; the personal property will
      be divided among several.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The people have not come forward?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We presume they do not even know of Mr. Mutimer&rsquo;s death. There has been
      no direct communication between him and them for many years.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert&rsquo;s next question was, &lsquo;What shall you do, mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does it interest you, Hubert? I am too feeble to move very far. I must
      find a home either here in the village or at Agworth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with compassion, with remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you, my boy?&rsquo; asked his mother, raising her eyes gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I? Oh, the selfish never come to harm, be sure! Only the gentle and
      helpless have to suffer; that is the plan of the world&rsquo;s ruling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The world is not ruled by one who thinks our thoughts, Hubert.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had it on his lips to make a rejoinder, but checked the impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say good-night to me,&rsquo; his mother continued. &lsquo;You must go and rest. If
      you still feel unwell in the morning, a messenger shall go to Belwick. You
      are very, very pale.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert held his hand to her and bent his head. Mrs. Eldon offered her
      cheek; he kissed it and went from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o&rsquo;clock on the following morning a bell summoned a servant to
      Hubert&rsquo;s bedroom. Though it was daylight, a lamp burned near the bed;
      Hubert lay against pillows heaped high.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let someone go at once for Dr. Manns,&rsquo; he said, appearing to speak with
      difficulty. &lsquo;I wish to see him as soon as possible. Mrs. Eldon is to know
      nothing of his visit&mdash;you understand me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant withdrew. In rather less than an hour the doctor made his
      appearance, with every sign of having been interrupted in his repose. He
      was a spare man, full bearded and spectacled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something wrong?&rsquo; was his greeting as he looked keenly at his summoner.
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; Hubert replied, &lsquo;something is confoundedly wrong. I have been
      playing strange tricks in the night, I fancy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fever?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As a consequence of something else. I shall have to tell you what must be
      repeated to no one, as of course you will see. Let me see, when was it?&mdash;Saturday
      to-day? Ten days ago, I had a pistol-bullet just here,&rsquo;&mdash;he touched
      his right side. &lsquo;It was extracted, and I seemed to be not much the worse.
      I have just come from Germany.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Manns screwed his face into an expression of sceptical amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At present,&rsquo; Hubert continued, trying to laugh, &lsquo;I feel considerably the
      worse. I don&rsquo;t think I could move if I tried. In a few minutes, ten to
      one, I shall begin talking foolery. You must keep people away; get what
      help is needed. I may depend upon you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor nodded, and, whistling low, began an examination.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the dun borderland of Islington and Hoxton, in a corner made by the
      intersection of the New North Road and the Regent&rsquo;s Canal, is discoverable
      an irregular triangle of small dwelling-houses, bearing the name of Wilton
      Square. In the midst stands an amorphous structure, which on examination
      proves to be a very ugly house and a still uglier Baptist chapel built
      back to back. The pair are enclosed within iron railings, and, more
      strangely, a circle of trees, which in due season do veritably put forth
      green leaves. One side of the square shows a second place of worship, the
      resort, as an inscription declares, of &lsquo;Welsh Calvinistic Methodists.&rsquo; The
      houses are of one storey, with kitchen windows looking upon small areas;
      the front door is reached by an ascent of five steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canal&mdash;<i>maladetta e sventurata fossa</i>&mdash;stagnating in
      utter foulness between coal-wharfs and builders&rsquo; yards, at this point
      divides two neighbourhoods of different aspects. On the south is Hoxton, a
      region of malodorous market streets, of factories, timber yards, grimy
      warehouses, of alleys swarming with small trades and crafts, of filthy
      courts and passages leading into pestilential gloom; everywhere toil in
      its most degrading forms; the thoroughfares thundering with high-laden
      waggons, the pavements trodden by working folk of the coarsest type, the
      corners and lurking-holes showing destitution at its ugliest. Walking
      northwards, the explorer finds himself in freer air, amid broader ways, in
      a district of dwelling-houses only; the roads seem abandoned to milkmen,
      cat&rsquo;s-meat vendors, and costermongers. Here will be found streets in which
      every window has its card advertising lodgings: others claim a higher
      respectability, the houses retreating behind patches of garden-ground, and
      occasionally showing plastered pillars and a balcony. The change is from
      undisguised struggle for subsistence to mean and spirit-broken leisure;
      hither retreat the better-paid of the great slave-army when they are free
      to eat and sleep. To walk about a neighbourhood such as this is the
      dreariest exercise to which man can betake himself; the heart is crushed
      by uniformity of decent squalor; one remembers that each of these
      dead-faced houses, often each separate blind window, represents a &lsquo;home,&rsquo; 
      and the associations of the word whisper blank despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilton Square is on the north side of the foss, on the edge of the quieter
      district, and in one of its houses dwelt at the time of which I write the
      family on whose behalf Fate was at work in a valley of mid-England. Joseph
      Mutimer, nephew to the old man who had just died at Wanley Manor, had
      himself been at rest for some five years; his widow and three children
      still lived together in the home they had long occupied. Joseph came of a
      family of mechanics; his existence was that of the harmless necessary
      artisan. He earned a living by dint of incessant labour, brought up his
      family in an orderly way, and departed with a certain sense of
      satisfaction at having fulfilled obvious duties&mdash;the only result of
      life for which he could reasonably look. With his children we shall have
      to make closer acquaintance; but before doing so, in order to understand
      their position and follow with intelligence their several stories, it will
      be necessary to enter a little upon the subject of ancestry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph Mutimer&rsquo;s father, Henry by name, was a somewhat remarkable
      personage. He grew to manhood in the first decade of our century, and
      wrought as a craftsman in a Midland town. He had a brother, Richard, some
      ten years his junior, and the two were of such different types of
      character, each so pronounced in his kind, that, after vain attempts to
      get along together, they parted for good, heedless of each other
      henceforth, pursuing their sundered destinies. Henry was by nature a
      political enthusiast, of insufficient ballast, careless of the main
      chance, of hot and ready tongue; the Chartist movement gave him
      opportunities of action which he used to the utmost, and he became a
      member of the so-called National Convention, established in Birmingham in
      1839. Already he had achieved prominence by being imprisoned as the leader
      of a torch-light procession, and this taste of martyrdom naturally
      sharpened his zeal. He had married young, but only visited his family from
      time to time. His wife for the most part earned her own living, and
      ultimately betook herself to London with her son Joseph, the single
      survivor of seven children. Henry pursued his career of popular agitation,
      supporting himself in miscellaneous ways, writing his wife an affectionate
      letter once in six months, and making himself widely known as an
      uncompromising Radical of formidable powers. Newspapers of that time
      mention his name frequently; he was always in hot water, and once or twice
      narrowly escaped transportation. In 1842 he took active part in the riots
      of the Midland Counties, and at length was unfortunate enough to get his
      head broken. He died in hospital before any relative could reach him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard Mutimer regarded with detestation the principles to which Henry
      had sacrificed his life. From childhood he was staid, earnest, and
      iron-willed; to whatsoever he put his hand, he did it thoroughly, and it
      was his pride to receive aid from no man. Intensely practical, he early
      discerned the truth that a man&rsquo;s first object must be to secure himself a
      competency, seeing that to one who lacks money the world is but a great
      debtors&rsquo; prison. To make money, therefore, was his aim, and anything that
      interfered with the interests of commerce and industry from the
      capitalist&rsquo;s point of view he deemed unmitigated evil. When his brother
      Henry was leading processions and preaching the People&rsquo;s Charter, Richard
      enrolled himself as a special constable, cursing the tumults which drew
      him from business, but determined, if he got the opportunity, to strike a
      good hard blow in defence of law and order. Already he was well on the way
      to possess a solid stake in the country, and the native conservatism of
      his temperament grew stronger as circumstances bent themselves to his
      will; a proletarian conquering wealth and influence naturally prizes these
      things in proportion to the effort their acquisition has cost him. When he
      heard of his brother&rsquo;s death, he could in conscience say nothing more than
      &lsquo;Serve him right!&rsquo; For all that, he paid the funeral expenses of the
      Chartist&mdash;angrily declining an offer from Henry&rsquo;s co-zealots, who
      would have buried the martyr at their common charges&mdash;and proceeded
      to inquire after the widow and son. Joseph Mutimer, already one- or
      two-and-twenty, was in no need of help; he and his mother, naturally
      prejudiced against the thriving uncle, declared themselves satisfied with
      their lot, and desired no further connection with a relative who was
      practically a stranger to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Richard went on his way and heaped up riches. When already middle-aged
      he took to himself a wife, his choice being marked with characteristic
      prudence. The woman he wedded was turned thirty, had no money, and few
      personal charms, but was a lady. Richard was fully able to appreciate
      education and refinement; to judge from the course of his later life, one
      would have said that he had sought money only as a means, the end he
      really aimed at being the satisfaction of instincts which could only have
      full play in a higher social sphere. No doubt the truth was that success
      sweetened his character, and developed, as is so often the case, those
      possibilities of his better nature which a fruitless struggle would have
      kept in the germ or altogether crushed. His excellent wife influenced him
      profoundly; at her death the work was continued by the daughter she left
      him. The defects of his early education could not of course be repaired,
      but it is never too late for a man to go to school to the virtues which
      civilise. Remaining the sturdiest of Conservatives, he bowed in sincere
      humility to those very claims which the Radical most angrily disallows:
      birth, hereditary station, recognised gentility&mdash;these things made
      the strongest demand upon his reverence. Such an attitude was a testimony
      to his own capacity for culture, since he knew not the meaning of vulgar
      adulation, and did in truth perceive the beauty of those qualities to
      which the uneducated Iconoclast is wholly blind. It was a joyous day for
      him when he saw his daughter the wife of Godfrey Eldon. The loss which so
      soon followed was correspondingly hard to bear, and but for Mrs. Eldon&rsquo;s
      gentle sympathy he would scarcely have survived the blow. We know already
      how his character had impressed that lady; such respect was not lightly to
      be won, and he came to regard it as the most precious thing that life had
      left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man was not perfect, and his latest practical undertaking
      curiously enough illustrated the failing which he seemed most completely
      to have outgrown. It was of course a deplorable error to think of mining
      in the beautiful valley which had once been the Eldons&rsquo; estate. Richard
      Mutimer could not perceive that. He was a very old man, and possibly the
      instincts of his youth revived as his mind grew feebler; he imagined it
      the greatest kindness to Mrs. Eldon and her son to increase as much as
      possible the value of the property he would leave at his death. They, of
      course, could not even hint to him the pain with which they viewed so
      barbarous a scheme; he did not as much as suspect a possible objection.
      Intensely happy in his discovery and the activity to which it led, he
      would have gone to his grave rich in all manner of content but for that
      fatal news which reached him from London, where Hubert Eldon was sup posed
      to be engaged in sober study in an interval of University work. Doubtless
      it was this disappointment that caused his sudden death, and so brought
      about a state of things which could he have foreseen it, would have
      occasioned him the bitterest grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never lost sight of his relatives in London, and had made for them
      such modest provision as suited his view of the fitness of things. To
      leave wealth to young men of the working class would have seemed to him
      the most inexcusable of follies; if such were to rise at all, it must be
      by their own efforts and in consequence of their native merits; otherwise,
      let them toil on and support themselves honestly. From secret sources he
      received information of the capabilities and prospects of Joseph Mutimer&rsquo;s
      children, and the items of his will were regulated accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we return to the family in Wilton Square. Let us, before proceeding
      with the story, enumerate the younger Mutimers. The first-born, now aged
      five-and-twenty, had his great-uncle&rsquo;s name; Joseph Mutimer, married, and
      no better off in worldly possessions than when he had only himself to
      support, came to regret the coldness with which he had received the
      advances of his uncle the capitalist, and christened his son Richard, with
      half a hope that some day the name might stand the boy in stead. Richard
      was a mechanical engineer, employed in certain ironworks where hydraulic
      machinery was made. The second child was a girl, upon whom had been
      bestowed the names Alice Maud, after one of the Queen&rsquo;s daughters; on
      which account, and partly with reference to certain personal
      characteristics, she was often called &lsquo;the Princess.&rsquo; Her age was
      nineteen, and she had now for two years been employed in the show-rooms of
      a City warehouse. Last comes Henry, a lad of seventeen; he had been
      suffered to aim at higher things than the rest of the family. In the
      industrial code of precedence the rank of clerk is a step above that of
      mechanic, and Henry&mdash;known to relatives and friends as &lsquo;Arry&mdash;occupied
      the proud position of clerk in a drain-pipe manufactory.

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      At ten o&rsquo;clock on the evening of Easter Sunday, Mrs. Mutimer was busy
      preparing supper. She had laid the table for six, had placed at one end of
      it a large joint of cold meat, at the other a vast flee-pudding, already
      diminished by attack, and she was now slicing a conglomerate mass of cold
      potatoes and cabbage prior to heating it in the frying-pan, which hissed
      with melted dripping just on the edge of the fire. The kitchen was small,
      and everywhere reflected from some bright surface either the glow of the
      open grate or the yellow lustre of the gas-jet; red curtains drawn across
      the window added warmth and homely comfort to the room. It was not the
      kitchen of pinched or slovenly working folk; the air had a scent of
      cleanliness, of freshly scrubbed boards and polished metal, and the
      furniture was super-abundant. On the capacious dresser stood or hung
      utensils innumerable; cupboards and chairs had a struggle for wall space;
      every smallest object was in the place assigned to it by use and wont.
    </p>
    <p>
      The housewife was an active woman of something less than sixty; stout,
      fresh-featured, with a small keen eye, a firm mouth, and the look of one
      who, conscious of responsibilities, yet feels equal to them; on the whole
      a kindly and contented face, if lacking the suggestiveness which comes of
      thought. At present she seemed on the verge of impatience; it was supper
      time, but her children lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There they are, and there they must wait, I s&rsquo;pose,&rsquo; she murmured to
      herself as she finished slicing the vegetables and went to remove the pan
      a little from the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      A knock at the house door called her upstairs. She came down again,
      followed by a young girl of pleasant countenance, though pale and
      anxious-looking. The visitor&rsquo;s dress was very plain, and indicated
      poverty; she wore a long black jacket, untrimmed, a boa of cheap fur, tied
      at the throat with black ribbon, a hat of grey felt, black cotton gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one here?&rsquo; she asked, seeing the empty kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Goodness knows where they all are. I s&rsquo;pose Dick&rsquo;s at his meeting; but
      Alice and &lsquo;Arry had ought to be back by now. Sit you down to the table,
      and I&rsquo;ll put on the vegetables; there&rsquo;s no call to wait for them. Only I
      ain&rsquo;t got the beer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, but I didn&rsquo;t mean to come for supper,&rsquo; said the girl, whose name was
      Emma Vine. &lsquo;I only ran in to tell you poor Jane&rsquo;s down again with
      rheumatic fever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mutimer was holding the frying-pan over the fire, turning the
      contents over and over with a knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that!&rsquo; she exclaimed, looking over her shoulder. &lsquo;Why,
      it&rsquo;s the fifth time, ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is indeed, and worse to get through every time. We didn&rsquo;t expect she&rsquo;d
      ever be able to walk again last autumn.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear, dear! what a thing them rheumatics is, to be sure! And you&rsquo;ve heard
      about Dick, haven&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heard what?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I thought maybe it had got to you. He&rsquo;s lost his work, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lost his work?&rsquo; the girl repeated, with dismay. &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why? What else had he to expect? &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t likely they&rsquo;ll keep a man as
      goes about making all his mates discontented and calling his employers
      names at every street corner. I&rsquo;ve been looking for it every week.
      Yesterday one of the guvnors calls him up and tells him&mdash;just in a
      few civil words&mdash;as perhaps it &lsquo;ud be better for all parties if he&rsquo;d
      find a place where he was more satisfied. &ldquo;Well an&rsquo; good,&rdquo; says Dick&mdash;you
      know his way&mdash;and there he is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl had seated herself, and listened to this story with downcast
      eyes. Courage seemed to fail her; she drew a long, quiet sigh. Her face
      was of the kind that expresses much sweetness in irregular features. Her
      look was very honest and gentle, with pathetic meanings for whoso had the
      eye to catch them; a peculiar mobility of the lips somehow made one think
      that she had often to exert herself to keep down tears. She spoke in a
      subdued voice, always briefly, and with a certain natural refinement in
      the use of uncultured language. When Mrs. Mutimer ceased, Emma kept
      silence, and smoothed the front of her jacket with an unconscious movement
      of the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mutimer glanced at her and showed commiseration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, don&rsquo;t you worrit about it, Emma,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve quite
      enough on your hands. Dick don&rsquo;t care&mdash;not he; he couldn&rsquo;t look more
      high-flyin&rsquo; if someone had left him a fortune. He says it&rsquo;s the best thing
      as could happen. Nay, I can&rsquo;t explain; he&rsquo;ll tell you plenty soon as he
      gets in. Cut yourself some meat, child, do, and don&rsquo;t wait for me to help
      you. See, I&rsquo;ll turn you out some potatoes; you don&rsquo;t care for the greens,
      I know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fry had hissed vigorously whilst this conversation went on; the
      results were brown and unctuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, if it ain&rsquo;t too bad!&rsquo; cried the old woman, losing self-control.
      &lsquo;That &lsquo;Arry gets later every Sunday, and he knows very well as I have to
      wait for the beer till he comes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;ll fetch it,&rsquo; said Emma, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You indeed! I&rsquo;d like to see Dick if he caught me a-sending you to the
      public-house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t mind it for once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You get on with your supper, do. It&rsquo;s only my fidgetiness; I can do very
      well a bit longer. And Alice, where&rsquo;s she off to, I wonder? What it is to
      have a girl that age! I wish they was all like you, Emma. Get on with your
      supper, I tell you, or you&rsquo;ll make me angry. Now, it ain&rsquo;t no use taking
      it to &lsquo;eart in that way. I see what you&rsquo;re worritin&rsquo; over. Dick ain&rsquo;t the
      man to be out o&rsquo; work long.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But won&rsquo;t it be the same at his next place?&rsquo; Emma inquired. She was
      trying to eat, but it was a sad pretence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, there&rsquo;s no telling. It&rsquo;s no good my talkin&rsquo; to him. Why don&rsquo;t you
      see what you can do, Emma? &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t as if he&rsquo;d no one but his own self to
      think about Don&rsquo;t you think you could make him see that? If anyone has a
      right to speak, it&rsquo;s you. Tell him as he&rsquo;d ought to have a bit more
      thought. It&rsquo;s wait, wait, wait, and likely to be if things go on like
      this. Speak up and tell him as&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t do that!&rsquo; murmured Emma. &lsquo;Dick knows best.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped to listen; there was a noise above as of people entering the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here they come at last,&rsquo; said Mrs. Mutimer. &lsquo;Hear him laughin&rsquo;? Now,
      don&rsquo;t you be so ready to laugh with him. Let him see as it ain&rsquo;t such good
      fun to everybody.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavy feet tramped down the stone stairs, amid a sound of loud laughter
      and excited talk. The next moment the kitchen door was thrown open, and
      two young men appeared. The one in advance was Richard Mutimer; behind him
      came a friend of the family, Daniel Dabbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what do you think of this?&rsquo; Richard exclaimed as he shook Emma&rsquo;s
      hands rather carelessly. &lsquo;Mother been putting you out of spirits, I
      suppose? Why, it&rsquo;s grand; the best thing that could have happened! What a
      meeting we&rsquo;ve had to-night! What do <i>you</i> say, Dan?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard represented&mdash;too favourably to make him anything but an
      exception&mdash;the best qualities his class can show. He was the English
      artisan as we find him on rare occasions, the issue of a good strain which
      has managed to procure a sufficiency of food for two or three generations.
      His physique was admirable; little short of six feet in stature, he had
      shapely shoulders, an erect well-formed head, clean strong limbs, and a
      bearing which in natural ease and dignity matched that of the picked men
      of the upper class&mdash;those fine creatures whose career, from public
      school to regimental quarters, is one exclusive course of bodily training.
      But the comparison, on the whole, was to Richard&rsquo;s advantage. By no
      possibility could he have assumed that aristocratic vacuity of visage
      which comes of carefully induced cerebral atrophy. The air of the workshop
      suffered little colour to dwell upon his cheeks; but to features of so
      pronounced and intelligent a type this pallor added a distinction. He had
      dark brown hair, thick and long, and a cropped beard of hue somewhat
      lighter. His eyes were his mother&rsquo;s&mdash;keen and direct; but they had
      small variety of expression; you could not imagine them softening to
      tenderness, or even to thoughtful dreaming. Terribly wide awake, they
      seemed to be always looking for the weak points of whatever they regarded,
      and their brightness was not seldom suggestive of malice. His voice was
      strong and clear; it would ring out well in public places, which is
      equivalent to saying that it hardly invited too intimate conference. You
      will take for granted that Richard displayed, alike in attitude and tone,
      a distinct consciousness of his points of superiority to the men among
      whom he lived; probably he more than suspected that he could have held his
      own in spheres to which there seemed small chance of his being summoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just now he showed at once the best and the weakest of his points. Coming
      in a state of exaltation from a meeting of which he had been the eloquent
      hero, such light as was within him flashed from his face freely; all the
      capacity and the vigour which impelled him to strain against the strait
      bonds of his lot set his body quivering and made music of his utterance.
      At the same time, his free movements passed easily into swagger, and as he
      talked on, the false notes were not few. A working man gifted with brains
      and comeliness must, be sure of it, pay penalties for his prominence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite another man was Daniel Dabbs: in him you saw the proletarian pure
      and simple. He was thick-set, square-shouldered, rolling in gait; he
      walked with head bent forward and eyes glancing uneasily, as if from lack
      of self-confidence. His wiry black hair shone with grease, and no accuracy
      of razor-play would make his chin white. A man of immense strength, but
      bull-necked and altogether ungainly&mdash;his heavy fist, with its black
      veins and terrific knuckles, suggested primitive methods of settling
      dispute; the stumpy fingers, engrimed hopelessly, and the filthy broken
      nails, showed how he wrought for a living. His face, if you examined it
      without prejudice, was not ill to look upon; there was much good humour
      about the mouth, and the eyes, shrewd enough, could glimmer a kindly light
      His laughter was roof-shaking&mdash;always a good sign in a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what have <i>you</i> got to say of these fine doings, Mr. Dabbs?&rsquo; 
      Mrs. Mutimer asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s like this &lsquo;era, Mrs. Mutimer,&rsquo; Daniel began, having seated
      himself, with hands on widely-parted knees. &lsquo;As far as the theory goes,
      I&rsquo;m all for Dick; any man must be as knows his two times two. But about
      the Longwoods; well, I tell Dick they&rsquo;ve a perfect right to get rid of
      him, finding him a dangerous enemy, you see. It was all fair and above
      board. Young Stephen Longwood ups an&rsquo; says&mdash;leastways not in these
      words, but them as means the same&mdash;says he, &ldquo;Look &lsquo;ere, Mutimer,&rdquo; he
      says, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve no fault to find with you as a workman, but from what we hear
      of you, it seems you don&rsquo;t care much for us as employers. Hadn&rsquo;t you
      better find a shop as is run on Socialist principles?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s all about
      it, you see; it&rsquo;s a case of incompatible temperaments; there&rsquo;s no
      ill-feelin&rsquo;, not as between man and man, And that&rsquo;s what I say, too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Dick,&rsquo; said Mrs. Mutimer, &lsquo;before you begin your sermon, who&rsquo;s
      a-going to fetch my beer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Right, Mrs. Mutimer!&rsquo; cried Daniel, slapping his leg. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I call
      coming from theory to practice. Beer squares all&mdash;leastways for the
      time being&mdash;only for the time being, Dick. Where&rsquo;s the jug? Better
      give me two jugs; we&rsquo;ve had a thirsty night of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll make capital of this!&rsquo; said Richard, walking about the room in
      Daniel&rsquo;s absence. &lsquo;The great point gained is, they&rsquo;ve shown they&rsquo;re afraid
      of me. We&rsquo;ll write it up in the paper next week, see if we don&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;ll do
      us a sight of good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And where&rsquo;s your weekly wages to come from?&rsquo; inquired his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll look after that. I only wish they&rsquo;d refuse me all round; the
      more of that kind of thing the better for us. I&rsquo;m not afraid but I can
      earn my living.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Through all this Emma Vine had sat with her thoughtful eyes constantly
      turned on Richard. It was plain how pride struggled with anxiety in her
      mind. When Richard had kept silence for a moment, she ventured to speak,
      having tried in vain to meet his look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jane&rsquo;s ill again, Richard,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer had to summon his thoughts from a great distance; his endeavour to
      look sympathetic was not very successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not the fever again?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it is,&rsquo; she replied sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Going to work in the wet, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders; in his present mood the fact was not so much
      personally interesting to him as in the light of another case against
      capitalism. Emma&rsquo;s sister had to go a long way to her daily employment,
      and could not afford to ride; the fifth attack of rheumatic fever was the
      price she paid for being permitted to earn ten shillings a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel returned with both jugs foaming, his face on a broad grin of
      anticipation. There was a general move to the table. Richard began to
      carve roast beef like a freeman, not by any means like the serf he had
      repeatedly declared himself in the course of the evening&rsquo;s oratory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her Royal &lsquo;Ighness out?&rsquo; asked Daniel, with constraint not solely due to
      the fact that his mouth was full.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s round at Mrs. Took&rsquo;s, I should think,&rsquo; was Mrs. Mutimer&rsquo;s reply.
      &lsquo;Staying supper, per&rsquo;aps.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard, after five minutes of surprising trencher-work, recommenced
      conversation. The proceedings of the evening at the hall, which was the
      centre for Socialist gatherings in this neighbourhood, were discussed by
      him and Daniel with much liveliness. Dan was disposed to take the meeting
      on its festive and humorous side; for him, economic agitation was a mode
      of passing a few hours amid congenial uproar. Whenever stamping and
      shouting were called for, Daniel was your man. Abuse of employers, it was
      true, gave a zest to the occasion, and to applaud the martyrdom of others
      was as cheery an occupation as could be asked; Daniel had no idea of
      sacrificing his own weekly wages, and therein resembled most of those who
      had been loud in uncompromising rhetoric. Richard, on the other hand, was
      unmistakably zealous. His sense of humour was not strong, and in any case
      he would have upheld the serious dignity of his own position. One saw from
      his way of speaking, that he believed himself about to become a popular
      hero; already in imagination he stood forth on platforms before vast
      assemblies, and heard his own voice denouncing capitalism with force which
      nothing could resist. The first taste of applause had given extraordinary
      impulse to his convictions, and the personal ambition with which they were
      interwoven. His grandfather&rsquo;s blood was hot in him to-night. Henry
      Mutimer, dying in hospital of his broken skull, would have found
      euthanasia, could he in vision have seen this worthy descendant entering
      upon a career in comparison with which his own was unimportant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The high-pitched voices and the clatter of knives and forks allowed a
      new-comer to enter the kitchen without being immediately observed. It was
      a tall girl of interesting and vivacious appearance; she wore a dress of
      tartan, a very small hat trimmed also with tartan and with a red feather,
      a tippet of brown fur about her shoulders, and a muff of the same material
      on one of her hands. Her figure was admirable; from the crest of her
      gracefully poised head to the tip of her well-chosen boot she was, in line
      and structure, the type of mature woman. Her face, if it did not indicate
      a mind to match her frame, was at the least sweet-featured and provoking;
      characterless somewhat, but void of danger-signals; doubtless too good to
      be merely played with; in any case, very capable of sending a ray, in one
      moment or another, to the shadowy dreaming-place of graver thoughts. Alice
      Maud Mutimer was nineteen. For two years she had been thus tall, but the
      grace of her proportions had only of late fully determined itself. Her
      work in the City warehouse was unexacting; she had even a faint impress of
      rose-petal on each cheek, and her eye was excellently clear. Her lips,
      unfortunately never quite closed, betrayed faultless teeth. Her likeness
      to Richard was noteworthy; beyond question she understood the charm of her
      presence, and one felt that the consciousness might, in her case,
      constitute rather a safeguard than otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood with one hand on the door, surveying the table. When the
      direction of Mrs. Mutimer&rsquo;s eyes at length caused Richard and Daniel to
      turn their heads, Alice nodded to each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What noisy people! I heard you out in the square.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was moving past the table, but Daniel, suddenly backing his chair,
      intercepted her. The girl gave him her hand, and, by way of being jocose,
      he squeezed it so vehemently that she uttered a shrill &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave go, Mr. Dabbs! Leave go, I tell you! How dare you? I&rsquo;ll hit you as
      hard as I can!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel laughed obstreperously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do! do!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;What a mighty blow that &lsquo;ud be! Only the left hand,
      though. I shall get over it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrenched herself away, gave Daniel a smart slap on the back, and ran
      round to the other side of the table, where she kissed Emma
      affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How thirsty I am!&rsquo; she exclaimed. &lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t drunk all the beer, I
      hope.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that,&rsquo; Dan replied. &lsquo;Why, there ain&rsquo;t more than &lsquo;arf a
      pint; that&rsquo;s not much use for a Royal &lsquo;Ighness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She poured it into a glass. Alice reached across the table, raised the
      glass to her lips, and&mdash;emptied it. Then she threw off hat, tippet,
      and gloves, and seated herself But in a moment she was up and at the
      cupboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, mother, you don&rsquo;t&mdash;you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> say as there&rsquo;s not a
      pickle!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tone was deeply reproachful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, there now,&rsquo; replied her mother, laughing; &lsquo;I knew what it &lsquo;ud be! I
      meant to a&rsquo; got them last night. You&rsquo;ll have to make shift for once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess took her seat with an air of much dejection. Her pretty lips
      grew mutinous; she pushed her plate away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No supper for me! The idea of cold meat without a pickle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the time?&rsquo; cried Daniel. &lsquo;Not closing time yet. I can get a pickle
      at the &ldquo;Duke&rsquo;s Arms.&rdquo; Give me a glass, Mrs. Mutimer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice looked up slily, half smiling, half doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may go,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I like to see strong men make themselves useful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan rose, and was off at once. He returned with the tumbler full of
      pickled walnuts. Alice emptied half a dozen into her plate, and put one of
      them whole into her mouth. She would not have been a girl of her class if
      she had not relished this pungent dainty. Fish of any kind, green
      vegetables, eggs and bacon, with all these a drench of vinegar was
      indispensable to her. And she proceeded to eat a supper scarcely less
      substantial than that which had appeased her brother&rsquo;s appetite. Start
      not, dear reader; the Princess is only a subordinate heroine, and happens,
      moreover, to be a living creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you take a walnut, Miss Vine?&rsquo; Daniel asked, pushing the tumbler to
      the quiet girl, who had scarcely spoken through the meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      She declined the offered dainty, and at the same time rose from the table,
      saying aside to Mrs. Mutimer that she must be going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I suppose you must,&rsquo; was the reply. &lsquo;Shall you have to sit up with
      Jane?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not all night, I don&rsquo;t expect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard likewise left his place, and, when she offered to bid him
      good-night, said that he would walk a little way with her. In the passage
      above, which was gas-lighted, he found his hat on a nail, and the two left
      the house together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you really mind?&rsquo; Emma asked, looking up into his face as they took
      their way out of the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not I! I can get a job at Baldwin&rsquo;s any day. But I dare say I shan&rsquo;t want
      one long.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not want work?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Work? Oh, plenty of work; but perhaps not the same kind. We want men who
      can give their whole time to the struggle&mdash;to go about lecturing and
      the like. Of course, it isn&rsquo;t everybody can do it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The remark indicated his belief that he knew one man not incapable of
      leading functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And would they pay you?&rsquo; Emma inquired, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Expenses of that kind are inevitable,&rsquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Issuing into the New North Road, where there were still many people
      hastening one way and the other, they turned to the left, crossed the
      canal&mdash;black and silent&mdash;and were soon among narrow streets.
      Every corner brought a whiff of some rank odour, which stole from closed
      shops and warehouses, and hung heavily on the still air. The public-houses
      had just extinguished their lights, and in the neighbourhood of each was a
      cluster of lingering men and women, merry or disputatious. Mid-Easter was
      inviting repose and festivity; to-morrow would see culmination of riot,
      and after that it would only depend upon pecuniary resources how long the
      muddled interval between holiday and renewed labour should drag itself
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end of their walk was the entrance to a narrow passage, which, at a
      few yards&rsquo; distance, widened itself and became a street of four-storeyed
      houses. At present this could not be discerned; the passage was a mere
      opening into massive darkness. Richard had just been making inquiries
      about Emma&rsquo;s sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve had the doctor?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re obliged; she does so dread going to the hospital again. Each
      time she&rsquo;s longer in getting well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard&rsquo;s hand was in his pocket; he drew it out and pressed something
      against the girl&rsquo;s palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, how can I?&rsquo; she said, dropping her eyes. &lsquo;No&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      ashamed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; he urged, not unkindly. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have to get her what
      the doctor orders, and it isn&rsquo;t likely you and Kate can afford it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re always so kind, Richard. But I am&mdash;I am ashamed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say, Emma, why don&rsquo;t you call me Dick? I&rsquo;ve meant to ask you that many
      a time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her face away, moving as if abashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It sounds&mdash;perhaps I want to make a difference from
      what the others call you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed with a sound of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you mustn&rsquo;t stand here; it&rsquo;s a cold night. Try and come Tuesday or
      Wednesday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good night!&rsquo; he said, and, as he held her hand, bent to the lips which
      were ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma walked along the passage, and for some distance up the middle of the
      street. Then she stopped and looked up at one of the black houses. There
      were lights, more or less curtain-dimmed, in nearly all the windows. Emma
      regarded a faint gleam in the topmost storey. To that she ascended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer walked homewards at a quick step, whistling to himself. A
      latch-key gave him admission. As he went down the kitchen stairs, he heard
      his mother&rsquo;s voice raised in anger, and on opening the door he found that
      Daniel had departed, and that the supper table was already cleared. Alice,
      her feet on the fender and her dress raised a little, was engaged in
      warming herself before going to bed. The object of Mrs. Mutimer&rsquo;s
      chastisement was the youngest member of the family, known as &lsquo;Arry; even
      Richard, who had learnt to be somewhat careful in his pronunciation, could
      not bestow the aspirate upon his brother&rsquo;s name. Henry, aged seventeen,
      promised to do credit to the Mutimers in physical completeness; already he
      was nearly as tall as his eldest brother; and, even in his lankness,
      showed the beginnings of well-proportioned vigour. But the shape of his
      head, which was covered with hair of the lightest hue, did not encourage
      hope of mental or moral qualities. It was not quite fair to judge his face
      as seen at present; the vacant grin of half timid, half insolent,
      resentment made him considerably more simian of visage than was the case
      under ordinary circumstances. But the features were unpleasant to look
      upon; it was Richard&rsquo;s face, distorted and enfeebled with impress of
      sensual instincts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As long as you live in this house, it shan&rsquo;t go on,&rsquo; his mother was
      saying. &lsquo;Sunday or Monday, it&rsquo;s no matter; you&rsquo;ll be home before eleven
      o&rsquo;clock, and you&rsquo;ll come home sober. You&rsquo;re no better than a pig!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arry was seated in a far corner of the room, where he had dropped his
      body on entering. His attire was such as the cheap tailors turn out in
      imitation of extreme fashions: trousers closely moulded upon the leg, a
      huff waistcoat, a short coat with pockets everywhere. A very high collar
      kept his head up against his will; his necktie was crimson, and passed
      through a brass ring; he wore a silver watch-chain, or what seemed to be
      such. One hand was gloved, and a cane lay across his knees. His attitude
      was one of relaxed muscles, his legs very far apart, his body not quite
      straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What d&rsquo; you call sober, I&rsquo;d like to know?&rsquo; he replied, with looseness of
      utterance. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m as sober &lsquo;s anybody in this room. If a chap can&rsquo;t go out
      with &lsquo;s friends &lsquo;t Easter an&rsquo; all&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Easter, indeed! It&rsquo;s getting to be a regular thing, Saturday and Sunday.
      Get up and go to bed! I&rsquo;ll have my say out with you in the morning, young
      man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go to bed!&rsquo; repeated the lad with scorn. &lsquo;Tell you I ain&rsquo;t had no
      supper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard had walked to the neighbourhood of the fireplace, and was
      regarding his brother with anger and contempt. At this point of the dialogue
      he interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you won&rsquo;t have any, either, that I&rsquo;ll see to! What&rsquo;s more, you&rsquo;ll do
      as your mother bids you, or I&rsquo;ll know the reason why. Go upstairs at
      once!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a command to be disregarded. &lsquo;Arry rose, but half-defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you to do with it? You&rsquo;re not my master.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you hear what I say?&rsquo; Richard observed, yet more autocratically. &lsquo;Take
      yourself off, and at once!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad growled, hesitated, but approached the door. His motion was
      slinking; he could not face Richard&rsquo;s eye. They heard him stumble up the
      stairs.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      On ordinary days Richard of necessity rose early; a holiday did not lead
      him to break the rule, for free hours were precious. He had his body well
      under control; six hours of sleep he found sufficient to keep him in
      health, and temptations to personal ease, in whatever form, he resisted as
      a matter of principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Easter Monday found him down-stairs at half-past six. His mother would
      to-day allow herself another hour. &lsquo;Arry would be down just in time to
      breakfast, not daring to be late. The Princess might be looked for&mdash;some
      time in the course of the morning; she was licensed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard, for purposes of study, used the front parlour. In drawing up the
      blind, he disclosed a room precisely resembling in essential features
      hundreds of front parlours in that neighbourhood, or, indeed, in any
      working-class district of London. Everything was clean; most things were
      bright-hued or glistening of surface. There was the gilt-framed mirror
      over the mantelpiece, with a yellow clock&mdash;which did not go&mdash;and
      glass ornaments in front. There was a small round table before the window,
      supporting wax fruit under a glass case. There was a hearthrug with a
      dazzling pattern of imaginary flowers. On the blue cloth of the middle
      table were four showily-bound volumes, arranged symmetrically. On the head
      of the sofa lay a covering worked of blue and yellow Berlin wools. Two
      arm-chairs were draped with long white antimacassars, ready to slip off at
      a touch. As in the kitchen, there was a smell of cleanlines&mdash;of
      furniture polish, hearthstone, and black-lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should mention the ornaments of the walls. The pictures were: a striking
      landscape of the Swiss type, an engraved portrait of Garibaldi, an
      unframed view of a certain insurance office, a British baby on a large
      scale from the Christmas number of an illustrated paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one singular feature of the room was a small, glass-doored bookcase,
      full of volumes. They were all of Richard&rsquo;s purchasing; to survey them was
      to understand the man, at all events on his intellectual side. Without
      exception they belonged to that order of literature which, if studied
      exclusively and for its own sake,&mdash;as here it was,&mdash;brands a man
      indelibly, declaring at once the incompleteness of his education and the
      deficiency of his instincts. Social, political, religious,&mdash;under
      these three heads the volumes classed themselves, and each class was
      represented by productions of the &lsquo;extreme&rsquo; school. The books which a
      bright youth of fair opportunities reads as a matter of course, rejoices
      in for a year or two, then throws aside for ever, were here treasured to
      be the guides of a lifetime. Certain writers of the last century, long ago
      become only historically interesting, were for Richard an armoury whence
      he girded himself for the battles of the day; cheap reprints or
      translations of Malthus, of Robert Owen, of Volney&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ruins,&rsquo; of Thomas
      Paine, of sundry works of Voltaire, ranked upon his shelves. Moreover,
      there was a large collection of pamphlets, titled wonderfully and of yet
      more remarkable contents, the authoritative utterances of contemporary
      gentlemen&mdash;and ladies&mdash;who made it the end of their existence to
      prove: that there cannot by any possibility be such a person as Satan;
      that the story of creation contained in the Book of Genesis is on no
      account to be received; that the begetting of children is a most
      deplorable oversight; that to eat flesh is wholly unworthy of a civilised
      being; that if every man and woman performed their quota of the world&rsquo;s
      labour it would be necessary to work for one hour and thirty-seven minutes
      daily, no jot longer, and that the author, in each case, is the one person
      capable of restoring dignity to a down-trodden race and happiness to a
      blasted universe. Alas, alas! On this food had Richard Mutimer pastured
      his soul since he grew to manhood, on this and this only. English
      literature was to him a sealed volume; poetry he scarcely knew by name; of
      history he was worse than ignorant, having looked at this period and that
      through distorting media, and congratulating himself on his clear vision
      because he saw men as trees walking; the bent of his mind would have led
      him to natural science, but opportunities of instruction were lacking, and
      the chosen directors of his prejudice taught him to regard every fact,
      every discovery, as <i>for</i> or <i>against</i> something.
    </p>
    <p>
      A library of pathetic significance, the individual alone considered.
      Viewed as representative, not without alarming suggestiveness to those who
      can any longer trouble themselves about the world&rsquo;s future. One dreams of
      the age when free thought&mdash;in the popular sense&mdash;will have
      become universal, when art shall have lost its meaning, worship its
      holiness, when the Bible will only exist in &lsquo;comic&rsquo; editions, and
      Shakespeare be down-cried by &lsquo;most sweet voices as a mountebank of
      reactionary tendencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard was to lecture on the ensuing Sunday at one of the branch
      meeting-places of his society; he engaged himself this morning in
      collecting certain data of a statistical kind. He was still at his work
      when the sound of the postman&rsquo;s knock began to be heard in the square,
      coming from house to house, drawing nearer at each repetition. Richard
      paid no heed to it; he expected no letter. Yet it seemed there was one for
      some member of the family; the letter-carrier&rsquo;s regular tread ascended the
      five steps to the door, and then two small thunderclaps echoed through the
      house. There was no letter-box; Richard went to answer the knock. An
      envelope addressed to himself in a small, formal hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts still busy with other things, he opened the letter
      mechanically as he re-entered the room. He had never in his life been
      calmer; the early hour of study had kept his mind pleasantly active whilst
      his breakfast appetite sharpened itself. Never was man less prepared to
      receive startling intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read, then raised his eyes and let them stray from the papers on the
      table to the wax-fruit before the window, thence to the young leafage of
      the trees around the Baptist Chapel. He was like a man whose face had been
      overflashed by lightning. He read again, then, holding the letter behind
      him, closed his right hand upon his beard with thoughtful tension. He read
      a third time, then returned the letter to its envelope, put it in his
      pocket, and sat down again to his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was summoned to breakfast in ten minutes. His mother was alone in the
      kitchen; she gave him his bloater and his cup of coffee, and he cut
      himself a solid slice of bread and butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was the letter for you?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied with a nod, and fell patiently to work on the dissection of his
      bony delicacy. In five minutes Henry approached the table with a furtive
      glance at his elder brother. But Richard had no remark to make. The meal
      proceeded in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Richard had finished, he rose and said to his mother&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you that railway-guide I brought home a week ago?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe I have somewhere. Just look in the cupboard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The guide was found. Richard consulted it for a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have to go out of London,&rsquo; he then observed. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s just possible I
      shan&rsquo;t get back to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A little talk followed about the arrangements of the day, and whether
      anyone was likely to be at home for dinner. Richard did not show much
      interest in the matter; he went upstairs whistling, and changed the
      clothing he wore for his best suit. In a quarter of an hour he had left
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not return till the evening of the following day. It was presumed
      that he had gone &lsquo;after a job.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached home his mother and Alice were at tea. He walked to the
      kitchen fireplace, turned his back to it, and gazed with a peculiar
      expression at the two who sat at table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dick&rsquo;s got work,&rsquo; observed Alice, after a glance at him. &lsquo;I can see that
      in his face.&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you, Dick?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Mutimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have. Work likely to last.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So we&rsquo;ll hope,&rsquo; commented his mother. &lsquo;Where is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A good way out of London. Pour me a cup, mother. Where&rsquo;s &lsquo;Arry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gone out, as usual.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why are you having tea with your hat on, Princess?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I&rsquo;m in a hurry, if you must know everything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard did not seek further information. He drank his tea standing. In
      five minutes Alice had bustled away for an evening with friends. Mrs.
      Mutimer cleared the table without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now get your sewing, mother, and sit down,&rsquo; began Richard. &lsquo;I want to
      have a talk with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother cast a rather suspicious glance. There was an impressiveness in
      the young man&rsquo;s look and tone which disposed her to obey without remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long is it,&rsquo; Richard asked, when attention waited upon him, &lsquo;since
      you heard anything of father&rsquo;s uncle, my namesake?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mutimer&rsquo;s face exhibited the dawning of intelligence, an unwrinkling
      here and there, a slight rounding of the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what of him?&rsquo; she asked in an undertone, leaving a needle
      unthreaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old man&rsquo;s just dead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Agitation seized the listener, agitation of a kind most unusual in her.
      Her hands trembled, her eyes grew wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t heard anything of him lately?&rsquo; pursued Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heard? Not I. No more did your father ever since two years afore we was
      married. I&rsquo;d always thought he was dead long ago. What of him, Dick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From what I&rsquo;m told I thought you&rsquo;d perhaps been keeping things to
      yourself. &lsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t have been unlike you, mother. He knew all about us,
      so the lawyer tells me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The lawyer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;d better out with it. He&rsquo;s died without a will. His real property&mdash;that
      means his houses and land&mdash;belongs to me; his personal property&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      his money&mdash;&lsquo;ll have to be divided between me, and Alice, and &lsquo;Arry.
      You&rsquo;re out of the sharing, mother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He said it jokingly, but Mrs. Mutimer did not join in his laugh. Her palms
      were closely pressed together; still trembling, she gazed straight before
      her, with a far-off look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His houses&mdash;his land?&rsquo; she murmured, as if she had not quite heard.
      &lsquo;What did he want with more than one house?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The absurd question was all that could find utterance. She seemed to be
      reflecting on that point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you like to hear what it all comes to?&rsquo; Richard resumed. His voice
      was unnatural, forcibly suppressed, quivering at pauses. His eyes gleamed,
      and there was a centre of warm colour on each of his cheeks. He had taken
      a note-book from his pocket, and the leaves rustled under his tremulous
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The lawyer, a man called Yottle, just gave me an idea of the different
      investments and so on. The real property consists of a couple of houses in
      Belwick, both let, and an estate at a place called Wanley. The old man had
      begun mining there; there&rsquo;s iron. I&rsquo;ve got my ideas about that. I didn&rsquo;t
      go into the house; people are there still. Now the income.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He read his notes: So much in railways, so much averaged yearly from
      iron-works in Belwick, so much in foreign securities, so much disposable
      at home. Total&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop, Dick, stop!&rsquo; uttered his mother, under her breath. &lsquo;Them figures
      frighten me; I don&rsquo;t know what they mean. It&rsquo;s a mistake; they&rsquo;re leading
      you astray. Now, mind what I say&mdash;there&rsquo;s a mistake! No man with all
      that money &lsquo;ud die without a will. You won&rsquo;t get me to believe it, Dick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard laughed excitedly. &lsquo;Believe it or not, mother; I&rsquo;ve got my ears
      and eyes, I hope. And there&rsquo;s a particular reason why he left no will.
      There was one, but something&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what&mdash;happened just
      before his death, and he was going to make a new one. The will was burnt.
      He died in church on a Sunday morning; if he&rsquo;d lived another day, he&rsquo;d
      have made a new will. It&rsquo;s no more a mistake than the Baptist Chapel is in
      the square!&rsquo; A comparison which hardly conveyed all Richard&rsquo;s meaning; but
      he was speaking in agitation, more and more quickly, at last almost
      angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mutimer raised her hand. &lsquo;Be quiet a bit, Dick. It&rsquo;s took me too
      sudden. I feel queer like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence. The mother rose as if with difficulty, and drew water
      in a tea-cup from the filter. When she resumed her place, her hands
      prepared to resume sewing. She looked up, solemnly, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dick, it&rsquo;s bad, bad news! I&rsquo;m an old woman, and I must say what I think.
      It upsets me; it frightens me. I thought he might a&rsquo; left you a hundred
      pounds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother, don&rsquo;t talk about it till you&rsquo;ve had time to think,&rsquo; said Richard,
      stubbornly. &lsquo;If this is bad news, what the deuce would you call good? Just
      because I&rsquo;ve been born and bred a mechanic, does that say I&rsquo;ve got no
      common sense or self-respect? Are you afraid I shall go and drink myself
      to death? You talk like the people who make it their business to sneer at
      us&mdash;the improvidence of the working classes, and such d&mdash;d
      slander. It&rsquo;s good news for me, and it&rsquo;ll be good news for many another
      man. Wait and see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother became silent, keeping her lips tight, and struggling to regain
      her calmness. She was not convinced, but in argument with her eldest son
      she always gave way, affection and the pride she had in him aiding her
      instincts of discretion. In practice she still maintained something of
      maternal authority, often gaining her point by merely seeming offended. To
      the two who had not yet reached the year of emancipation she allowed, in
      essentials, no appeal from her decision. Between her and Richard there had
      been many a sharp conflict in former days, invariably ending with the
      lad&rsquo;s submission; the respect which his mother exacted he in truth felt to
      be her due, and it was now long since they had openly been at issue on any
      point. Mrs. Mutimer&rsquo;s views were distinctly Conservative, and hitherto she
      had never taken Richard&rsquo;s Radicalism seriously; on the whole she had
      regarded it as a fairly harmless recreation for his leisure hours&mdash;decidedly
      preferable to a haunting of public-houses and music-halls. The loss of his
      employment caused her a good deal of uneasiness, but she had not ventured
      to do more than throw out hints of her disapproval; and now, as it seemed,
      the matter was of no moment. Henceforth she had far other apprehensions,
      but this first conflict of their views made her reticent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just let me tell you how things stand,&rsquo; Richard pursued, when his
      excitement had somewhat subsided; and he went on to explain the relations
      between old Mr. Mutimer and the Eldons, which in outline had been
      described to him by Mr. Yottle. And then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The will he had made left all the property to this young Eldon, who was
      to be trustee for a little money to be doled out to me yearly, just to
      save me from ruining myself, of course.&rsquo; Richard&rsquo;s lips curled in scorn.
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether the lawyer thought we ought to offer to give
      everything up; he seemed precious anxious to make me understand that the
      old man had never intended us to have it, and that he <i>did</i> want
      these other people to have it. Of course, we&rsquo;ve nothing to do with that.
      Luck&rsquo;s luck, and I think I know who&rsquo;ll make best use of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell all this when Alice was here?&rsquo; inquired his mother,
      seeming herself again, though very grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you. I thought it over, and it seems to me it&rsquo;ll be better if
      Alice and &lsquo;Arry wait a while before they know what&rsquo;ll come to them. They
      can&rsquo;t take anything till they&rsquo;re twenty-one. Alice is a good girl, but&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated, having caught his mother&rsquo;s eye. He felt that this prudential
      course justified in a measure her anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a girl,&rsquo; he pursued, &lsquo;and we know that a girl with a lot o&rsquo; money
      gets run after by men who care nothing about her and a good deal about the
      money. Then it&rsquo;s quite certain &lsquo;Arry won&rsquo;t be any the better for fancying
      himself rich. H&rsquo;s going to give us trouble as it is, I can see that. We
      shall have to take another house, of course, and we can&rsquo;t keep them from
      knowing that there&rsquo;s money fallen to me. But there&rsquo;s no need to talk about
      the figures, and if we can make them think it&rsquo;s only me that&rsquo;s better off,
      so much the better. Alice needn&rsquo;t go to work, and I&rsquo;m glad of it; a girl&rsquo;s
      proper place is at home. You can tell her you want her to help in the new
      house. &lsquo;Arry had better keep his place awhile. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if I
      find work for him myself before long I&rsquo;ve got plans, but I shan&rsquo;t talk
      about them just yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke then of the legal duties which fell upon him as next-of-kin,
      explaining the necessity of finding two sureties on taking out letters of
      administration. Mr. Yottle had offered himself for one; the other Richard
      hoped to find in Mr. Westlake, a leader of the Socialist movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You want us to go into a big house?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Mutimer. She seemed to
      pay little attention to the wider aspects of the change, but to fix on the
      details she could best understand, those which put her fears in palpable
      shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t say a big one, but a larger than this. We&rsquo;re not going to play
      the do-nothing gentlefolk; but all the same our life won&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t be
      what it has been. There&rsquo;s no choice. You&rsquo;ve worked hard all your life,
      mother, and it&rsquo;s only fair you should come in for a bit of rest. We&rsquo;ll
      find a house somewhere out Green Lanes way, or in Highbury or Holloway.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So there&rsquo;s the best of it&mdash;the worst of it, as you say. Just take a
      night to turn it over. Most likely I shall go to Belwick again to-morrow
      afternoon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and his mother, after bending her head to bite off an end of
      cotton, asked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll tell Emma?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall go round to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later Richard left the house for this purpose. His step was
      firmer than ever, his head more upright Walking along the crowded streets,
      he saw nothing; there was a fixed smile on his lips, the smile of a man to
      whom the world pays tribute. Never having suffered actual want, and
      blessed with sanguine temperament, he knew nothing of that fierce
      exultation, that wrathful triumph over fate, which comes to men of
      passionate mood smitten by the lightning-flash of unhoped prosperity. At
      present he was well-disposed to all men; even against capitalists and
      &lsquo;profitmongers&rsquo; he could not have railed heartily Capitalists? Was he not
      one himself? Aye, but he would prove himself such a one as you do not meet
      with every day; and the foresight of deeds which should draw the eyes of
      men upon him, which should shout his name abroad, softened his judgments
      with the charity of satisfied ambition. He would be the glorified
      representative of his class. He would show the world how a self-taught
      working man conceived the duties and privileges of wealth. He would shame
      those dunder-headed, callous-hearted aristocrats, those ravening
      bourgeois. Opportunity&mdash;what else had he wanted? No longer would his
      voice be lost in petty lecture-halls, answered only by the applause of a
      handful of mechanics. Ere many months had passed, crowds should throng to
      hear him; his gospel would be trumpeted over the land. To what might he
      not attain? The educated, the refined, men and women&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was at the entrance of a dark passage, where his feet stayed themselves
      by force of habit. He turned out of the street, and walked more slowly
      towards the house in which Emma Vine and her sisters lived. Having reached
      the door, he paused, but again took a few paces forward. Then he came back
      and rang the uppermost of five bells. In waiting, he looked vaguely up and
      down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Emma herself who opened to him. The dim light showed a smile of
      pleasure and surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve come to ask about Jane?&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;She hasn&rsquo;t been quite so bad
      since last night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it. Can I come up?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered, and Emma closed the door. It was pitch dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I&rsquo;d brought a candle down,&rsquo; Emma said, moving back along the
      passage. &lsquo;Mind there&rsquo;s a pram at the foot of the stairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The perambulator was avoided successfully by both, and they ascended the
      bare boards of the staircase. On each landing prevailed a distinct odour;
      first came the damp smell of newly-washed clothes, then the scent of fried
      onions, then the workroom of some small craftsman exhaled varnish. The
      topmost floor seemed the purest; it was only stuffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard entered an uncarpeted room which had to serve too many distinct
      purposes to allow of its being orderly in appearance. In one corner was a
      bed, where two little children lay asleep; before the window stood a
      sewing-machine, about which was heaped a quantity of linen; a table in the
      midst was half covered with a cloth, on which was placed a loaf and
      butter, the other half being piled with several dresses requiring the
      needle. Two black patches on the low ceiling showed in what positions the
      lamp stood by turns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma&rsquo;s eldest sister was moving about the room. Hers were the children;
      her husband had been dead a year or more. She was about thirty years of
      age, and had a slatternly appearance; her face was peevish, and seemed to
      grudge the half-smile with which it received the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve no need to look round you,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;We&rsquo;re in &amp; regular
      pig-stye, and likely to be. Where&rsquo;s there a chair?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook some miscellaneous articles on to the floor to provide a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t speak too loud, and wake them children. Bertie&rsquo;s
      had the earache; he&rsquo;s been crying all day. What with him and Jane we&rsquo;ve
      had a blessing, I can tell you. Can I put these supper things away, Emma?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rsquo; was the other&rsquo;s reply. &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you have a bit more, Kate?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got no mind for eating. Well, you may cut a slice and put it on the
      mantelpiece. I&rsquo;ll go and sit with Jane.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard sat and looked about the room absently. The circumstances of his
      own family had never fallen below the point at which it is possible to
      have regard for decency; the growing up of himself and of his brothers and
      sister had brought additional resources to meet extended needs, and the
      Mutimer characteristics had formed a safeguard against improvidence. He
      was never quite at his ease in this poverty-cumbered room, which he seldom
      visited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ought to have a fire,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s one in the other room,&rsquo; replied Kate. &lsquo;One has to serve us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you can&rsquo;t cook there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cook? We can boil a potato, and that&rsquo;s about all the cooking we can do
      now-a-days.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved to the door as she spoke, and, before leaving the room, took
      advantage of Richard&rsquo;s back being turned to make certain exhortatory signs
      to her sister. Emma averted her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate closed the door behind her. Emma, having removed the eatables to the
      cupboard, came near to Richard and placed her arm gently upon his
      shoulders. He looked at her kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kate&rsquo;s been so put about with Bertie,&rsquo; she said, in a tone of excuse.
      &lsquo;And she was up nearly all last night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She never takes things like you do,&rsquo; Richard remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s got more to bear. There&rsquo;s the children always making her anxious.
      She took Alf to the hospital this afternoon, and the doctor says he must
      have&mdash;I forget the name, somebody&rsquo;s food. But it&rsquo;s two-and-ninepence
      for ever such a little tin. They don&rsquo;t think as his teeth &lsquo;ll ever come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I daresay they will,&rsquo; said Richard encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had put his arm about her. Emma knelt down by him, and rested her head
      against his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m tired,&rsquo; she whispered. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had to go twice to the Minories to-day.
      I&rsquo;m so afraid I shan&rsquo;t be able to hold my eyes open with Jane, and Kate&rsquo;s
      tireder still.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not speak as if seeking for sympathy it was only the natural
      utterance of her thoughts in a moment of restful confidence. Uttermost
      weariness was a condition too familiar to the girl to be spoken of in any
      but a patient, matter-of-fact tone. But it was priceless soothing to let
      her forehead repose against the heart whose love was the one and
      sufficient blessing of her life. Her brown hair was very soft and fine; a
      lover of another kind would have pressed his lips upon it. Richard was
      thinking of matters more practical. At another time his indignation&mdash;in
      such a case right good and manful&mdash;would have boiled over at the
      thought of these poor women crushed in slavery to feed the world&rsquo;s dastard
      selfishness; this evening his mood was more complaisant, and he smiled as
      one at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better give up your work?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma raised her head. In the few moments of repose her eyelids had drooped
      with growing heaviness; she looked at him as if she had just been awakened
      to some great surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give up work? How can I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I would. You&rsquo;d have more time to give to Jane, and you could
      sleep in the day. And Jane had better not begin again after this. Don&rsquo;t
      you think it would be better if you left these lodgings and took a house,
      where there&rsquo;d be plenty of room and fresh air?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Richard, what are you talking about?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, quietly, on account of the sleeping children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How would you like,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;to go and live in the country? Kate
      and Jane could have a house of their own, you know&mdash;in London, I
      mean, a house like ours; they could let a room or two if they chose. Then
      you and I could go where we liked. I was down in the Midland Counties
      yesterday; had to go on business; and I saw a house that would just suit
      us. It&rsquo;s a bit large; I daresay there&rsquo;s sixteen or twenty rooms. And
      there&rsquo;s trees growing all about it; a big garden&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma dropped her head again and laughed, happy that Richard should jest
      with her so good-humouredly; for he did not often talk in the lighter way.
      She had read of such houses in the weekly story-papers. It must be nice to
      live in them; it must be nice to be a denizen of Paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m in earnest, Emma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice caused her to gaze at him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bring a chair,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll tell you something that&rsquo;ll&mdash;keep
      you awake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The insensible fellow! Her sweet, pale, wondering face was so close to
      his, the warmth of her drooping frame was against his heart&mdash;and he
      bade her sit apart to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She placed herself as he desired, sitting with her hands together in her
      lap, her countenance troubled a little, wishing to smile, yet not quite
      venturing. And he told his story, told it in all details, with figures
      that filled the mouth, that rolled forth like gold upon the bank-scales.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is mine,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;mine and yours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you seen a child listening to a long fairy tale, every page a new
      adventure of wizardry, a story of elf, or mermaid, or gnome, of treasures
      underground guarded by enchanted monsters, of bells heard silverly in the
      depth of old forests, of castles against the sunset, of lakes beneath the
      quiet moon? Know you how light gathers in the eyes dreaming on vision
      after vision, ever more intensely realised, yet ever of an unknown world?
      How, when at length the reader&rsquo;s voice is silent, the eyes still see, the
      ears still hear, until a movement breaks the spell, and with a deep,
      involuntary sigh the little one gazes here and there, wondering?
    </p>
    <p>
      So Emma listened, and so she came back to consciousness, looking about the
      room, incredulous. Had she been overcome with weariness? Had she slept and
      dreamt?
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the children stirred and uttered a little wailing sound. She
      stepped lightly to the bedside, bent for a moment, saw that all was well
      again, and came back on tip-toe. The simple duty had quieted her throbbing
      heart. She seated herself as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What about the country house now?&rsquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say. It&rsquo;s more than I can take into my head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not going to say, like mother did, that it was the worst piece of
      news she&rsquo;d ever heard?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your mother said that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma was startled. Had her thought passed lightly over some danger? She
      examined her mind rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose she said it,&rsquo; Richard explained, &lsquo;just because she didn&rsquo;t know
      what else to say, that&rsquo;s about the truth. But there certainly is one thing
      I&rsquo;m a little anxious about, myself. I don&rsquo;t care for either Alice or &lsquo;Arry
      to know the details of this windfall. They won&rsquo;t come in for their share
      till they&rsquo;re of age, and it&rsquo;s just as well they should think it&rsquo;s only a
      moderate little sum. So don&rsquo;t talk about it, Emma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was still musing on Mrs. Mutimer&rsquo;s remark; she merely shook her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t think you were going to marry a man with his thousands and be
      a lady? Well, I shall have more to say in a day or two. But at present my
      idea is that mother and the rest of them shall go into a larger house, and
      that you and Kate and Jane shall take our place. I don&rsquo;t know how long
      it&rsquo;ll be before those Eldon people can get out of Wanley Manor, but as
      soon as they do, why then there&rsquo;s nothing to prevent you and me going into
      it. Will that suit you, Em?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall really live in that big house?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly we shall. I&rsquo;ve got a life&rsquo;s work before me there, as far as I
      can see at present. The furniture belongs to Mrs. Eldon, I believe; we&rsquo;ll
      furnish the place to suit ourselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I tell my sisters, Richard?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just tell them that I&rsquo;ve come in for some money and a house, perhaps
      that&rsquo;s enough. And look here, I&rsquo;ll leave you this five-pound note to go on
      with. You must get Jane whatever the doctor says. And throw all that
      sewing out of the windows; we&rsquo;ll have no more convict labour. Tell Jane to
      get well just as soon as it suits her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But&mdash;all this money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve plenty. The lawyer advanced me some for present needs. Now it&rsquo;s
      getting late, I must go. I&rsquo;ll write and tell you when I shall be home
      again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand, but the girl embraced him with the restrained
      tenderness which in her spoke so eloquently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you glad, Emma?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very glad, for your sake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And just a bit for your own, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never thought about money,&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;It was quite enough to be
      your wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the simple truth.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      At eleven o&rsquo;clock the next morning Richard presented himself at the door
      of a house in Avenue Road, St. John&rsquo;s Wood, and expressed a desire to see
      Mr. Westlake. That gentleman was at home; he received the visitor in his
      study&mdash;a spacious room luxuriously furnished, with a large window
      looking upon a lawn. The day was sunny and warm, but a clear fire
      equalised the temperature of the room. There was an odour of good tobacco,
      always most delightful when it blends with the scent of rich bindings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Richard&rsquo;s first visit to this house. A few days ago he would, in
      spite of himself, have been somewhat awed by the man-servant at the door,
      the furniture of the hall, the air of refinement in the room he entered.
      At present he smiled on everything. Could he not command the same as soon
      as he chose?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Westlake rose from his writing-table and greeted his visitor with a
      hearty grip of the hand. He was a man pleasant to look upon; his face,
      full of intellect, shone with the light of good-will, and the easy
      carelessness of his attire prepared one for the genial sincerity which
      marked his way of speaking. He wore a velvet jacket, a grey waistcoat
      buttoning up to the throat, grey trousers, fur-bordered slippers; his
      collar was very deep, and instead of the ordinary shirt-cuffs, his wrists
      were enclosed in frills. Long-haired, full-bearded, he had the forehead of
      an idealist and eyes whose natural expression was an indulgent smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man of letters, he had struggled from obscure poverty to success and
      ample means; at three-and-thirty he was still hard pressed to make both
      ends meet, but the ten subsequent years had built for him this pleasant
      home and banished his long familiar anxieties to the land of nightmare.
      &lsquo;It came just in time,&rsquo; he was in the habit of saying to those who had his
      confidence. &lsquo;I was at the point where a man begins to turn sour, and I
      should have soured in earnest.&rsquo; The process had been most effectually
      arrested. People were occasionally found to say that his books had a tang
      of acerbity; possibly this was the safety-valve at work, a hint of what
      might have come had the old hunger-demons kept up their goading. In the
      man himself you discovered an extreme simplicity of feeling, a frank
      tenderness, a noble indignation. For one who knew him it was not difficult
      to understand that he should have taken up extreme social views, still
      less that he should act upon his convictions. All his writing foretold
      such a possibility, though on the other hand it exhibited devotion to
      forms of culture which do not as a rule predispose to democratic
      agitation. The explanation was perhaps too simple to be readily hit upon;
      the man was himself so supremely happy that with his disposition the
      thought of tyrannous injustice grew intolerable to him. Some incidents
      happened to set his wrath blazing, and henceforth, in spite of not a
      little popular ridicule and much shaking of the head among his friends,
      Mr. Westlake had his mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have come to ask your advice and help,&rsquo; began Mutimer with directness.
      He was conscious of the necessity of subduing his voice, and had a certain
      pleasure in the ease with which he achieved this feat. It would not have
      been so easy a day or two ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, about this awkward affair of yours,&rsquo; observed Mr. Westlake with
      reference to Richard&rsquo;s loss of his employment, of which, as editor of the
      Union&rsquo;s weekly paper, he had of course at once been apprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, not about that. Since then a very unexpected thing has happened to
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The story was once more related, vastly to Mr. Westlake&rsquo;s satisfaction.
      Cheerful news concerning his friends always put him in the best of
      spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come, Mutimer, this&rsquo;ll never do! I&rsquo;m not sure that we shall not
      have to consider your expulsion from the Union.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard went on to mention the matters of legal routine in which he hoped
      Mr. Westlake would serve him. These having been settled&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish to speak of something more important,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You take it for
      granted, I hope, that I&rsquo;m not going to make the ordinary use of this
      fortune. As yet I&rsquo;ve only been able to hit on a few general ideas; I&rsquo;m
      clear as to the objects I shall keep before me, but how best to serve them
      wants more reflection. I thought if I talked it over with you in the first
      place&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and a lady half entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I thought you were alone,&rsquo; she remarked to Mr. Westlake. &lsquo;Forgive
      me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in! Here&rsquo;s our friend Mutimer. You know Mrs. Westlake?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A few words had passed between this lady and Richard in the lecture-room a
      few weeks before. She was not frequently present at such meetings, but had
      chanced, on the occasion referred to, to hear Mutimer deliver an harangue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have no objection to talk of your plans? Join our council, will you?&rsquo; 
      he added to his wife. &lsquo;Our friend brings interesting news.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westlake walked across the room to the curved window-seat. Her age
      could scarcely be more than three- or four-and-twenty; she was very dark,
      and her face grave almost to melancholy. Black hair, cut short at its
      thickest behind her neck, gave exquisite relief to features of the purest
      Greek type. In listening to anything that held her attention her eyes grew
      large, and their dark orbs seemed to dream passionately. The white swan&rsquo;s
      down at her throat&mdash;she was perfectly attired&mdash;made the skin
      above resemble rich-hued marble, and indeed to gaze at her long was to be
      impressed as by the sad loveliness of a supreme work of art. As Mutimer
      talked she leaned forward, her elbow on her knee, the back of her hand
      supporting her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband recounted what Richard had told him, and the latter proceeded
      to sketch the projects he had in view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My idea is,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to make the mines at Wanley the basis of great
      industrial undertakings, just as any capitalist might, but to conduct
      these undertakings in a way consistent with our views. I would begin by
      building furnaces, and in time add engineering works on a large scale. I
      would build houses for the men, and in fact make that valley an industrial
      settlement conducted on Socialist principles. Practically I can devote the
      whole of my income; my personal expenses will not be worth taking into
      account. The men must be paid on a just scheme, and the margin of profit
      that remains, all that we can spare from the extension of the works, shall
      be devoted to the Socialist propaganda. In fact, I should like to make the
      executive committee of the Union a sort of board of directors&mdash;and in
      a very different sense from the usual&mdash;for the Wanley estate. My
      personal expenditure deducted, I should like such a committee to have the
      practical control of funds. All this wealth was made by plunder of the
      labouring class, and I shall hold it as trustee for them. Do these ideas
      seem to you of a practical colour?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Westlake nodded slowly twice. His wife kept her listening attitude
      unchanged; her eyes &lsquo;dreamed against a distant goal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As I see the scheme,&rsquo; pursued Richard, who spoke all along somewhat in
      the lecture-room tone, the result of a certain embarrassment, &lsquo;it will
      differ considerably from the Socialist experiments we know of. We shall be
      working not only to support ourselves, but every bit as much set on profit
      as any capitalist in Belwick. The difference is, that the profit will
      benefit no individual, but the Cause. There&rsquo;ll be no attempt to carry out
      the idea of every man receiving the just outcome of his labour; not
      because I shouldn&rsquo;t be willing to share in that way, but simply because we
      have a greater end in view than to enrich ourselves. Our men must all be
      members of the Union, and their prime interest must be the advancement of
      the principles of the Union. We shall be able to establish new papers, to
      hire halls, and to spread ourselves over the country. It&rsquo;ll be fighting
      the capitalist manufacturers with their own weapons. I can see plenty of
      difficulties, of course. All England &lsquo;ll be against us. Never mind, we&rsquo;ll
      defy them all, and we&rsquo;ll win. It&rsquo;ll be the work of my life, and we&rsquo;ll see
      if an honest purpose can&rsquo;t go as far as a thievish one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The climax would have brought crashing cheers at Commonwealth Hall; in Mr.
      Westlake&rsquo;s study it was received with well-bred expressions of approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Mutimer,&rsquo; exclaimed the idealist, &lsquo;all this is intensely
      interesting, and right glorious for us. One sees at last a possibility of
      action. I ask nothing better than to be allowed to work with you. It
      happens very luckily that you are a practical engineer. I suppose the
      mechanical details of the undertaking are entirely within your province.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not quite, at present,&rsquo; Mutimer admitted, &lsquo;but I shall have valuable
      help. Yesterday I had a meeting with a man named Rodman, a mining
      engineer, who has been working on the estate. He seems just the man I
      shall want; a Socialist already, and delighted to join in the plans I just
      hinted to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Capital! Do you propose, then, that we shall call a special meeting of
      the Committee? Or would you prefer to suggest a committee of your own?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I think our own committee will do very well, at all events for the
      present. The first thing, of course, is to get the financial details of
      our scheme put into shape. I go to Belwick again this afternoon; my
      solicitor must get his business through as soon as possible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will reside for the most part at Wanley?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At the Manor, yes. It is occupied just now, but I suppose will soon be
      free.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know that part of the country, Stella?&rsquo; Mr. Westlake asked of his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      She roused herself, drawing in her breath, and uttered a short negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As soon as I get into the house,&rsquo; Richard resumed to Mr. Westlake, &lsquo;I
      hope you&rsquo;ll come and examine the place. It&rsquo;s unfortunate that the railway
      misses it by about three miles, but Rodman tells me we can easily run a
      private line to Agworth station. However, the first thing is to get our
      committee at work on the scheme.&rsquo; Richard repeated this phrase with gusto.
      &lsquo;Perhaps you could bring it up at the Saturday meeting?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be in town on Saturday?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; I have a lecture in Islington on Sunday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Saturday will do, then. Is this confidential?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all. We may as well get as much encouragement out of it as we can.
      Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard did not give expression to his thought that a paragraph on the
      subject in the Union&rsquo;s weekly organ, the &lsquo;Fiery Cross,&rsquo; might be the best
      way of promoting such encouragement; but he delayed his departure for a
      few minutes with talk round about the question of the prudence which must
      necessarily be observed in publishing a project so undigested. Mr.
      Westlake, who was responsible for the paper, was not likely to transgress
      the limits of good taste, and when Richard, on Saturday morning, searched
      eagerly the columns of the &lsquo;Cross,&rsquo; he was not altogether satisfied with
      the extreme discretion which marked a brief paragraph among those headed:
      &lsquo;From Day to Day.&rsquo; However, many of the readers were probably by that time
      able to supply the missing proper-name.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not the fault of Daniel Dabbs if members of the Hoxton and
      Islington branch of the Union read the paragraph without understanding to
      whom it referred. Daniel was among the first to hear of what had befallen
      the Mutimer family, and from the circle of his fellow-workmen the news
      spread quickly. Talk was rife on the subject of Mutimer&rsquo;s dismissal from
      Longwood Brothers&rsquo;, and the sensational rumour which followed so quickly
      found an atmosphere well prepared for its transmission. Hence the unusual
      concourse at the meeting-place in Islington next Sunday evening, where, as
      it became known to others besides Socialists, Mutimer was engaged to
      lecture. Richard experienced some vexation that his lecture was not to be
      at Commonwealth Hall, where the gathering would doubtless have been much
      larger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Union was not wealthy. The central hall was rented at Mr. Westlake&rsquo;s
      expense; two or three branches were managing with difficulty to support
      regular places of assembly, such as could not being obliged as yet to
      content themselves with open-air lecturing. In Islington the leaguers met
      in a room behind a coffee-shop, ordinarily used for festive purposes;
      benches were laid across the floor, and an estrade at the upper end
      exalted chairman and lecturer. The walls were adorned with more or less
      striking advertisements of non-alcoholic beverages, and with a few prints
      from the illustrated papers. The atmosphere was tobaccoey, and the
      coffee-shop itself, through which the visitors had to make their way,
      suggested to the nostrils that bloaters are the working man&rsquo;s chosen
      delicacy at Sunday tea. A table just within the door of the lecture-room
      exposed for sale sundry Socialist publications, the latest issue of the
      &lsquo;Fiery Cross&rsquo; in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard was wont to be among the earliest arrivals: to-night he was full
      ten minutes behind the hour for which the lecture was advertised. A group
      of friends were standing about the table near the door; they received him
      with a bustle which turned all eyes thitherwards. He walked up the middle
      of the room to the platform. As soon as he was well in the eye of the
      meeting, a single pair of hands&mdash;Daniel Dabbs owned them&mdash;gave
      the signal for uproar; feet made play on the boarding, and one or two of
      the more enthusiastic revolutionists fairly gave tongue. Richard seated
      himself with grave countenance, and surveyed the assembly; from fifty to
      sixty people were present, among them three or four women, and the number
      continued to grow. The chairman and one or two leading spirits had
      followed Mutimer to the place of distinction, where they talked with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Punctuality was not much regarded at these meetings; the lecture was
      announced for eight, but rarely began before half-past The present being
      an occasion of exceptional interest, twenty minutes past the hour saw the
      chairman rise for his prefatory remarks. He was a lank man of jovial
      countenance and jerky enunciation. There was no need, he observed, to
      introduce a friend and comrade so well known to them as the lecturer of
      the evening. &lsquo;We&rsquo;re always glad to hear him, and to-night, if I may be
      allowed to &lsquo;int as much, we&rsquo;re <i>particularly</i> glad to hear him. Our
      friend and comrade is going to talk to us about the Land. It&rsquo;s a question
      we can&rsquo;t talk or think too much about, and Comrade Mutimer has thought
      about it as much and more than any of us, I think I may say. I don&rsquo;t
      know,&rsquo; the chairman added, with a sly look across the room, &lsquo;whether our
      friend&rsquo;s got any new views on this subject of late. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if
      he had.&rsquo; Here sounded a roar of laughter, led off by Daniel Dabbs.
      &lsquo;Hows&rsquo;ever, be that as it may, we can answer for it as any views he may
      hold is the right views, and the honest views, and the views of a man as
      means to do a good deal more than talk about his convictions!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again did the stentor-note of Daniel ring forth, and it was amid
      thunderous cheering that Richard left his chair and moved to the front of
      the platform. His Sunday suit of black was still that with which his
      friends were familiar, but his manner, though the audience probably did
      not perceive the detail, was unmistakably hanged. He had been wont to
      begin his address with short, stinging periods, with sneers and such
      bitterness of irony as came within his compass. To-night he struck quite
      another key, mellow, confident, hinting at personal satisfaction; a smile
      was on his lips, and not a smile of scorn. He rested one hand against his
      side, holding in the other a scrap of paper with jotted items of
      reasoning. His head was thrown a little back; he viewed the benches from
      beneath his eyelids. True, the pose maintained itself but for a moment. I
      mention it because it was something new in Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke of the land; he attacked the old monopoly, and visioned a time
      when a claim to individual ownerships of the earth&rsquo;s surface would be as
      ludicrous as were now the assertion of title to a fee-simple somewhere in
      the moon. He mustered statistics; he adduced historic and contemporary
      example of the just and the unjust in land-holding; he gripped the throat
      of a certain English duke, and held him up for flagellation; he drifted
      into oceans of economic theory; he sat down by the waters of Babylon; he
      climbed Pisgah. Had he but spoken of backslidings in the wilderness! But
      for that fatal omission, the lecture was, of its kind, good. By degrees
      Richard forgot his pose and the carefully struck note of mellowness; he
      began to believe what he was saying, and to say it with the right vigour
      of popular oratory. Forget his struggles with the h-fiend; forget his
      syntactical lapses; you saw that after all the man had within him a clear
      flame of conscience; that he had felt before speaking that speech was one
      of the uses for which Nature had expressly framed him. His invective
      seldom degenerated into vulgar abuse; one discerned in him at least the
      elements of what we call good taste; of simple manliness he disclosed not
      a little; he had some command of pathos. In conclusion, he finished
      without reference to his personal concerns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chairman invited questions, preliminary to debate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose half-way down the room,&mdash;the man who invariably rises on
      these occasions. He was oldish, with bent shoulders, and wore spectacles&mdash;probably
      a clerk of forty years&rsquo; standing. In his hand was a small note-book, which
      he consulted. He began with measured utterance, emphatic, loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish to propose to the lecturer seven questions. I will read them in
      order; I have taken some pains to word them clearly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard has his scrap of paper on his knee. He jots a word or two after
      each deliberate interrogation, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other questioners succeeded. Richard replies to them. He fails to satisfy
      the man of seven queries, who, after repeating this and the other of the
      seven, professes himself still unsatisfied, shakes his head indulgently,
      walks from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The debate is opened. Behold a second inevitable man; he is not
      well-washed, his shirt-front shows a beer-stain; he is angry before he
      begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether a man as doesn&rsquo;t &lsquo;old with these kind o&rsquo; theories
      &lsquo;ll be allowed a fair &lsquo;earin&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Indignant interruption. Cries of &lsquo;Of course he will!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Who ever
      refused to hear you?&rsquo;&mdash;and the like.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is that singular phenomenon, that self-contradiction, that expression
      insoluble into factors of common-sense&mdash;the Conservative working man.
      What do they want to be at? he demands. Do they suppose as this kind of
      talk &lsquo;ll make wages higher, or enable the poor man to get his beef and
      beer at a lower rate? What&rsquo;s the d&mdash;d good of it all? Figures, oh? He
      never heered yet as figures made a meal for a man as hadn&rsquo;t got one; nor
      yet as they provided shoes and stockings for his young &lsquo;uns at &lsquo;ome. It
      made him mad to listen, that it did! Do they suppose as the rich man &lsquo;ll
      give up the land, if they talk till all&rsquo;s blue? Wasn&rsquo;t it human natur to
      get all you can and stick to it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pig&rsquo;s nature!&rsquo; cries someone from the front benches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; comes the rejoinder. &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say as there was no fair &lsquo;earing
      for a man as didn&rsquo;t say just what suits you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Daniel Dabbs is loud in good-tempered mockery. Mockery comes
      from every side, an angry note here and there, for the most part tolerant,
      jovial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let him speak! &lsquo;Ear him! Hoy! Hoy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The chairman interposes, but by the time that order is restored the
      Conservative working man has thrust his hat upon his head and is off to
      the nearest public-house, muttering oaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cullen rises, at the same time rises Mr. Cowes. These two gentlemen
      are fated to rise simultaneously. They scowl at each other. Mr. Cullen
      begins to speak, and Mr. Cowes, after a circular glance of protest,
      resumes his seat. The echoes tell that we are in for oratory with a
      vengeance. Mr. Cullen is a short, stout man, very seedily habited, with a
      great rough head of hair, an aquiline nose, lungs of vast power. His vein
      is King Cambyses&rsquo;; he tears passion to tatters; he roars leonine; he is
      your man to have at the pamper&rsquo;d jades of Asia! He has got hold of a new
      word, and that the verb to &lsquo;exploit.&rsquo; I am exploited, thou art exploited,&mdash;<i>he</i>
      exploits! Who? Why, such men as that English duke whom the lecturer
      gripped and flagellated. The English duke is Mr. Cullen&rsquo;s bugbear; never a
      speech from Mr. Cullen but that duke is most horribly mauled. His ground
      rents,&mdash;yah! Another word of which Mr. Cullen is fond is &lsquo;strattum,&rsquo;&mdash;usually
      spelt and pronounced with but one t midway. You and I have the misfortune
      to belong to a social &lsquo;strattum&rsquo; which is trampled flat and hard beneath
      the feet of the landowners. Mr. Cullen rises to such a point of fury that
      one dreads the consequences&mdash;to himself. Already the chairman is on
      his feet, intimating in dumb show that the allowed ten minutes have
      elapsed; there is no making the orator hear. At length his friend who sits
      by him fairly grips his coat-tails and brings him to a sitting posture,
      amid mirthful tumult. Mr. Cullen joins in the mirth, looks as though he
      had never been angry in his life. And till next Sunday comes round he will
      neither speak nor think of the social question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cowes is unopposed. After the preceding enthusiast, the voice of Mr.
      Cowes falls soothingly as a stream among the heather. He is tall, meagre,
      bald; he wears a very broad black necktie, his hand saws up and down. Mr.
      Cowes&rsquo; tone is the quietly venomous; in a few minutes you believe in his
      indignation far more than in that of Mr. Cullen. He makes a point and
      pauses to observe the effect upon his hearers. He prides himself upon his
      grammar, goes back to correct a concord, emphasises eccentricities of
      pronunciation; for instance, he accents &lsquo;capitalist&rsquo; on the second
      syllable, and repeats the words with grave challenge to all and sundry.
      Speaking of something which he wishes to stigmatise as a misnomer, he
      exclaims: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s what I call a misnomy!&rsquo; And he follows the assertion with
      an awful suspense of utterance. He brings his speech to a close exactly
      with the end of the tenth minute, and, on sitting down, eyes his unknown
      neighbour with wrathful intensity for several moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who will follow? A sound comes from the very back of the room, such a
      sound that every head turns in astonished search for the source of it.
      Such voice has the wind in garret-chimneys on a winter night. It is a thin
      wail, a prelude of lamentation; it troubles the blood. The speaker no one
      seems to know; he is a man of yellow visage, with head sunk between
      pointed shoulders, on his crown a mere scalp-lock. He seems to be
      afflicted with a disease of the muscles; his malformed body quivers, the
      hand he raises shakes paralytic. His clothes are of the meanest; what his
      age may be it is impossible to judge. As his voice gathers strength, the
      hearers begin to feel the influence of a terrible earnestness. He does not
      rant, he does not weigh his phrases; the stream of bitter prophecy flows
      on smooth and dark. He is supplying the omission in Mutimer&rsquo;s harangue, is
      bidding his class know itself and chasten itself, as an indispensable
      preliminary to any great change in the order of things. He cries vanity
      upon all these detailed schemes of social reconstruction. Are we ready for
      it? he wails. Could we bear it, if they granted it to us? It is all good
      and right, but hadn&rsquo;t we better first make ourselves worthy of such
      freedom? He begins a terrible arraignment of the People,&mdash;then, of a
      sudden, his voice has ceased. You could hear a pin drop. It is seen that
      the man has fallen to the ground; there arises a low moaning; people press
      about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They carry him into the coffee-shop. It was a fit. In five minutes he is
      restored, but does not come back to finish his speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an interval of disorder. But surely we are not going to let the
      meeting end in this way. The chairman calls for the next speaker, and he
      stands forth in the person of a rather smug little shopkeeper, who
      declares that he knows of no single particular in which the working class
      needs correction. The speech undeniably falls fiat. Will no one restore
      the tone of the meeting?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kitshaw is the man! Now we shall have broad grins. Mr. Kitshaw enjoys
      a reputation for mimicry; he takes off music-hall singers in the
      bar-parlour of a Saturday night. Observe, he rises, hems, pulls down his
      waistcoat; there is bubbling laughter. Mr. Kitshaw brings back the debate
      to its original subject; he talks of the Land. He is a little haphazard at
      first, but presently hits the mark in a fancy picture of a country still
      in the hands of aborigines, as yet unannexed by the capitalist nations,
      knowing not the meaning of the verb &lsquo;exploit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Imagine such a happy land, my friends; a land, I say, which nobody hasn&rsquo;t
      ever thought of &ldquo;developing the resources&rdquo; of,&mdash;that&rsquo;s the proper
      phrase, I believe. There are the people, with clothing enough for comfort
      and&mdash;ahem!&mdash;good manners, but, mark you, no more. No manufacture
      of luxurious skirts and hulsters and togs o&rsquo; that kind by the exploited
      classes. No, for no exploited classes don&rsquo;t exist! All are equal, my
      friends. Up an&rsquo; down the fields they goes, all day long, arm-in-arm, Jack
      and Jerry, aye, and Liza an&rsquo; Sairey Ann; for they have equality of the
      sexes, mind you! Up an&rsquo; down the fields, I say, in a devil-may-care sort
      of way, with their sweethearts and their wives. No factory smoke, dear no!
      There&rsquo;s the rivers, with tropical plants a-shading the banks, O my! There
      they goes up an&rsquo; down in their boats, devil-may-care, a-strumming on the
      banjo,&rsquo;&mdash;he imitated such action,&mdash;&lsquo;and a-singing their nigger
      minstrelsy with light &lsquo;earts. Why? &lsquo;Cause they ain&rsquo;t got no work to get up
      to at &lsquo;arf-past five next morning. Their time&rsquo;s their own! <i>That&rsquo;s</i>
      the condition of an unexploited country, my friends!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kitshaw had put everyone in vast good humour. You might wonder that
      his sweetly idyllic picture did not stir bitterness by contrast; it were
      to credit the English workman with too much imagination. Resonance of
      applause rewarded the sparkling rhetorician. A few of the audience availed
      themselves of the noise to withdraw, for the clock showed that it was
      close upon ten, and public-houses shut their doors early on Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Richard Mutimer was on his feet again, and this time without regard to
      effect; there was a word in him strongly demanding utterance. It was to
      the speech of the unfortunate prophet that he desired to reply. He began
      with sorrowful admissions. No one speaking honestly could deny that&mdash;that
      the working class had its faults; they came out plainly enough now and
      then. Drink, for instance (Mr. Cullen gave a resounding &lsquo;Hear, hear!&rsquo; and
      a stamp on the boards). What sort of a spectacle would be exhibited by the
      public-houses in Hoxton and Islington at closing time to-night? (&lsquo;True!&rsquo; 
      from Mr. Cowes, who also stamped on the boards.) Yes, but&mdash;Richard
      used the device of aposiopesis; Daniel Dabbs took it for a humorous effect
      and began a roar, which was summarily interdicted. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; pursued Richard
      with emphasis, &lsquo;what is the meaning of these vices? What do they come of?
      Who&rsquo;s to blame for them? Not the working class&mdash;never tell me! What
      drives a man to drink in his spare hours? What about the poisonous air of
      garrets and cellars? What about excessive toil and inability to procure
      healthy recreation? What about defects of education, due to poverty? What
      about diseased bodies inherited from over-slaved parents?&rsquo; Messrs. Cowes
      and Cullen had accompanied these queries with a climax of vociferous
      approval; when Richard paused, they led the tumult of hands and heels.
      &lsquo;Look at that poor man who spoke to us!&rsquo; cried Mutimer. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s gone, so I
      shan&rsquo;t hurt him by speaking plainly. He spoke well, mind you, and he spoke
      from his heart; but what sort of a life has his been, do you think? A
      wretched cripple, a miserable weakling no doubt from the day of his birth,
      cursed in having ever seen the daylight, and, such as he is, called upon
      to fight for his bread. Much of it he gets! Who would blame that man if he
      drank himself into unconsciousness every time he picked up a sixpence?&rsquo; 
      Cowes and Cullen bellowed their delight. &lsquo;Well, he doesn&rsquo;t do it; so much
      you can be sure of. In some vile hole here in this great city of ours he
      drags on a life worse&mdash;aye, a thousand times worse!&mdash;than that
      of the horses in the West-end mews. Don&rsquo;t clap your hands so much,
      fellow-workers. Just think about it on your way home; talk about it to
      your wives and your children. It&rsquo;s the sight of objects like that that
      makes my blood boil, and that&rsquo;s set me in earnest at this work of ours. I
      feel for that man and all like him as if they were my brothers. And I take
      you all to witness, all you present and all you repeat my words to, that
      I&rsquo;ll work on as long as I have life in me, that I&rsquo;ll use every opportunity
      that&rsquo;s given me to uphold the cause of the poor and down-trodden against
      the rich and selfish and luxurious, that if I live another fifty years I
      shall still be of the people and with the people, that no man shall ever
      have it in his power to say that Richard Mutimer misused his chances and
      was only a new burden to them whose load he might have lightened!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing for it but to leap on to the very benches and yell as
      long as your voice would hold out.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that the meeting was mere exuberance of mutual congratulations. Mr.
      Cullen was understood to be moving the usual vote of thanks, but even his
      vocal organs strove hard for little purpose. Daniel Dabbs had never made a
      speech in his life, but excitement drove him on the honourable post of
      seconder. The chairman endeavoured to make certain announcements; then the
      assembly broke up. The estrade was invaded; everybody wished to shake
      hands with Mutimer. Mr. Cullen tried to obtain Richard&rsquo;s attention to
      certain remarks of value; failing, he went off with a scowl. Mr. Cowes
      attempted to button-hole the popular hero; finding Richard conversing with
      someone else at the same time, he turned away with a covert sneer. The
      former of the two worthies had desired to insist upon every member of the
      Union becoming a teetotaller; the latter wished to say that he thought it
      would be well if a badge of temperance were henceforth worn by Unionists.
      On turning away, each glanced at the clock and hurried his step.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a certain dark street not very far from the lecture-room Mr. Cullen
      rose on tip-toe at the windows of a dull little public-house. A Unionist
      was standing at the bar; Mr. Cullen hurried on, into a street yet darker.
      Again he tip-toed at a window. The glimpse reassured him; he passed
      quickly through the doorway, stepped to the bar, gave an order. Then he
      turned, and behold, on a seat just under the window sat Mr. Cowes, &amp;
      short pipe in his mouth, a smoking tumbler held on his knee. The
      supporters of total abstinence nodded to each other, with a slight lack of
      spontaneity. Mr. Cullen, having secured his own tumbler, came by his
      comrade&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Deal o&rsquo; fine talk to wind up with,&rsquo; he remarked tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He means what he says,&rsquo; returned the other gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes,&rsquo; Mr. Cullen hastened to admit. &lsquo;Mutimer means what he says! Only
      the way of saying it, I meant&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a bit of a sore throat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So have I. After that there hot room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They nodded at each other sympathetically. Mr. Cullen filled a little
      black pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Got alight?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cowes offered the glowing bowl of his own clay; they put their noses
      together and blew a cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course there&rsquo;s no saying what time &lsquo;ll do,&rsquo; observed tall Mr. Cowes,
      sententiously, after a gulp of warm liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No more there is,&rsquo; assented short Mr. Cullen with half a wink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s easy to promise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As easy as tellin&rsquo; lies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Another silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose you and me &lsquo;ll get much of it,&rsquo; Mr. Cowes ventured to
      observe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About as much as you can put in your eye without winkin&rsquo;,&rsquo; was the
      other&rsquo;s picturesque agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked till closing time.

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      One morning late in June, Hubert Eldon passed through the gates of Wanley
      Manor and walked towards the village. It was the first time since his
      illness that he had left the grounds on foot. He was very thin, and had an
      absent, troubled look; the natural cheerfulness of youth&rsquo;s convalescence
      seemed altogether lacking in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a rising point of the road, winding between the Manor and Wanley, a
      good view of the valley offered itself; here Hubert paused, leaning a
      little on his stick, and let his eyes dwell upon the prospect. A year ago
      he had stood here and enjoyed the sweep of meadows between Stanbury Hill
      and the wooded slope opposite, the orchard-patches, the flocks along the
      margin of the little river. To-day he viewed a very different scene.
      Building of various kinds was in progress in the heart of the vale; a
      great massive chimney was rising to completion, and about it stood a
      number of sheds. Beyond was to be seen the commencement of a street of
      small houses, promising infinite ugliness in a little space; the soil over
      a considerable area was torn up and trodden into mud. A number of men were
      at work; carts and waggons and trucks were moving about. In truth, the
      benighted valley was waking up and donning the true nineteenth-century
      livery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s face, hitherto thoughtfully sad, changed to an expression
      of bitterness; he muttered what seemed to be angry and contemptuous words,
      then averted his eyes and walked on. He entered the village street and
      passed along it for some distance, his fixed gaze appearing studiously to
      avoid the people who stood about or walked by him. There was a spot of
      warm colour on his cheeks; he held himself very upright and had a
      painfully self-conscious air.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped before a dwelling-house, rang the bell, and made inquiry
      whether Mr. Mutimer was at home. The reply being affirmative, he followed
      the servant up to the first floor. His name was announced at the door of a
      sitting-room, and he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two men were conversing in the room. One sat at the table with a sheet of
      paper before him, sketching a rough diagram and scribbling notes; this was
      Richard Mutimer. He was dressed in a light tweed suit; his fair moustache
      and beard were trimmed, and the hand which rested on the table was no
      longer that of a daily-grimed mechanic. His linen was admirably starched;
      altogether he had a very fresh and cool appearance. His companion was
      astride on a chair, his arms resting on the back, a pipe in his mouth.
      This man was somewhat older than Mutimer; his countenance indicated
      shrewdness and knowledge of the world. He was dark and well-featured, his
      glossy black hair was parted in the middle, his moustache of the cut
      called imperial, his beard short and peaked. He wore a canvas jacket, a
      white waistcoat and knickerbockers; at his throat a blue necktie fluttered
      loose. When Hubert&rsquo;s name was announced by the servant, this gentleman
      stopped midway in a sentence, took his pipe from his lips, and looked to
      the door with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer rose and addressed his visitor easily indeed, but not
      discourteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you do, Mr. Eldon? I&rsquo;m glad to see that you are so much better.
      Will you sit down? I think you know Mr. Rodman, at all events by name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert assented by gesture. He had come prepared for disagreeable things
      in this his first meeting with Mutimer, but the honour of an introduction
      to the latter&rsquo;s friends had not been included in his anticipations. Mr.
      Rodman had risen and bowed slightly. His smile carried a disagreeable
      suggestion from which Mutimer&rsquo;s behaviour was altogether free; he rather
      seemed to enjoy the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment there was silence and embarrassment. Richard overcame the
      difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come and dine with me to-night, will you?&rsquo; he said to Rodman. &lsquo;Here, take
      this plan with you, and think it over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray don&rsquo;t let me interfere with your business,&rsquo; interposed Hubert, with
      scrupulous politeness. &lsquo;I could see you later, Mr. Mutimer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; Rodman and I have done for the present,&rsquo; said Mutimer,
      cheerfully. &lsquo;By-the-by,&rsquo; he added, as his right-hand man moved to the
      door, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t forget to drop a line to Slater and Smith. And, I say, if
      Hogg turns up before two o&rsquo;clock, send him here; I&rsquo;ll be down with you by
      half-past.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rodman gave an &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; nodded to Hubert, who paid no attention,
      and took his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve had a long pull of it,&rsquo; Richard began, as he took his chair again,
      and threw his legs into an easy position. &lsquo;Shall I close the windows?
      Maybe you don&rsquo;t like the draught.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you; I feel no draught.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The working man had the advantage as yet. Hubert in vain tried to be at
      ease, whilst Mutimer was quite himself, and not ungraceful in his
      assumption of equality. For one thing, Hubert could not avoid a comparison
      between his own wasted frame and the other&rsquo;s splendid physique; it
      heightened the feeling of antagonism which possessed him in advance, and
      provoked the haughtiness he had resolved to guard against. The very
      lineaments of the men foretold mutual antipathy. Hubert&rsquo;s extreme delicacy
      of feature was the outward expression of a character so compact of
      subtleties and refinements, of high prejudice and jealous sensibility, of
      spiritual egoism and all-pervading fastidiousness, that it was impossible
      for him not to regard with repugnance a man who represented the combative
      principle, even the triumph, of the uncultured classes. He was no
      hidebound aristocrat; the liberal tendencies of his intellect led him to
      scorn the pageantry of long-descended fools as strongly as he did the
      blind image-breaking of the mob; but in a case of personal relations
      temperament carried it over judgment in a very high-handed way. Youth and
      disappointment weighed in the scale of unreason. Mutimer, on the other
      hand, though fortune helped him to forbearance, saw, or believed he saw,
      the very essence of all he most hated in this proud-eyed representative of
      a county family. His own rough-sculptured comeliness corresponded to the
      vigour and practicality and zeal of a nature which cared nothing for form
      and all for substance; the essentials of life were to him the only things
      in life, instead of, as to Hubert Eldon, the mere brute foundation of an
      artistic super structure. Richard read clearly enough the sentiments with
      which his visitor approached him; who that is the object of contempt does
      not readily perceive it? His way of revenging himself was to emphasise a
      tone of good fellowship, to make it evident how well he could afford to
      neglect privileged insolence. In his heart he triumphed over the
      disinherited aristocrat; outwardly he was civil, even friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert had made this call with a special purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am charged by Mrs. Eldon,&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;to thank you for the courtesy you
      have shown her during my illness. My own thanks likewise I hope you will
      accept. We have caused you, I fear, much inconvenience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard found himself envying the form and tone of this deliverance; he
      gathered his beard in his hands and gave it a tug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit of it,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;I am very comfortable here. A bedroom and
      a place for work, that&rsquo;s about all I want.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert barely smiled. He wondered whether the mention of work was meant to
      suggest comparisons. He hastened to add&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On Monday we hope to leave the Manor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No need whatever for hurry,&rsquo; observed Mutimer, good-humouredly. &lsquo;Please
      tell Mrs. Eldon that I hope she will take her own time.&rsquo; On reflection
      this seemed rather an ill-chosen phrase; he bettered it. &lsquo;I should be very
      sorry if she inconvenienced herself on my account.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Confound the fellow&rsquo;s impudence!&rsquo; was Hubert&rsquo;s mental comment. &lsquo;He plays
      the forbearing landlord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His spoken reply was: &lsquo;It is very kind of you. I foresee no difficulty in
      completing the removal on Monday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In view of Mutimer&rsquo;s self-command, Hubert began to be aware that his own
      constraint might carry the air of petty resentment Fear of that drove him
      upon a topic he would rather have left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are changing the appearance of the valley,&rsquo; he said, veiling by his
      tone the irony which was evident in his choice of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard glanced at him, then walked to the window, with his hands in his
      pockets, and gave himself the pleasure of a glimpse of the furnace-chimney
      above the opposite houses. He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope to change it a good deal more. In a year or two you won&rsquo;t know the
      place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer glanced again at his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you fear?&rsquo; he asked, with less command of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I of course understand your point of view. Personally, I prefer nature.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert endeavoured to smile, that his personal preferences might lose
      something of their edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You prefer nature,&rsquo; Mutimer repeated, coming back to his chair, on the
      seat of which he rested a foot. &lsquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t say that I do. The Wanley
      Iron Works will soon mean bread to several hundred families; how many
      would the grass support?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure,&rsquo; assented Hubert, still smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are aware,&rsquo; Mutimer proceeded to ask, &lsquo;that this is not a speculation
      for my own profit?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have heard something of your scheme. I trust it will be appreciated.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say it will be&mdash;by those who care anything about the welfare
      of the people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldon rose; he could not trust himself to continue the dialogue. He had
      expected to meet a man of coarser grain; Mutimer&rsquo;s intelligence made
      impossible the civil condescension which would have served with a boor,
      and Hubert found the temptation to pointed utterance all the stronger for
      the dangers it involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will drop you a note,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to let you know as soon as the house
      is empty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not shaken hands at meeting, nor did they now. Each felt relieved
      when out of the other&rsquo;s sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert turned out of the street into a road which would lead him to the
      church, whence there was a field-path back to the Manor. Walking with his
      eyes on the ground he did not perceive the tall, dark figure that
      approached him as he drew near to the churchyard gate. Mr. Wyvern had been
      conducting a burial; he had just left the vestry and was on his way to the
      vicarage, which stood five minutes&rsquo; walk from the church. Himself
      unperceived, he scrutinised the young man until he stood face to face with
      him; his deep-voiced greeting caused Hubert to look up&rsquo; with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to see you walking,&rsquo; said the clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took Hubert&rsquo;s hand and held it paternally in both his own. Eldon seemed
      affected with a sudden surprise; as he met the large gaze his look showed
      embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You remember me?&rsquo; Mr. Wyvern remarked, his wonted solemnity lightened by
      the gleam of a brief smile. Looking closely into his face was like
      examining a map in relief; you saw heights and plains, the intersection of
      multitudinous valleys, river-courses with their tributaries. It was the
      visage of a man of thought and character. His eyes spoke of late hours and
      the lamp; beneath each was a heavy pocket of skin, wrinkling at its
      juncture with the cheek. His teeth were those of an incessant smoker, and,
      in truth, you could seldom come near him without detecting the odour of
      tobacco. Despite the amplitude of his proportions, there was nothing
      ponderous about him; the great head was finely formed, and his limbs must
      at one time have been as graceful as they were muscular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is this accident,&rsquo; Hubert asked; &lsquo;or did you know me at the time?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Accident, pure accident. Will you walk to the vicarage with me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They paced side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Eldon profits by the pleasant weather, I trust?&rsquo; the vicar observed,
      with grave courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, I think she does. I shall be glad when she is settled in her
      new home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They approached the door of the vicarage in silence. Entering Mr. Wyvern
      led the way to his study. When he had taken a seat, he appeared to forget
      himself for a moment, and played with the end of his bean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert showed impatient curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You found me there by chance that morning?&rsquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman returned to the present. His elbows on either arm of his
      round chair, he sat leaning forward, thoughtfully gazing at his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By chance,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;I sleep badly; so it happened that I was abroad
      shortly after daybreak. I was near the edge of the wood when I heard a
      pistol-shot. I waited for the second.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We fired together,&rsquo; Hubert remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! It seemed to me one report. Well, as I stood listening, there came
      out from among the trees a man who seemed in a hurry. He was startled at
      finding himself face to face with me, but didn&rsquo;t stop; he said something
      rapidly in French that I failed to catch, pointed back into the wood, and
      hastened off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We had no witnesses,&rsquo; put in Hubert; &lsquo;and both aimed our best. I wonder
      he sent you to look for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A momentary weakness, no doubt,&rsquo; rejoined the vicar drily. I made my way
      among the trees and found you lying there, unconscious. I made some
      attempt to stop the blood-flow, then picked you up; it seemed better, on
      the whole, than leaving you on the wet grass an indefinite time. Your
      overcoat was on the ground; as I took hold of it, two letters fell from
      the pocket. I made no scruple about reading the addresses, and was
      astonished to find that one was to Mrs. Eldon, at Wanley Manor, Wanley
      being the place where I was about to live on my return to England. I took
      it for granted that you were Mrs. Eldon&rsquo;s son. The other letter, as you
      know, was to a lady at a hotel in the town.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you went to her as soon as you left me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After hearing from the doctor that there was no immediate danger.&mdash;The
      letters, I suppose, would have announced your death?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert again inclined his head. The imperturbable gravity of the speaker
      had the effect of imposing self-command on the young man; whose sensitive
      cheeks showed what was going on within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you tell me of your interview with her?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was of the briefest; my French is not fluent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But she speaks English well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Probably her distress led her to give preference to her native tongue.
      She was anxious to go to you immediately, and I told her where you lay. I
      made inquiries next day, and found that she was still giving you her care.
      As you were doing well, and I had to be moving homewards, I thought it
      better to leave without seeing you again. The innkeeper had directions to
      telegraph to me if there was a change for the worse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My pocket-book saved me,&rsquo; remarked Hubert, touching his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvern drew in his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Came between that ready-stamped letter and Wanley Manor,&rsquo; was his
      comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a brief silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You allow me a question?&rsquo; the vicar resumed. &lsquo;It is with reference to the
      French lady.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you have every right to question me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no! It does not concern the events prior to your&mdash;accident.&rsquo; Mr.
      Wyvern savoured the word. &lsquo;How long did she remain in attendance upon
      you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A short time&mdash;two day&mdash;I did not need&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvern motioned with his hand, kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I was not mistaken,&rsquo; he said, averting his eyes for the first time,
      &lsquo;in thinking that I saw her in Paris.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In Paris?&rsquo; Hubert repeated, with a poor affectation of indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I made a short stay before crossing. I had business at a bank one day; as
      I stood before the counter a gentleman entered and took a place beside me.
      A second look assured me that he was the man who met me at the edge of the
      wood that morning. I suppose he remembered me, for he looked away and
      moved from me. I left the bank, and found an open carriage waiting at the
      door. In it sat the lady of whom we speak. I took a turn along the
      pavement and back again. The Frenchman entered the carriage; they drove
      away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert&rsquo;s eyes were veiled; he breathed through his nostrils. Again there
      was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Eldon,&rsquo; resumed the vicar, &lsquo;I was a man of the world before I became
      a Churchman; you will notice that I affect no professional tone in
      speaking with you, and it is because I know that anything of the kind
      would only alienate you. It appeared to me that chance had made me aware
      of something it might concern you to hear. I know nothing of the
      circumstances of the case, merely offer you the facts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thank you,&rsquo; was Hubert&rsquo;s reply in an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It impressed me, that letter ready stamped for Wanley Manor. I thought of
      it again after the meeting in Paris.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I understand you. Of course I could explain the necessity. It would be
      useless.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite. But experience is not, or should not be, useless, especially when
      commented on by one who has very much of it behind him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert stood up. His mind was in a feverishly active state, seeming to
      follow several lines of thought simultaneously. Among other things, he was
      wondering how it was that throughout this conversation he had been so
      entirely passive. He had never found himself under the influence of so
      strong a personality, exerted too in such a strangely quiet way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are your plans&mdash;your own plans?&rsquo; Mr. Wyvern inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have none.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Forgive me;&mdash;there will be no material difficulties?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None; I have four hundred a year.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have not graduated yet, I believe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. But I hardly think I can go back to school.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps not. Well, turn things over. I should like to hear from you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert continued his walk to the Manor. Before the entrance stood two
      large furniture-vans; the doorway was littered with materials of packing,
      and the hall was full of objects in disorder, footsteps made a hollow
      resonance in all parts of the house, for everywhere the long wonted
      conditions of sound were disturbed. The library was already dismantled;
      here he could close the door and walk about without fear of intrusion. He
      would have preferred to remain in the open air, but a summer shower had
      just begun as he reached the house. He could not sit still; the bare floor
      of the large room met his needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind&rsquo;s eye pictured a face which a few months ago had power to lead
      him whither it willed, which had in fact led him through strange scenes,
      as far from the beaten road of a college curriculum as well could be. It
      was a face of foreign type, Jewish possibly, most unlike that ideal of
      womanly charm kept in view by one who seeks peace and the heart&rsquo;s home.
      Hubert had entertained no thought of either. The romance which most young
      men are content to enjoy in printed pages he had acted out in his life. He
      had lived through a glorious madness, as unlike the vulgar oat-sowing of
      the average young man of wealth as the latest valse on a street-organ is
      unlike a passionate dream of Chopin. However unworthy the object of his
      frenzy&mdash;and perhaps one were as worthy as another&mdash;the pursuit
      had borne him through an atmosphere of fire, tempering him for life,
      marking him for ever from plodders of the dusty highway. A reckless
      passion is a patent of nobility. Whatever existence had in store for him
      henceforth, Hubert could feel that he had lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour&rsquo;s communing with memory was brought to an end by the ringing of
      the luncheon-bell. Since his illness Hubert had taken meals with his
      mother in her own sitting-room. Thither he now repaired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eldon had grown older in appearance since that evening of her son&rsquo;s
      return. Of course she had discovered the cause of his illness, and the
      incessant torment of a great fear had been added to what she suffered from
      the estrangement between the boy and herself. Her own bodily weakness had
      not permitted her to nurse him; she had passed days and nights in anguish
      of expectancy. At one time it had been life or death. If he died, what
      life would be hers through the brief delay to which she could look
      forward?
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more she had him by her side, but the moral distance between them was
      nothing lessened. Mrs. Eldon&rsquo;s pride would not allow her to resume the
      conversation which had ended so hopelessly for her, and she interpreted
      Hubert&rsquo;s silence in the saddest sense. Now they were about to be parted
      again. A house had been taken for her at Agworth, three miles away; in her
      state of health she could not quit the neighbourhood of the few old
      friends whom she still saw. But Hubert would necessarily go into the world
      to seek some kind of career. No hope shone for her in the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst the servant waited on them at luncheon, mother and son exchanged
      few words. Afterwards, Mrs. Eldon had her chair moved to the window, where
      she could see the garden greenery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I called on Mr. Mutimer,&rsquo; Hubert said, standing near her. Through the
      meal he had cast frequent glances at her pale, nobly-lined countenance, as
      if something had led him to occupy his thoughts with her. He looked at her
      in the same way now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you? How did he impress you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is not quite the man I had expected; more civilised. I should suppose
      he is the better kind of artisan. He talks with a good deal of the
      working-class accent, of course, but not like a wholly uneducated man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His letter, you remember, was anything but illiterate. I feel I ought to
      ask him to come and see me before we leave.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The correspondence surely suffices.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You expressed my thanks?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Conscientiously.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see you found the interview rather difficult, Hubert.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How could it be otherwise? The man is well enough, of his kind, but the
      kind is detestable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did he try to convert you to Socialism?&rsquo; asked his mother, smiling in her
      sad way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I imagine he discerned the hopelessness of such an under taking. We had a
      little passage of arms,&mdash;quite within the bounds of civility. Shall I
      tell you how I felt in talking with him? I seemed to be holding a dialogue
      with the twentieth century, and you may think what that means.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s a long way off, Hubert.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish it were farther. The man was openly exultant; he stood for Demos
      grasping the sceptre. I am glad, mother, that you leave Wanley before the
      air is poisoned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Mutimer does not see that side of the question?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not he! Do you imagine the twentieth century will leave one green spot on
      the earth&rsquo;s surface?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, it will always be necessary to grow grass and corn.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By no means; depend upon it. Such things will be cultivated by chemical
      processes. There will not be one inch left to nature; the very oceans will
      somehow be tamed, the snow-mountains will be levelled. And with nature
      will perish art. What has a hungry Demos to do with the beautiful?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eldon sighed gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall not see it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes dreamed upon the soft-swaying boughs of a young chestnut. Hubert
      was watching her face; its look and the meaning implied in her words
      touched him profoundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother!&rsquo; he said under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew nearer to her and just stroked with his fingers the silver lines
      which marked the hair on either side of her brows. He could see that she
      trembled and that her lips set themselves in hard self-conquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you wish me to do when we have left the Manor?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His own voice was hurried between two quiverings of the throat; his
      mother&rsquo;s only whispered in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is for your own consideration, Hubert.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With your counsel, mother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My counsel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ask it I will follow it. I wish to be guided by you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He knelt by her, and his mother pressed his head against her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, she asked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you call also on the Walthams?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Should you not do so, dear?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think that must be later.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject was not pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day was Saturday. In the afternoon Hubert took a walk which had
      been his favourite one ever since he could remember, every step of the way
      associated with recollections of childhood, boyhood, or youth. It was
      along the lane which began in a farmyard close by the Manor and climbed
      with many turnings to the top of Stanbury Hill. This was ever the first
      route re-examined by his brother Godfrey and himself on their return from
      school at holiday-time. It was a rare region for bird-nesting, so seldom
      was it trodden save by a few farm-labourers at early morning or when the
      day&rsquo;s work was over. Hubert passed with a glance of recognition the
      bramble in which he had found his first spink&rsquo;s nest, the shadowed mossy
      bank whence had fluttered the hapless wren just when the approach of two
      prowling youngsters should have bidden her keep close. Boys on the
      egg-trail are not wont to pay much attention to the features of the
      country; but Hubert remembered that at a certain meadow-gate he had always
      rested for a moment to view the valley, some mute presage of things
      unimagined stirring at his heart. Was it even then nineteenth century? Not
      for him, seeing that the life of each of us reproduces the successive ages
      of the world. Belwick, roaring a few miles away, was but an isolated black
      patch on the earth&rsquo;s beauty, not, as he now understood it, a malignant
      cancer-spot, spreading day by day, corrupting, an augury of death. In
      those days it had seemed fast in the order of things that Wanley Manor
      should be his home through life; how otherwise? Was it not the
      abiding-place of the Eldons from of old? Who had ever hinted at
      revolution? He knew now that revolution had been at work from an earlier
      time than that; whilst he played and rambled with his brother the
      framework of their life was crumbling about them. Belwick was already
      throwing a shadow upon Wanley. And now behold! he stood at the old gate,
      rested his hands where they had been wont to rest, turned his eyes in the
      familiar direction; no longer a mere shadow, there was Belwick itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart was hot with outraged affection, with injured pride. On the
      scarcely closed grave of that passion which had flamed through so brief a
      life sprang up the flower of natural tenderness, infinitely sweet and
      precious. For the first time he was fully conscious of what it meant to
      quit Wanley for ever; the past revealed itself to him, lovelier and more
      loved because parted from him by so hopeless a gulf. Hubert was not old
      enough to rate experience at its true value, to acquiesce in the law which
      wills that the day must perish before we can enjoy to the full its light
      and odour. He could only feel his loss, and rebel against the fate which
      had ordained it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had climbed but half-way up the hill; from this point onwards there was
      no view till the summit was reached, for the lane proceeded between high
      banks and hedges. To gain the very highest point he had presently to quit
      the road by a stile and skirt the edge of a small rising meadow, at the
      top of which was an old cow-house with a few trees growing about it.
      Thence one had the finest prospect in the county.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the stone shed, looked back for a moment over Wanley, then
      walked round to the other side. As he turned the corner of the building
      his eye was startled by the unexpected gleam of a white dress. A girl
      stood there; she was viewing the landscape through a field-glass, and thus
      remained unaware of his approach on the grass. He stayed his step and
      observed her with eyes of recognition. Her attitude, both hands raised to
      hold the glass, displayed to perfection the virginal outline of her
      white-robed form. She wore a straw hat of the plain masculine fashion; her
      brown hair was plaited in a great circle behind her head, not one tendril
      loosed from the mass; a white collar closely circled her neck; her waist
      was bound with a red girdle. All was grace and purity; the very folds
      towards the bottom of her dress hung in sculpturesque smoothness; the form
      of her half-seen foot bowed the herbage with lightest pressure. From the
      boughs above there fell upon her a dancing network of shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert only half smiled; he stood with his hands joined behind him, his
      eyes fixed upon her face, waiting for her to turn But several moments
      passed and she was still intent on the landscape. He spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you let me look?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hands fell, all but dropping the glass; still, she did not start with
      unbecoming shrug as most people do, the instinctive movement of guarding
      against a stroke; the falling of her arms was the only abrupt motion, her
      head turning in the direction of the speaker with a grace as spontaneous
      as that we see in a fawn that glances back before flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Mr. Eldon! How silently you have come!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The wild rose of her cheeks made rivalry for an instant with the richer
      garden blooms, and the subsiding warmth left a pearly translucency as of a
      lily petal against the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held her hand to him, delicately gloved, warm; the whole of it was
      hidden within Hubert&rsquo;s clasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What were you looking at so attentively?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At Agworth station,&rsquo; replied Adela, turning her eyes again in that
      quarter. &lsquo;My brother&rsquo;s train ought to be in by now, I think. He comes home
      every Saturday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert spoke without thought, his look resting upon the maiden&rsquo;s red
      girdle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad that you are well again,&rsquo; Adela said with natural kindness.
      &lsquo;You have had a long illness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; it has been a tiresome affair. Is Mrs. Waltham well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite, thank you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And your brother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alfred never had anything the matter with him in his life, I believe,&rsquo; 
      she answered, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fortunate fellow! Will you lend me the glass?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She held it to him, and at the same moment her straying eye caught a
      glimpse of white smoke, far off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There comes the train!&rsquo; she exclaimed. &lsquo;You will be able to see it
      between these two hills.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert looked and returned the glass to her, but she did not make use of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does he walk over from Agworth?&rsquo; was Hubert&rsquo;s next question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. It does him good after a week of Belwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There will soon be little difference between Belwick and Wanley,&rsquo; 
      rejoined Hubert, drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela glanced at him; there was sympathy and sorrow in the look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knew it would grieve you,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what is your own feeling? Do you rejoice in the change as a sign of
      progress?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, no. I am very, very sorry to have our beautiful valley so spoilt.
      It is only&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert eyed her with sudden sharpness of scrutiny; the look seemed to
      check her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only what?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;You find compensations?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My brother won&rsquo;t hear of such regrets,&rsquo; she continued with a little
      embarrassment &lsquo;He insists on the good that will be done by the change.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From such a proprietor as I should have been to a man of Mr. Mutimer&rsquo;s
      activity. To be sure, that is one point of view.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is not my meaning, Mr. Eldon, as you know. I was speaking of the
      change without regard to who brings it about. And I was not giving my own
      opinion; Alfred&rsquo;s is always on the side of the working people; he seems to
      forget everybody else in his zeal for their interests. And then, the works
      are going to be quite a new kind of undertaking. You have heard of Mr.
      Mutimer&rsquo;s plans of course?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have an idea of them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think them mistaken?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. I would rather say they don&rsquo;t interest me. That seems to disappoint
      you, Miss Waltham. Probably you are interested in them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of her own name thus formally interjected, Adela just raised
      her eyes from their reflective gaze on the near landscape; then she became
      yet more thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I think I am,&rsquo; she replied, with deliberation. &lsquo;The principle seems
      a just one. Devotion to a really unselfish cause is rare, I am afraid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have met Mr. Mutimer?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Once. My brother made his acquaintance, and he called on us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did he explain his scheme to you in detail?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not himself. Alfred has told me all about it. He, of course, is delighted
      with it; he has joined what he calls the Union.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you going to join?&rsquo; Hubert asked, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I? I doubt whether they would have me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed silverly, her throat tremulous, like that of a bird that
      sings. How significant the laugh was! the music of how pure a freshet of
      life!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All the members, I presume,&rsquo; said Hubert, &lsquo;are to be speedily enriched
      from the Wanley Mines and Iron Works?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was jokingly uttered, but Adela replied with some earnestness, as if to
      remove a false impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that is quite a mistake. Mr. Eldon. There is no question of anyone
      being enriched, least of all Mr. Mutimer himself. The workmen will receive
      just payment, not mere starvation wages, but whatever profit there is will
      be devoted to the propaganda.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Propaganda! Starvation wages! Ah, I see you have gone deeply into these
      matters. How strangely that word sounds on your lips&mdash;propaganda!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela reddened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why strangely, Mr. Eldon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One associates it with such very different speakers; it has such a
      terrible canting sound. I hope you will not get into the habit of using it&mdash;for
      your own sake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not likely to use it much. I suppose I have heard it so often from
      Alfred lately. Please don&rsquo;t think,&rsquo; she added rather hastily, &lsquo;that I have
      become a Socialist. Indeed, I dislike the name; I find it implies so many
      things that I could never approve of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her way of speaking the last sentence would have amused a dispassionate
      critic, it was so distinctively the tone of Puritan maidenhood. From lips
      like Adela&rsquo;s it is delicious to hear such moral babbling. Oh, the gravity
      of conviction in a white-souled English girl of eighteen! Do you not hear
      her say those words: &lsquo;things that I could never approve of&rsquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      As her companion did not immediately reply, she again raised the
      field-glass to her eyes and swept the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you see your brother on the road?&rsquo; Hubert inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, not yet. There is a trap driving this way. Why, Alfred sitting in it!
      Oh, it is Mr. Mutimer&rsquo;s trap I see. He must have met Alfred at the station
      and have given him a ride.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Evidently they are great friends,&rsquo; commented Eldon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela did not reply. After gazing a little longer, she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He will be home before I can get there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She screwed up the glasses and turned as if to take leave. But Hubert
      prepared to walk by her side, and together they reached the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now I am going to run down the hill,&rsquo; Adela said, laughing. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t ask
      you to join in such childishness, and I suppose you are not going this
      way, either?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I am walking back to the Manor,&rsquo; the other replied soberly. &lsquo;We had
      better say good-bye. On Monday we shall leave Wanley, my mother and I.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On Monday?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl became graver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But only to go to Agworth?&rsquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall not remain at Agworth. I am going to London.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To&mdash;to study?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something or other, I don&rsquo;t quite know what. Good-bye!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you come to say good-bye to us&mdash;to mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall you be at home to-morrow afternoon, about four o&rsquo;clock say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes; the very time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I will come to say good-bye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In that case we needn&rsquo;t say it now, need we? It is only good afternoon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to walk down the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought you were going to run,&rsquo; cried Hubert.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked back, and her silver laugh made chorus with the joyous refrain
      of a yellow-hammer, piping behind the hedge. Till the turn of the road she
      continued walking, then Hubert had a glimpse of white folds waving in the
      act of flight, and she was beyond his vision.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Adela reached the house door at the very moment that Mutimer&rsquo;s trap drove
      up. She had run nearly all the way down the hill, and her soberer pace
      during the last ten minutes had not quite reduced the flush in her cheeks.
      Mutimer raised his hat with much <i>aplomb</i> before he had pulled up his
      horse, and his look stayed on her whilst Alfred Waltham was descending and
      taking leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was lucky enough to overtake your brother in Agworth,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, you have deprived him of what he calls his constitutional,&rsquo; laughed
      Adela.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have I? Well, it isn&rsquo;t often I&rsquo;m here over Saturday, so he can generally
      feel safe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The hat was again aired, and Richard drove away to the Wheatsheaf Inn,
      where he kept his horse at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother and sister went together into the parlour, where Mrs. Waltham
      immediately joined them, having descended from an upper room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So Mr. Mutimer drove you home!&rsquo; she exclaimed, with the interest which
      provincial ladies, lacking scope for their energies, will display in very
      small incidents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. By the way, I&rsquo;ve asked him to come and have dinner with us
      to-morrow. He hadn&rsquo;t any special reason for going to town, and was
      uncertain whether to do so or not, so I thought I might as well have him
      here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Alfred always spoke in a somewhat emphatic first person singular when
      domestic arrangements were under, discussion; occasionally the habit led
      to a passing unpleasantness of tone between himself and Mrs. Waltham. In
      the present instance, however, nothing of the kind was to be feared; his
      mother smiled very graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad you thought of it,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;It would have been very lonely
      for him in his lodgings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither of the two happened to be regarding Adela, or they would have seen
      a look of dismay flit across her countenance and pass into one of
      annoyance. When the talk had gone on for a few minutes Adela interposed a
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will Mr. Mutimer stay for tea also, do you think, Alfred?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, of course; why shouldn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the country habit; Adela might have known what answer she would
      receive. She got out of the difficulty by means of a little
      disingenuousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t want us to talk about Socialism all the time, will he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course not, my dear,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Waltham. &lsquo;Why, it will be Sunday.&rsquo; 
      4
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred shouted in mirthful scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s one of the finest things I&rsquo;ve heard for a long time, mother!
      It&rsquo;ll be Sunday, and <i>therefore</i> we are not to talk about improving
      the lot of the human race. Ye gods!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham was puzzled for an instant, but the Puritan assurance did not
      fail her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but that is only improvement of their bodies, Alfred&mdash;food and
      clothing. The six days are for that you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother, mother, you will kill me! You are so uncommonly funny! I wonder
      your friends haven&rsquo;t long ago found some way of doing without bodies
      altogether. Now, I pray you, do not talk nonsense. Surely <i>that</i> is
      forbidden on the Sabbath, if only the Jewish one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother is quite right, Alfred,&rsquo; remarked Adela, with quiet
      affimativeness, as soon as her voice could be heard. &lsquo;Your Socialism is
      earthly; we have to think of other things besides bodily comforts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who said we hadn&rsquo;t?&rsquo; cried her brother. &lsquo;But I take leave to inform you
      that you won&rsquo;t get much spiritual excellence out of a man who lives a
      harder life than the nigger-slaves. If you women could only put aside your
      theories and look a little at obstinate facts! You&rsquo;re all of a piece.
      Which of you was it that talked the other day about getting the vicar to
      pray for rain? Ho, ho, ho! Just the same kind of thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred&rsquo;s combativeness had grown markedly since his making acquaintance
      with Mutimer. He had never excelled in the suaver virtues, and now the
      whole of the time he spent at home was devoted to vociferous railing at
      capitalists, priests, and women, his mother and sister serving for
      illustrations of the vices prevalent in the last-mentioned class. In
      talking he always paced the room, hands in pockets, and at times fairly
      stammered in his endeavour to hit upon sufficiently trenchant epithets or
      comparisons. When reasoning failed with his auditors, he had recourse to
      volleys of contemptuous laughter. At times he lost his temper, muttered
      words such as &lsquo;fools!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;idiots!&rsquo; and flung out into the open air. It
      looked as if the present evening was to be a stormy one. Adela noted the
      presage and allowed herself a protest <i>in limine</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alfred, I do hope you won&rsquo;t go on in this way whilst Letty is here. You
      mayn&rsquo;t think it, but you pain her very much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pain her! It&rsquo;s her education. She&rsquo;s had none yet, no more than you have.
      It&rsquo;s time you both began to learn.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It being close upon the hour for tea, the young lady of whom there was
      question was heard to ring the door-bell. We have already had a passing
      glimpse of her, but since then she has been honoured by becoming Alfred&rsquo;s
      affianced. Letty Tew fulfilled all the conditions desirable in one called
      to so trying a destiny. She was a pretty, supple, sweet-mannered girl,
      and, as is the case with such girls, found it possible to worship a man
      whom in consistency she must have deemed the most condemnable of heretics.
      She and Adela were close friends; Adela indeed, had no other friend in the
      nearer sense. The two were made of very different fibre, but that had not
      as yet distinctly shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela&rsquo;s reproof was not wholly without effect; her brother got through the
      evening without proceeding to his extremest truculence, still the
      conversation was entirely of his leading, consequently not a little
      argumentative. He had brought home, as he always did on Saturday, a batch
      of ultra periodicals, among them the &lsquo;Fiery Cross,&rsquo; and his own eloquence
      was supplemented by the reading of excerpts from these lively columns. It
      was a combat of three to one, but the majority did little beyond throwing
      up hands at anything particularly outrageous. Adela said much less than
      usual. &lsquo;I tell you what it is, you three!&rsquo; Alfred cried, at a certain
      climax of enthusiasm, addressing the ladies with characteristic courtesy,
      &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll found a branch of the Union in Wanley; I mean, in our particular
      circle of thickheads. Then, as soon as Mutimer&rsquo;s settlement gets going, we
      can coalesce. Now you two girls give next week to going round and
      soliciting subscriptions for the &ldquo;Fiery Cross.&rdquo; People have had time to
      get over the first scare, and you know they can&rsquo;t refuse such as you.
      Quarterly, one-and-eightpence, including postage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, my dear Alfred,&rsquo; cried Adela, &lsquo;remember that Letty and I are <i>not</i>
      Socialists!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Letty is, because I expect it of her, and you can&rsquo;t refuse to keep her in
      countenance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls laughed merrily at this anticipated lordship; but Letty said
      presently&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe father will take the paper if I ask him. One is better than
      nothing, isn&rsquo;t it, Alfred?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good. We book Stephen Tew, Esquire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But surely you mustn&rsquo;t call him Esquire?&rsquo; suggested Adela.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, he is yet unregenerate; let him keep his baubles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How are the regenerate designated?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Comrade, we prefer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Also applied to women?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I suppose not. As the word hasn&rsquo;t a feminine, call yourselves plain
      Letty Tew and Adela Waltham, without meaningless prefix.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What nonsense you are talking, Alfred!&rsquo; remarked his mother. &lsquo;As if
      everybody in Wanley could address young ladies by their Christian names!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way did Alfred begin the &lsquo;propaganda&rsquo; at home. Already the village
      was much occupied with the vague new doctrines represented by the name of
      Richard Mutimer; the parlour of the Wheatsheaf was loud of evenings with
      extraordinary debate, and gossips of a higher station had at length found
      a topic which promised to be inexhaustible. Of course the vicar was
      eagerly sounded as to his views. Mr. Wyvern preserved an attitude of
      scrupulous neutrality, contenting himself with correction of palpable
      absurdities in the stories going about. &lsquo;But surely you are not a
      Socialist, Mr. Wyvern?&rsquo; cried Mrs. Mewling, after doing her best to pump
      the reverend gentleman, and discovering nothing. &lsquo;I am a Christian,
      madam,&rsquo; was the reply, &lsquo;and have nothing to do with economic doctrines.&rsquo; 
      Mrs. Mewling spread the phrase &lsquo;economic doctrines,&rsquo; shaking her head upon
      the adjective, which was interpreted by her hearers as condemnatory in
      significance. The half-dozen shopkeepers were disposed to secret
      jubilation; it was probable that, in consequence of the doings in the
      valley, trade would look up. Mutimer himself was a centre of interest such
      as Wanley had never known. When he walked down the street the news that he
      was visible seemed to spread like wildfire; every house had its gazers.
      Excepting the case of the Walthams, he had not as yet sought to make
      personal acquaintances, appearing rather to avoid opportunities. On the
      whole it seemed likely that he would be popular. The little group of
      mothers with marriageable daughters waited eagerly for the day when, by
      establishing himself at the Manor, he would throw off the present
      semi-incognito, and become the recognised head of Wanley society. He would
      discover the necessity of having a lady to share his honours and preside
      at his table. Persistent inquiry seemed to have settled the fact that he
      was not married already. To be sure, there were awesome rumours that
      Socialists repudiated laws divine and human in matrimonial affairs, but
      the more sanguine were inclined to regard this as calumny, their charity
      finding a support in their personal ambitions. The interest formerly
      attaching to the Eldons had altogether vanished. Mrs. Eldon and her son
      were now mere obstacles to be got rid of as quickly as possible. It was
      the general opinion that Hubert Eldon&rsquo;s illness was purposely protracted,
      to suit his mother&rsquo;s convenience. Until Mutimer&rsquo;s arrival there had been
      much talk about Hubert; whether owing to Dr. Mann&rsquo;s indiscretion or
      through the servants at the Manor, it had become known that the young man
      was suffering from a bullet-wound, and the story circulated by Mrs.
      Mewling led gossips to suppose that he had been murderously assailed in
      that land of notorious profligacy known to Wanley as &lsquo;abroad.&rsquo; That,
      however, was now become an old story. Wanley was anxious for the Eldons to
      go their way, and leave the stage clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone of course was aware that Mutimer spent his Sundays in London (a
      circumstance, it was admitted, not altogether reassuring to the ladies
      with marriageable daughters), and his unwonted appearance in the village
      on the evening of the present Saturday excited universal comment. Would he
      appear at church next morning? There was a general directing of eyes to
      the Manor pew. This pew had not been occupied since the fateful Sunday
      when, at the conclusion of the morning service, old Mr. Mutimer was
      discovered to have breathed his last. It was a notable object in the dim
      little church, having a wooden canopy supported on four slim oak pillars
      with vermicular moulding. From pillar to pillar hung dark curtains, so
      that when these were drawn the interior of the pew was entirely protected
      from observation. Even on the brightest days its occupants were veiled in
      gloom. To-day the curtains remained drawn as usual, and Richard Mutimer
      disappointed the congregation. Wanley had obtained assurance on one point&mdash;Socialism
      involved Atheism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it came to pass that someone saw Mutimer approach the Walthams&rsquo; house
      just before dinner time; saw him, moreover, ring and enter. A couple of
      hours, and the ominous event was everywhere being discussed. Well, well,
      it was not difficult to see what <i>that</i> meant. Trust Mrs. Waltham for
      shrewd generalship. Adela Waltham had been formerly talked of in
      connection with young Eldon; but Eldon was now out of the question, and
      behold his successor, in a double sense! Mrs. Mewling surrendered her
      Sunday afternoon nap and flew from house to house&mdash;of course in time
      for the dessert wine at each. Her cry was <i>haro</i>! Really, this was
      sharp practice on Mrs. Waltham&rsquo;s part; it was stealing a march before the
      commencement of the game. Did there not exist a tacit understanding that
      movements were postponed until Mutimer&rsquo;s occupation of the Manor? Adela
      was a very nice young girl, to be sure, a very nice girl indeed, but one
      must confess that she had her eyes open. Would it not be well for united
      Wanley to let her know its opinion of such doings?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Richard was enjoying himself, with as little thought of
      the Wanley gossips as of&mdash;shall we say, the old curtained pew in
      Wanley Church? He was perfectly aware that the Walthams did not represent
      the highest gentility, that there was a considerable interval, for
      example, between Mrs. Waltham and Mrs. Westlake; but the fact remained
      that he had never yet been on intimate terms with a family so refined.
      Radical revolutionist though he was, he had none of the grossness or
      obstinacy which would have denied to the <i>bourgeois</i> household any
      advantage over those of his own class. At dinner he found himself behaving
      circumspectly. He knew already that the cultivated taste objects to the
      use of a table-knife save for purposes of cutting; on the whole he saw
      grounds for the objection. He knew, moreover, that manducation and the
      absorption of fluids must be performed without audible gusto; the
      knowledge cost him some self-criticism. But there were numerous minor
      points of convention on which he was not so clear; it had never occurred
      to him, for instance, that civilisation demands the breaking of bread,
      that, in the absence of silver, a fork must suffice for the dissection of
      fish, that a napkin is a graceful auxiliary in the process of a meal and
      not rather an embarrassing superfluity of furtive application. Like a wise
      man, he did not talk much during dinner, devoting his mind to observation.
      Of one thing he speedily became aware, namely, that Mr. Alfred Waltham was
      so very much in his own house that it was not wholly safe to regard his
      demeanour as exemplary. Another point well certified was that if any
      person in the world could be pointed to as an unassailable pattern of
      comely behaviour that person was Mr. Alfred Waltham&rsquo;s sister. Richard
      observed Adela as closely as good manners would allow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Talking little as yet&mdash;the young man at the head of the table gave
      others every facility for silence&mdash;Richard could occupy his thought
      in many directions. Among other things, he instituted a comparison between
      the young lady who sat opposite to him and someone&mdash;not a young lady,
      it is true, but of the same sex and about the same age. He tried to
      imagine Emma Vine seated at this table; the effort resulted in a
      disagreeable warmth in the lobes of his ears. Yes, but&mdash;he attacked
      himself&mdash;not Emma Vine dressed as he was accustomed to see her;
      suppose her possessed of all Adela Waltham&rsquo;s exterior advantages. As his
      imagination was working on the hint, Adela herself addressed a question to
      him. He looked up, he let her voice repeat itself in inward echo. His ears
      were still more disagreeably warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a lovely day&mdash;warm enough to dine with the windows open. The
      faintest air seemed to waft sunlight from corner to corner of the room;
      numberless birds sang on the near boughs and hedges; the flowers on the
      table were like a careless gift of gold-hearted prodigal summer. Richard
      transferred himself in spirit to a certain square on the borders of Hoxton
      and Islington, within scent of the Regent&rsquo;s Canal. The house there was now
      inhabited by Emma and her sisters; they also would be at dinner. Suppose
      he had the choice: there or here? Adela addressed to him another question.
      The square vanished into space.
    </p>
    <p>
      How often he had spoken scornfully of that word &lsquo;lady&rsquo;! Were not all of
      the sex women? What need for that hateful distinction? Richard tried
      another experiment with his imagination. &lsquo;I had dinner with some people
      called Waltham last Sunday. The old woman I didn&rsquo;t much care about; but
      there was a young woman&mdash;&rsquo; Well, why not? On the other hand, suppose
      Emma Vine called at his lodgings. &lsquo;A young woman called this morning, sir&mdash;&rsquo; 
      Well, why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dessert was on the table. He saw Adela&rsquo;s fingers take an orange, her other
      hand holding a little fruit-knife. Now, who could have imagined that the
      simple paring of an orange could be achieved at once with such consummate
      grace and so naturally? In Richard&rsquo;s country they first bite off a
      fraction of the skin, then dig away with what of finger-nail may be
      available. He knew someone who would assuredly proceed in that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Metamorphosis! Richard Mutimer speculates on asthetic problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You, gentlemen, I dare say will be wicked enough to smoke,&rsquo; remarked Mrs.
      Waltham, as she rose from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you what we shall be wicked enough to do, mother,&rsquo; exclaimed
      Alfred. &lsquo;We shall have two cups of coffee brought out into the garden, and
      spare your furniture!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, my son. Your <i>two</i> cups evidently mean that Adela and I
      are not invited to the garden.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing of the kind. But I know you always go to sleep, and Adela doesn&rsquo;t
      like tobacco smoke.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I go to sleep, Alfred! You know very well that I have a very different
      occupation for my Sunday afternoons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I really don&rsquo;t care anything about smoking,&rsquo; observed Mutimer, with a
      glance at Adela.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you certainly shall not deprive yourself on my account, Mr. Mutimer,&rsquo; 
      said the girl, good-naturedly. &lsquo;I hope soon to come out into the garden,
      and I am not at all sure that my objection to tobacco is serious.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, if Mrs. Mewling could have heard that speech! Mrs. Mewling&rsquo;s age was
      something less than fifty; probably she had had time to forget how a young
      girl such as Adela speaks in pure frankness and never looks back to muse
      over a double meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly three o&rsquo;clock. Adela compared her watch with the
      sitting-room clock, and, the gentlemen having retired, moved about the
      room with a look of uneasiness. Her mother stood at the window, seemingly
      regarding the sky, in reality occupying her thoughts with things much
      nearer. She turned and found Adela looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want just to run over and speak to Letty,&rsquo; Adela said. &lsquo;I shall very
      soon be back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, dear,&rsquo; replied her mother, scanning her face absently. &lsquo;But
      don&rsquo;t let them keep you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela quickly fetched her hat and left the house. It was her habit to walk
      at a good pace, always with the same airy movement, as though her feet
      only in appearance pressed the ground. On the way she again consulted her
      watch, and it caused her to flit still faster. Arrived at the abode of the
      Tews, she fortunately found Letty in the garden, sitting with two younger
      sisters, one a child of five years. Miss Tew was reading aloud to them,
      her book being &lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress.&rsquo; At the sight of Adela the youngest of
      the three slipped down from her seat and ran to meet her with laughter and
      shaking of curls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Carry me round! carry me round!&rsquo; cried the little one.
    </p>
    <p>
      For it was Adela&rsquo;s habit to snatch up the flaxen little maiden, seat her
      upon her shoulder, and trot merrily round a circular path in the garden.
      But the sister next in age, whose thirteenth year had developed deep
      convictions, interposed sharply&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eva, don&rsquo;t be naughty! Isn&rsquo;t it Sunday?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The little one, saved on the very brink of iniquity, turned away in
      confusion and stood with a finger in her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll come and carry you round to-morrow, Eva,&rsquo; said the visitor, stooping
      to kiss the reluctant face. Then, turning to the admonitress, &lsquo;Jessie,
      will you read a little? I want just to speak to Letty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jessie took the volume, made her countenance yet sterner, and, having
      drawn Eva to her side, began to read in measured tones, reproducing as
      well as she could the enunciation of the pulpit. Adela beckoned to her
      friend, and the two walked apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m in such a fix,&rsquo; she began, speaking hurriedly, &lsquo;and there isn&rsquo;t a
      minute to lose. Mr. Mutimer has been having dinner with us; Alfred invited
      him. And I expect Mr. Eldon to come about four o&rsquo;clock. I met him
      yesterday on the Hill; he came up just as I was looking out for Alfred
      with the glass, and I asked him if he wouldn&rsquo;t come and say good-bye to
      mother this afternoon. Of course I&rsquo;d no idea that Mr. Mutimer would come
      to dinner; he always goes away for Sunday. Isn&rsquo;t it dreadfully awkward?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think he wouldn&rsquo;t like to meet Mr. Mutimer?&rsquo; asked Letty, savouring
      the gravity of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure he wouldn&rsquo;t. He spoke about him yesterday. Of course he didn&rsquo;t
      say anything against Mr. Mutimer, but I could tell from his way of
      speaking. And then it&rsquo;s quite natural, isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;m really afraid. He&rsquo;ll
      think it so unkind of me. I told him we should be alone, and I shan&rsquo;t be
      able to explain. Isn&rsquo;t it tiresome?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is, really! But of course Mr. Eldon will understand. To think that it
      should happen just this day!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      An idea flashed across Miss Tew&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you be at the door when he comes, and just&mdash;just say, you
      know, that you&rsquo;re sorry, that you knew nothing about Mr. Mutimer coming?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of something else,&rsquo; returned Adela, lowering her voice, as
      if to impart a project of doubtful propriety. &lsquo;Suppose I walk towards the
      Manor and&mdash;and meet him on the way, before he gets very far? Then I
      could save him the annoyance, couldn&rsquo;t I, dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty widened her eyes. The idea was splendid, but&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t think, dear, that it might be a little&mdash;that you might
      find it&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela reddened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is only a piece of kindness. Mr. Eldon will understand, I&rsquo;m sure. He
      asked me so particularly if we should be alone. I really feel it a duty.
      Don&rsquo;t you think I may go? I must decide at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you really advise me not to&mdash;&rsquo; pursued Adela. &lsquo;But I&rsquo;m sure I
      shall be glad when it&rsquo;s done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then go, dear. Yes, I would go if I were you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela now faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You really would go, in my place?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, I&rsquo;m sure I should. You see, it isn&rsquo;t as if it was Mr. Mutimer
      you were going to meet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no, no That would be impossible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He will be very grateful,&rsquo; murmured Letty, without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I go, it must be at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your mother doesn&rsquo;t know he was coming?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. I don&rsquo;t know why I haven&rsquo;t told her, really. I suppose we were
      talking so much of other things last night. And then I only got home just
      as Alfred did, and he said at once that he had invited Mr. Mutimer. Yes, I
      will go. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll come and see you again after church.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty went back to &lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress.&rsquo; Her sister Jessie enjoyed the
      sound of her own voice, and did not offer to surrender the book, so she
      sat by little Eva&rsquo;s side and resumed her Sunday face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela took the road for the Manor, resisting the impulse to cast glances
      on either side as she passed the houses at the end of the village. She
      felt it to be more than likely that eyes were observing her, as it was an
      unusual time for her to be abroad, and the direction of her walk pointed
      unmistakably to one destination. But she made no account of secrecy; her
      errand was perfectly simple and with an object that no one could censure.
      If people tattled, they alone were to blame. For the first time she
      experienced a little resentment of the public criticism which was so rife
      in Wanley, and the experience was useful&mdash;one of those inappreciable
      aids to independence which act by cumulative stress on a character capable
      of development and softly mould its outlines.
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed the church, then the vicarage, and entered the hedgeway which
      by a long curve led to the Manor. She was slackening her pace, not wishing
      to approach too near to the house, when she at length saw Hubert Eldon
      walking towards her. He advanced with a look which was not exactly
      indifferent yet showed no surprise; the smile only came to his face when
      he was near enough to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have come to meet you,&rsquo; Adela began, with frankness which cost her a
      little agitation of breath. &lsquo;I am so very sorry to have misled you
      yesterday. As soon as I reached home, I found that my brother had invited
      Mr. Mutimer for to-day. I thought it would be best if I came and told you
      that&mdash;that we were not quite alone, as I said we should be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke Adela became distressed by perceiving, or seeming to
      perceive, that the cause which had led her to this step was quite
      inadequate. Of course it was the result of her having to forbear mention
      of the real point at issue; she could not say that she feared it might be
      disagreeable to her hearer to meet Mutimer. But, put in the other way, her
      pretext for coming appeared trivial. Only with an extreme effort she
      preserved her even tone to the end of her speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is very kind of you,&rsquo; Hubert replied almost warmly. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry
      you have had the trouble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As she disclaimed thanks, Eldon&rsquo;s tact discovered the way of safety.
      Facing her with a quiet openness of look, he said, in a tone of pleasant
      directness which Adela had often felt to be peculiarly his own&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall best thank you by admitting that I should have found it very
      unpleasant to meet Mr. Mutimer. You felt that, and hence your kindness. At
      the same time, no doubt, you pity me for my littleness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it perfectly natural that such a meeting should be disagreeable.
      I believe I understand your feeling. Indeed, you explained it to me
      yesterday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I explained it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In what you said about the works in the valley.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True. Many people would have interpreted me less liberally.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela&rsquo;s eyes brightened a little. But when she raised them, they fell upon
      something which disturbed her cheerfulness. This was the face of Mrs.
      Mewling, who had come up from the direction of Wanley and was clearly
      about to pay a visit at the Manor. The lady smiled and murmured a greeting
      as she passed by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose Mrs. Mewling is going to see my mother,&rsquo; said Hubert, who also
      had lost a little of his naturalness.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few more words and they again parted. Nothing further was said of the
      postponed visit. Adela hastened homewards, dreading lest she had made a
      great mistake, yet glad that she had ventured to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother was just going out into the garden, where Alfred&rsquo;s voice
      sounded frequently in laughter or denunciation. Adela would have been glad
      to sit alone for a short time, for Mrs. Waltham seemed to wish for her
      company She had only time to glance at herself in her looking-glass and
      just press a palm against each cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred was puffing clouds from his briar pipe, but Mutimer had ceased
      smoking. Near the latter was a vacant seat; Adela took it, as there was no
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a good thing the day of rest is!&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Waltham. &lsquo;I always
      feel thankful when I think of the poor men who toil so all through the
      week in Belwick, and how they must enjoy their Sunday. You surely wouldn&rsquo;t
      make any change in <i>that</i>, Mr. Mutimer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The change I should like to see would be in the other direction,&rsquo; Richard
      replied. &lsquo;I would have holidays far more frequent. In the towns you can
      scarcely call Sunday a holiday. There&rsquo;s nothing to do but to walk about
      the streets. On the whole it does far more harm than good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do they never go to church?&rsquo; asked Adela. She was experiencing a sort of
      irritation against their guest, a feeling traceable to more than one
      source; Mutimer&rsquo;s frequent glances did not tend to soothe it. She asked
      the question rather in a spirit of adverse criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The working people don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; was the reply, &lsquo;except a Dissenting family
      here and there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps that is one explanation of the Sundays being useless to them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela would scarcely have ventured upon such a tone in reference to any
      secular matter; the subject being religion, she was of course justified in
      expressing herself freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer smiled and held back his rejoinder for a moment. By that time
      Alfred had taken his pipe from his lips and was giving utterance to
      unmeasured scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Mr. Mutimer,&rsquo; said Mrs. Waltham, waving aside her son&rsquo;s vehemence,
      &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t seriously tell us that the working people have no religion?
      Surely that would be too shocking!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I say it seriously, Mrs. Waltham. In the ordinary sense of the word,
      they have no religion. The truth is, they have no time to think of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, but surely it needs no thought&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred exploded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean,&rsquo; pursued his mother, &lsquo;that, however busy we are, there must
      always be intervals to be spared from the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer again delayed his reply. A look which he cast at Adela appeared to
      move her to speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have they not their evenings free, as well as every Sunday?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Happily, Miss Waltham, you can&rsquo;t realise their lives,&rsquo; Richard began. He
      was not smiling now; Adela&rsquo;s tone had struck him like a challenge, and he
      collected himself to meet her. &lsquo;The man who lives on wages is never free;
      he sells himself body and soul to his employer. What sort of freedom does
      a man enjoy who may any day find himself and his family on the point of
      starvation just because he has lost his work? All his life long he has
      before his mind the fear of want&mdash;not only of straitened means, mind
      you, but of destitution and the workhouse. How can such a man put aside
      his common cares? Religion is a luxury; the working man has no luxuries.
      Now, you speak of the free evenings; people always do, when they&rsquo;re asking
      why the working classes don&rsquo;t educate themselves. Do you understand what
      that free evening means? He gets home, say, at six o&rsquo;clock, tired out; he
      has to be up again perhaps at five next morning. What can he do but just
      lie about half asleep? Why, that&rsquo;s the whole principle of the capitalist
      system of employment; it&rsquo;s calculated exactly how long a man can be made
      to work in a day without making him incapable of beginning again on the
      day following&mdash;just as it&rsquo;s calculated exactly how little a man can
      live upon, in the regulation of wages. If the workman returned home with
      strength to spare, employers would soon find it out, and workshop
      legislation would be revised&mdash;because of course it&rsquo;s the capitalists
      that make the laws. The principle is that a man shall have no strength
      left for himself; it&rsquo;s all paid for, every scrap of it, bought with the
      wages at each week end. What religion can such men have? Religion, I
      suppose, means thankfulness for life and its pleasures&mdash;at all
      events, that&rsquo;s a great part of it&mdash;and what has a wage-earner to be
      thankful for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It sounds very shocking,&rsquo; observed Mrs. Waltham, somewhat disturbed by
      the speaker&rsquo;s growing earnestness. Richard paid no attention and continued
      to address Adela.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say you&rsquo;ve heard of the early trains&mdash;workmen&rsquo;s trains&mdash;that
      they run on the London railways. If only you could travel once by one of
      those! Between station and station there&rsquo;s scarcely a man or boy in the
      carriage who can keep awake; there they sit, leaning over against each
      other, their heads dropping forward, their eyelids that heavy they can&rsquo;t
      hold them up. I tell you it&rsquo;s one of the most miserable sights to be seen
      in this world. If you saw it, Miss Waltham, you&rsquo;d pity them, I&rsquo;m very sure
      of that! You only need to know what their life means. People who have
      never known hardship often speak more cruelly than they think, and of
      course it always will be so as long as the rich and the poor are two
      different races, as much apart as if there was an ocean between them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela&rsquo;s cheeks were warm. It was a novel sensation to be rebuked in this
      unconventional way. She was feeling a touch of shame as well as the slight
      resentment which was partly her class-instinct, partly of her sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feel that I have no right to give any opinion,&rsquo; she said in an
      undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Meaning, Adela,&rsquo; commented her brother, &lsquo;that you have a very strong
      opinion and stick to it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One thing I dare say you are thinking, Miss Waltham,&rsquo; Richard pursued,
      &lsquo;if you&rsquo;ll allow me to say it. You think that I myself don&rsquo;t exactly prove
      what I&rsquo;ve been saying&mdash;I mean to say, that I at all events have had
      free time, not only to read and reflect, but to give lectures and so on.
      Yes, and I&rsquo;ll explain that. It was my good fortune to have a father and
      mother who were very careful and hard-working and thoughtful people; I and
      my sister and brother were brought up in an orderly home, and taught from
      the first that ceaseless labour and strict economy were the things always
      to be kept in mind. All that was just fortunate chance; I&rsquo;m not praising
      myself in saying I&rsquo;ve been able to get more into my time than most other
      working men; it&rsquo;s my father and mother I have to thank for it. Suppose
      they&rsquo;d been as ignorant and careless as most of their class are made by
      the hard lot they have to endure; why, I should have followed them, that&rsquo;s
      all. We&rsquo;ve never had to go without a meal, and why? Just because we&rsquo;ve all
      of us worked like slaves and never allowed ourselves to think of rest or
      enjoyment. When my father died, of course we had to be more careful than
      ever; but there were three of us to earn money, fortunately, and we kept
      up the home. We put our money by for the club every week, what&rsquo;s more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The club?&rsquo; queried Miss Waltham, to whom the word suggested Pall Mall and
      vague glories which dwelt in her imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s to make provision for times when we&rsquo;re ill or can&rsquo;t get work,&rsquo; 
      Mutimer explained. &lsquo;If a wage-earner falls ill, what has he to look to?
      The capitalist won&rsquo;t trouble himself to keep him alive; there&rsquo;s plenty to
      take his place. Well, that&rsquo;s my position, or was a few months ago. I don&rsquo;t
      suppose any workman has had more advantages. Take it as an example of the
      most we can hope for, and pray say what it amounts to! Just on the right
      side, just keeping afloat, just screwing out an hour here and there to
      work your brain when you ought to be taking wholesome recreation! That&rsquo;s
      nothing very grand, it seems to me. Yet people will point to it and ask
      what there is to grumble at!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela sat uneasily under Mutimer&rsquo;s gaze; she kept her eyes down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I&rsquo;m not sure that I should always have got on as easily,&rsquo; the speaker
      continued. &lsquo;Only a day or two before I heard of my relative&rsquo;s death, I&rsquo;d
      just been dismissed from my employment; that was because they didn&rsquo;t like
      my opinions. Well, I don&rsquo;t say they hadn&rsquo;t a right to dismiss me, just as
      I suppose you&rsquo;ve a right to kill as many of the enemy as you can in time
      of war. But suppose I couldn&rsquo;t have got work anywhere. I had nothing but
      my hands to depend upon; if I couldn&rsquo;t sell my muscles I must starve,
      that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela looked at him for almost the first time. She had heard this story
      from her brother, but it came more impressively from Mutimer&rsquo;s own lips. A
      sort of heroism was involved in it, the championship of a cause regardless
      of self. She remained thoughtful with troublous colours on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham was more obviously uneasy. There are certain things to which
      in good society one does not refer, first and foremost humiliating
      antecedents. The present circumstances were exceptional to be sure, but it
      was to be hoped that Mr. Mutimer would outgrow this habit of advertising
      his origin. Let him talk of the working-classes if he liked, but always in
      the third person. The good lady began to reflect whether she might not
      venture shortly to give him friendly hints on this and similar subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was nearly tea-time. Mrs. Waltham shortly rose and went into the
      house, whither Alfred followed her. Mutimer kept his seat, and Adela could
      not leave him to himself, though for the moment he seemed unconscious of
      her presence. When they had been alone together for a little while,
      Richard broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope I didn&rsquo;t speak rudely to you; Miss Waltham. I don&rsquo;t think I need
      fear to say what I mean, but I know there are always two ways of saying
      things, and perhaps I chose the roughest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela was conscious of having said a few hard things mentally, and this
      apology, delivered in a very honest voice, appealed to her instinct of
      justice. She did not like Mutimer, and consequently strove against the
      prejudice which the very sound of his voice aroused in her; it was her
      nature to aim thus at equity in her personal judgments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To describe hard things we must use hard words,&rsquo; she replied pleasantly,
      &lsquo;but you said nothing that could offend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear you haven&rsquo;t much sympathy with my way of looking at the question.
      I seem to you to be going to work the wrong way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I certainly think you value too little the means of happiness that we all
      have within our reach, rich and poor alike.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, if you could only see into the life of the poor, you would
      acknowledge that those means are and can be nothing to them. Besides, my
      way of thinking in such things is the same as your brother&rsquo;s, and I can&rsquo;t
      expect you to see any good in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela shook her head slightly. She had risen and was examining the leaves
      upon an apple branch which she had drawn down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I&rsquo;m sure you feel that there is need for doing something,&rsquo; he urged,
      quitting his seat. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not indifferent to the hard lives of the
      people, as most people are who have always lived comfortable lives?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She let the branch spring up, and spoke more coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope I am not indifferent; but it is not in my power to do anything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you let me say that you are mistaken in that?&rsquo; Mutimer had never
      before felt himself constrained to qualify and adorn his phrases; the
      necessity made him awkward. Not only did he aim at polite modes of speech
      altogether foreign to his lips, but his own voice sounded strange to him
      in its forced suppression. He did not as yet succeed in regarding himself
      from the outside and criticising the influences which had got hold upon
      him; he was only conscious that a young lady&mdash;the very type of young
      lady that a little while ago he would have held up for scorn&mdash;was
      subduing his nature by her mere presence and exacting homage from him to
      which she was wholly indifferent. &lsquo;Everyone can give help in such a cause
      as this. You can work upon the minds of the people you talk with and get
      them to throw away their prejudices. The cause of the working classes
      seems so hopeless just because they&rsquo;re too far away to catch the ears of
      those who oppress them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not oppress them, Mr. Mutimer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela spoke with a touch of impatience. She wished to bring this
      conversation to an end, and the man would give her no opportunity of doing
      so. She was not in reality paying attention to his arguments, as was
      evident in her echo of his last words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not willingly, but none the less you do so,&rsquo; he rejoined. &lsquo;Everyone who
      lives at ease and without a thought of changing the present state of
      society is tyrannising over the people. Every article of clothing you put
      on means a life worn out somewhere in a factory. What would your existence
      be without the toil of those men and women who live and die in want of
      every comfort which seems as natural to you as the air you breathe? Don&rsquo;t
      you feel that you owe them something? It&rsquo;s a debt that can very easily be
      forgotten, I know that, and just because the creditors are too weak to
      claim it. Think of it in that way, and I&rsquo;m quite sure you won&rsquo;t let it
      slip from your mind again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred came towards them, announcing that tea was ready, and Adela gladly
      moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t make any impression there,&rsquo; said Alfred with a shrug of
      good-natured contempt. &lsquo;Argument isn&rsquo;t understood by women. Now, if you
      were a revivalist preacher&mdash;&rsquo; Mrs. Waltham and Adela went to church.
      Mutimer returned to his lodgings, leaving his friend Waltham smoking in
      the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way home after service, Adela had a brief murmured conversation
      with Letty Tew. Her mother was walking out with Mrs. Mewling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was evidently pre-arranged,&rsquo; said the latter, after recounting certain
      details in a tone of confidence. &lsquo;I was quite shocked. On <i>his</i> part
      such conduct is nothing less than disgraceful. Adela, of course, cannot be
      expected to know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must tell her,&rsquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela was sitting rather dreamily in her bedroom a couple of hours later
      when her mother entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Little girls shouldn&rsquo;t tell stories,&rsquo; Mrs. Waltham began, with
      playfulness which was not quite natural. &lsquo;Who was it that wanted to go and
      speak a word to Letty this afternoon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t altogether a story, mother,&rsquo; pleaded the girl, shamed, but with
      an endeavour to speak independently. &lsquo;I did want to speak to Letty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you put it off, I suppose? Really, Adela, you must remember that a
      girl of your age has to be mindful of her self-respect. In Wanley you
      can&rsquo;t escape notice; besides&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me explain, mother.&rsquo; Adela&rsquo;s voice was made firm by the suggestion
      that she had behaved unbecomingly. &lsquo;I went to Letty first of all to tell
      her of a difficulty I was in. Yesterday afternoon I happened to meet Mr.
      Eldon, and when he was saying good-bye I asked him if he wouldn&rsquo;t come and
      see you before he left Wanley. He promised to come this afternoon. At the
      time of course I didn&rsquo;t know that Alfred had invited Mr. Mutimer. It would
      have been so disagreeable for Mr. Eldon to meet him here, I made up my
      mind to walk towards the Manor and tell Mr. Eldon what had happened.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should Mr. Eldon have found the meeting with Mr. Mutimer
      disagreeable?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They don&rsquo;t like each other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say not. Perhaps it was as well Mr. Eldon didn&rsquo;t come. I should
      most likely have refused to see him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Refused to see him, mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela gazed in the utmost astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, my dear. I haven&rsquo;t spoken to you about Mr. Eldon, just because I
      took it for granted that he would never come in your way again. That he
      should have dared to speak to you is something beyond what I could have
      imagined. When I went to see Mrs. Eldon on Friday I didn&rsquo;t take you with
      me, for fear lest that young man should show himself. It was impossible
      for you to be in the same room with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With Mr. Hubert Eldon? My dearest mother, what are you saying?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course it surprises you, Adela. I too was surprised. I thought there
      might be no need to speak to you of things you ought never to hear
      mentioned, but now I am afraid I have no choice. The sad truth is that Mr.
      Eldon has utterly disgraced himself. When he ought to have been here to
      attend Mr. Mutimer&rsquo;s funeral, he was living at Paris and other such places
      in the most shocking dissipation. Things are reported of him which I could
      not breathe to you; he is a bad young man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The inclusiveness of that description! Mrs. Waltham&rsquo;s head quivered as she
      gave utterance to the words, for at least half of the feeling she
      expressed was genuine. To her hearer the final phrase was like a
      thunderstroke. In a certain profound work on the history of her country
      which she had been in the habit of studying, the author, discussing the
      character of Oliver Cromwell, achieved a most impressive climax in the
      words, &lsquo;He was a bold, bad man.&rsquo; The adjective &lsquo;bad&rsquo; derived for Adela a
      dark energy from her recollection of that passage; it connoted every
      imaginable phase of moral degradation. &lsquo;Dissipation&rsquo; too; to her pure mind
      the word had a terrible sound; it sketched in lurid outlines hideous
      lurking places of vice and disease. &lsquo;Paris and other such places.&rsquo; With
      the name of Paris she associated a feeling of reprobation; Paris was the
      head-quarters of sin&mdash;at all events on earth. In Paris people went to
      the theatre on Sunday; that fact alone shed storm-light over the
      iniquitous capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood mute with misery, appalled, horrified. It did not occur to her
      to doubt the truth of her mother&rsquo;s accusations; the strange circumstance
      of Hubert&rsquo;s absence when every sentiment of decency would have summoned
      him home corroborated the charge. And she had talked familiarly with this
      man a few hours ago! Her head swam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Mutimer knew it,&rsquo; proceeded her mother, noting with satisfaction the
      effect she was producing. &lsquo;That was why he destroyed the will in which he
      had left everything to Mr. Eldon; I have no doubt the grief killed him.
      And one thing more I may tell you. Mr. Eldon&rsquo;s illness was the result of a
      wound he received in some shameful quarrel; it is believed that he fought
      a duel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl sank back upon her chair. She was white and breathed with
      difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will understand now, my dear,&rsquo; Mrs. Waltham continued, more in her
      ordinary voice, &lsquo;why it so shocked me to hear that you had been seen
      talking with Mr. Eldon near the Manor. I feared it was an appointment.
      Your explanation is all I wanted: it relieves me. The worst of it is,
      other people will hear of it, and of course we can&rsquo;t explain to everyone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should people hear?&rsquo; Adela exclaimed, in a quivering voice. It was
      not that she feared to have the story known, but mingled feelings made her
      almost passionate. &lsquo;Mrs. Mewling has no right to go about talking of me.
      It is very ill-bred, to say nothing of the unkindness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, but it is what we have to be prepared for, Adela. That is the world,
      my child. You see how very careful one has to be. But never mind; it is
      most fortunate that the Eldons are going. I am so sorry for poor Mrs.
      Eldon; who could have thought that her son would turn out so badly! And to
      think that he would have dared to come into my house! At least he had the
      decency not to show himself at church.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela sat silent. The warring of her heart made outward sounds indistinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After all,&rsquo; pursued her mother, as if making a great concession, &lsquo;I fear
      it is only too true that those old families become degenerate. One does
      hear such shocking stories of the aristocracy. But get to bed, dear, and
      don&rsquo;t let this trouble you. What a very good thing that all that wealth
      didn&rsquo;t go into such hands, isn&rsquo;t it? Mr. Mutimer will at all events use it
      in a decent way; it won&rsquo;t be scattered in vulgar dissipation.&mdash;Now
      kiss me, dear. I haven&rsquo;t been scolding you, pet; it was only that I felt I
      had perhaps made a mistake in not telling you these things before, and I
      blamed myself rather than you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham returned to her own room, and after a brief turning over of
      speculations and projects begotten of the new aspect of things, found her
      reward for conscientiousness in peaceful slumber. But Adela was late in
      falling asleep. She, too, had many things to revolve, not worldly
      calculations, but the troubled phantasies of a virgin mind which is
      experiencing its first shock against the barriers of fate.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Richard Mutimer had strong domestic affections. The English artisan is not
      demonstrative in such matters, and throughout his life Richard had
      probably exchanged no word of endearment with any one of his kin, whereas
      language of the tempestuous kind was common enough from him to one and all
      of them; for all that he clung closely to the hearth, and nothing in truth
      concerned him so nearly as the well-being of his mother, his sister, and
      his brother. For them he had rejoiced as much as for himself in the
      blessing of fortune. Now that the excitement of change had had time to
      subside, Richard found himself realising the fact that capital creates
      cares as well as removes them, and just now the centre of his anxieties
      lay in the house at Highbury to which his family had removed from Wilton
      Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      He believed that as yet both the Princess and &lsquo;Arry were ignorant of the
      true state of affairs. It had been represented to them that he had &lsquo;come
      in for&rsquo; a handsome legacy from his relative in the Midlands, together with
      certain business responsibilities which would keep him much away from
      home; they were given to understand that the change in their own position
      and prospects was entirely of their brother&rsquo;s making. If Alice Maud was
      allowed to give up her work, to wear more expensive gowns, even to receive
      lessons on the pianoforte, she had to thank Dick for it. And when &lsquo;Arry
      was told that his clerkship at the drain-pipe manufactory was about to
      terminate, that he might enter upon a career likely to be more fruitful of
      distinction, again it was Dick&rsquo;s brotherly kindness. Mrs. Mutimer did her
      best to keep up this deception.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Richard was well aware that the deception could not be lasting, and
      had the Princess alone been concerned he would probably never have
      commenced it. It was about his brother that he was really anxious. &lsquo;Arry
      might hear the truth any day, and Richard gravely feared the result of
      such a discovery. Had he been destined to future statesmanship, he could
      not have gone through a more profitable course of experience and reasoning
      than that into which he was led by brotherly solicitude. For &lsquo;Arry
      represented a very large section of Demos, alike in his natural
      characteristics and in the circumstances of his position; &lsquo;Arry, being
      &lsquo;Arry, was on the threshold of emancipation, and without the smallest
      likelihood that the event would change his nature. Hence the nut to crack:
      Given &lsquo;Arry, by what rapid process of discipline can he be prepared for a
      state in which the &lsquo;Arrian characteristics will surely prove ruinous not
      only to himself but to all with whom he has dealings?
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard saw reason to deeply regret that the youth had been put to
      clerking in the first instance, and not rather trained for some
      handicraft, clerkships being about the least hopeful of positions for a
      working-class lad of small parts and pronounced blackguard tendencies. He
      came to the conclusion that even now it was not too late to remedy this
      error. &lsquo;Arry must be taught what work meant, and, before he came into
      possession of his means, he must, if possible, be led to devote his poor
      washy brains to some pursuit quite compatible with the standing of a
      capitalist, to acquire knowledge of a kind which he could afterwards use
      for the benefit of his own pocket. Deficient bodily vigour had had
      something to do with his elevation to the office of the drain-pipe
      factory, but that he appeared to have outgrown. Much pondering enabled
      Richard to hit at length on what he considered a hopeful scheme; he would
      apprentice &lsquo;Arry to engineering, and send him in the evenings to follow
      the courses of lectures given to working men at the School of Mines. In
      this way the lad would be kept constantly occupied, he would learn the
      meaning of work and study, and when he became of age would be in a
      position to take up some capitalist enterprise. Thus he might float clear
      of the shoals of black-guardism and develop into a tolerable member of
      society, at all events using his wealth in the direct employment of
      labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have seen Richard engaged in asthetic speculation; now we behold him
      busied in the training of a representative capitalist. But the world would
      be a terrible place if the men of individual energy were at all times
      consistent. Richard knew well enough that in planning thus for his
      brother&rsquo;s future he was inconsistency itself; but then the matter at issue
      concerned someone in whom he had a strong personal interest, and
      consequently he took counsel of facts. When it was only the world at large
      that he was bent on benefiting, too shrewd a sifting of arguments was not
      called for, and might seriously have interfered with his oratorical
      effects. In regulating private interests one cares singularly little for
      anything but hard demonstration and the logic of cause and effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now more than a month since &lsquo;Arry had been removed from the
      drain-pipes and set going on his new course, and Richard was watching the
      experiment gravely. Connected with it was his exceptional stay at Wanley
      over the Sunday; he designed to go up to London quite unexpectedly about
      the middle of the ensuing week, that he might see how things worked in his
      absence. It is true there had been another inducement to remain in the
      village, for Richard had troubles of his own in addition to those imposed
      upon him by his family. The Manor was now at his disposal; as soon as he
      had furnished it there was no longer a reason for delaying his marriage.
      In appearance, that is to say; inwardly there had been growing for some
      weeks reasons manifold. They tormented him. For the first time in his life
      he had begun to sleep indifferently; when he had resolutely put from his
      mind thought of Alice and &lsquo;Arry, and seemed ready for repose, there crept
      out of less obvious lurking-places subtle temptations and suggestions
      which fevered his blood and only allured the more, the more they
      disquieted him. This Sunday night was the worst he had yet known. When he
      left the Walthams, he occupied himself for an hour or two in writing
      letters, resolutely subduing his thoughts to the subjects of his
      correspondence. Then he ate supper, and after that walked to the top of
      Stanbury Hill, hoping to tire himself. But he returned as little prepared
      for sleep as he had set out. Now he endeavoured to think of Emma Vine; by
      way of help, he sat down and began a letter to her. But composition had
      never been so difficult; he positively had nothing to say. Still he must
      think of her. When he went up to town on Tuesday or Wednesday one of his
      first duties would be to appoint a day for his marriage. And he felt that
      it would be a duty harder to perform than any he had ever known. She
      seemed to have drifted so far from him, or he from her. It was difficult
      even to see her face in imagination; another face always came instead, and
      indeed needed no summoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose next morning with a stern determination to marry Emma Vine in less
      than a month from that date.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Tuesday he went to London. A hansom put him down before the house in
      Highbury about six o&rsquo;clock. It was a semidetached villa, stuccoed,
      bow-windowed, of two storeys, standing pleasantly on a wide road skirted
      by similar dwellings, and with a row of acacias in front. He admitted
      himself with a latch-key and walked at once into the front room; it was
      vacant. He went to the dining-room and there found his mother at tea with
      Alice and &lsquo;Arry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mutimer and her younger son were in appearance very much what they
      had been in their former state. The mother&rsquo;s dress was of better material,
      but she was not otherwise outwardly changed. &lsquo;Arry was attired nearly as
      when we saw him in a festive condition on the evening of Easter Sunday;
      the elegance then reserved for high days and holidays now distinguished
      him every evening when the guise of the workshop was thrown off. He still
      wore a waistcoat of pronounced cut, a striking collar, a necktie of
      remarkable hue. It was not necessary to approach him closely to be aware
      that his person was sprinkled with perfumes. A recent acquisition was a
      heavy-looking ring on the little finger of his right hand. Had you been of
      his intimates, &lsquo;Arry would have explained to you the double advantage of
      this ring; not only did it serve as an adornment, but, as playful
      demonstration might indicate, it would prove of singular efficacy in
      pugilistic conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sight of his elder brother, &lsquo;Arry hastily put his hands beneath the
      table, drew off the ornament, and consigned it furtively to his waistcoat
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Alice Maud was by no means what she had been. In all that concerned
      his sister, Mutimer was weak; he could quarrel with her, and abuse her
      roundly for frailties, but none the less was it one of his keenest
      pleasures to see her contented, even in ways that went quite against his
      conscience. He might rail against the vanity of dress, but if Alice needed
      a new gown, Richard was the first to notice it. The neat little silver
      watch she carried was a gift from himself of some years back; with
      difficulty he had resisted the temptation to replace it with a gold one
      now that it was in his power to do so. Tolerable taste and handiness with
      her needle had always kept Alice rather more ladylike in appearance than
      the girls of her class are wont to be, but such comparative distinction no
      longer sufficed. After certain struggles with himself, Richard had told
      his mother that Alice must in future dress &lsquo;as a lady&rsquo;; he authorised her
      to procure the services of a competent dressmaker, and, within the bounds
      of moderation, to expend freely. And the result was on the whole
      satisfactory. A girl of good figure, pretty face, and moderate wit, who
      has spent some years in a City showroom, does not need much instruction in
      the art of wearing fashionable attire becomingly. Alice wore this evening
      a gown which would not have been out of place at five o&rsquo;clock in a
      West-end drawing-room; the sleeves were rather short, sufficiently so to
      exhibit a very shapely lower arm. She had discovered new ways of doing her
      hair; at present it was braided on either side of the forehead&mdash;a
      style which gave almost a thoughtful air to her face. When her brother
      entered she was eating a piece of sponge-cake, which she held to her lips
      with peculiar delicacy, as if rehearsing graces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, there now!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Mutimer, pleased to see her son. &lsquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t
      saying not five minutes ago as Dick was likely to come some day in the
      week! Wasn&rsquo;t I, Alice? What&rsquo;ll you have for your tea? There&rsquo;s some chops
      all ready in the &lsquo;ouse, if you&rsquo;d care for them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard was not in a cheerful mood. He made no reply immediately, but went
      and stood before the fireplace, as he had been accustomed to do in the old
      kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you have a chop?&rsquo; repeated his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; I won&rsquo;t eat just yet. But you can give me a cup of tea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mutimer and Alice exchanged a glance, as the former bent over the
      teapot. Richard was regarding his brother askance, and it resulted in a
      question, rather sharply put&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you been to work to-day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arry would have lied had he dared; as it was, he made his plate revolve,
      and murmured, &lsquo;No; he &lsquo;adn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t feel well,&rsquo; replied the youth, struggling for self-confidence
      and doing his best to put on an air of patient suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard tapped his tea-cup and looked the look of one who reserves
      discussion for a more seasonable time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Daniel called last night,&rsquo; remarked Mrs. Mutimer. &lsquo;He says he wants to
      see you. I think it&rsquo;s something particular; he seemed disappointed you
      weren&rsquo;t at the meeting on Sunday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did he? I&rsquo;ll see if I can get round to-night. If you like to have
      something cooked for me about eight o&rsquo;clock, mother,&rsquo; he added, consulting
      his watch, &lsquo;I shall be ready for it then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to his brother again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there a class to-night? No? Very well, when they&rsquo;ve cleared away, get
      your books out and show me what you&rsquo;ve been doing. What are <i>you</i>
      going to do with yourself, Alice?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The two addressed, as well as their mother, appeared to have some special
      cause for embarrassment. Instead of immediately replying, Alice played
      with crumbs and stole glances on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Me and &lsquo;Arry are going out,&rsquo; she said at length, with a rather timid
      smile and a poise of the head in pretty wilfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not &lsquo;Arry,&rsquo; Richard observed significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; came from the younger Mutimer, with access of boldness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re not well enough to go to work you certainly don&rsquo;t go out at
      night for your pleasure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s a particular occasion,&rsquo; explained Mice, leaning back with
      crossed arms, evidently prepared to do battle. &lsquo;A friend of &lsquo;Arry&rsquo;s is
      going to call and take us to the theatre.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, indeed! And what friend is that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mutimer, who had been talked over to compliance with a project she
      felt Richard would not approve&mdash;she had no longer the old authority,
      and spent her days in trying to piece on the present life to the former&mdash;found
      refuge in a habit more suitable to the kitchen than the dining-room; she
      had collected all the teaspoons within reach and was pouring hot-water
      upon them in the slop-basin, the familiar preliminary to washing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A gen&rsquo;leman as lives near here,&rsquo; responded &lsquo;Arry. &lsquo;He writes for the
      newspapers. His name&rsquo;s Keene.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh? And how came you to know him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Met him,&rsquo; was the airy reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you&rsquo;ve brought him here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, he&rsquo;s been here once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He said as he wanted to know you, Dick,&rsquo; put in Mrs. Mutimer. &lsquo;He was
      really a civil-spoken man, and he gave &lsquo;Arry a lot of help with his
      books.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When was he here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Last Friday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And to-night he wants to take you to the theatre?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was addressed to Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It won&rsquo;t cost him anything,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;He says he can always get free
      passes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt. Is he coming here to fetch you? I shall be glad to see him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard&rsquo;s tone was ambiguous. He put down his cup, and said to Alice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come and let me hear how you get on with your playing.&rsquo; Alice followed
      into the drawing-room. For the furnishing of the new house Richard had not
      trusted to his own instincts, but had taken counsel with a firm that he
      knew from advertisements. The result was commonplace, but not intolerable.
      His front room was regarded as the Princess&rsquo;s peculiar domain; she alone
      dared to use it freely&mdash;declined, indeed, to sit elsewhere. Her
      mother only came a few feet within the door now and then; if obliged by
      Alice to sit down, she did so on the edge of a chair as near to the door
      as possible. Most of her time Mrs. Mutimer still spent in the kitchen. She
      had resolutely refused to keep more than one servant, and everything that
      servant did she all Alice&rsquo;s objections she opposed an obstinate silence.
      What herself performed over again, even to the making of beds. To was the
      poor woman to do? She had never in her life read more than an occasional
      paragraph of police news, and could not be expected to take up literature
      at her age. Though she made no complaint, signs were not wanting that she
      had begun to suffer in health. She fretted through the nights, and was
      never really at peace save when she anticipated the servant in rising
      early, and had an honest scrub at saucepans or fireirons before breakfast.
      Her main discomfort came of the feeling that she no longer had a house of
      her own; nothing about her seemed to be her property with the exception of
      her old kitchen clock, and one or two articles she could not have borne to
      part with. From being a rather talkative woman she had become very
      reticent; she went about uneasily, with a look of suspicion or of fear.
      Her children she no longer ventured to command; the secret of their wealth
      weighed upon her, she was in constant dread on their behalf. It is a bad
      thing for one such as Mrs. Mutimer to be thrown back upon herself in novel
      circumstances, and practically debarred from the only relief which will
      avail her&mdash;free discussion with her own kind. The result is a species
      of shock to the system, sure to manifest itself before long in one or
      other form of debility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice seated herself at the piano, and began a finger exercise,
      laboriously, imperfectly. For the first week or two it had given her vast
      satisfaction to be learning the piano; what more certain sign of having
      achieved ladyhood? It pleased her to assume airs with her teacher&mdash;a
      very deferential lady&mdash;to put off a lesson for a fit of languidness;
      to let it be understood how entirely time was at her command. Now she was
      growing rather weary of flats and sharps, and much preferred to read of
      persons to whom the same nomenclature was very applicable in the books she
      obtained from a circulating library. Her reading had hitherto been
      confined to the fiction of the penny papers; to procure her pleasure in
      three gaily-bound volumes was another evidence of rise in the social
      scale; it was like ordering your wine by the dozen after being accustomed
      to a poor chance bottle now and then. At present Alice spent the greater
      part of her day floating on the gentle milky stream of English romance.
      Her brother was made a little uneasy by this taste; he had not studied the
      literature in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past six a loud knock at the front door announced the expected
      visitor. Alice turned from the piano, and looked at her brother
      apprehensively. Richard rose, and established himself on the hearthrug,
      his hands behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you going to say to him, Dick?&rsquo; Alice asked hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He says he wants to know me. I shall say, &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There were voices outside. &lsquo;Arry had opened the door himself, and now he
      ushered his acquaintance into the drawing-room. Mr. Keene proved to be a
      man of uncertain age&mdash;he might be eight-and-twenty, but was more
      probably ten years older. He was meagre, and of shrewd visage; he wore a
      black frock coat&mdash;rather shiny at the back&mdash;and his collar was
      obviously of paper. Incipient baldness endowed him in appearance with a
      noble forehead; he carried eye-glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst &lsquo;Arry mumbled a form of introduction, the journalist&mdash;so Mr.
      Keene described himself&mdash;stood in a bowing attitude, one hand to his
      glasses, seeming to inspect Richard with extreme yet respectful interest.
      When he spoke, it was in a rather mincing way, with interjected murmurs&mdash;the
      involuntary overflow, as it were, of his deep satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are few persons in England whose acquaintance I desire more than
      that of Mr. Richard Mutimer; indeed, I may leave the statement unqualified
      and say at once that there is no one. I have heard you speak in public,
      Mr. Mutimer. My profession has necessarily led me to hear most of our
      platform orators, and in one respect you distance them all&mdash;in the
      quality of sincerity. No speaker ever moved me as you did. I had long been
      interested in your cause; I had long wished for time and opportunity to
      examine into it thoroughly. Your address&mdash;I speak seriously&mdash;removed
      the necessity of further study. I am of your party, Mr. Mutimer. There is
      nothing I desire so much as to give and take the hand of brotherhood.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He jerked his hand forward, still preserving his respectful attitude.
      Richard gave his own hand carelessly, smiling as a man does who cannot but
      enjoy flattery yet has a strong desire to kick the flatterer out of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you a member of the Union?&rsquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With pride I profess myself a member. Some day&mdash;and that at no
      remote date&mdash;I may have it in my power to serve the cause
      materially.&rsquo; He smiled meaningly. &lsquo;The press&mdash;you understand?&rsquo; He
      spread his fingers to represent wide dominion. &lsquo;An ally to whom the
      columns of the <i>bourgeois</i> press are open&mdash;you perceive? It is
      the task of my life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What papers do you write for?&rsquo; asked Mutimer bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Several, several. Not as yet in a leading capacity. In fact, I am feeling
      my way. With ends such as I propose to myself it won&rsquo;t do to stand
      committed to any formal creed in politics. Politics, indeed! Ha, ha!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed scornfully. Then, turning to Alice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will forgive me, I am sure, Miss Mutimer, that I address myself first
      to your brother&mdash;I had almost said your illustrious brother. To be
      confessed illustrious some day, depend upon it. I trust you are well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thanks, I&rsquo;m very well indeed,&rsquo; murmured Alice, rather disconcerted by
      such politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Mrs. Mutimer? That is well. By-the-by,&rsquo; he proceeded to Richard, &lsquo;I
      have a piece of work in hand that will deeply interest you. I am
      translating the great treatise of Marx, &ldquo;Das capital.&rdquo; It occurs to me
      that a chapter now and then might see the light in the &ldquo;Fiery Cross.&rdquo; How
      do you view that suggestion?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard did not care to hide his suspicion, and even such an announcement
      as this failed to move him to cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You might drop a line about it to Mr. Westlake,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Westlake? Oh! but I quite understood that you had practically the
      conduct of the paper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard again smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Westlake edits it,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keene waved his hand in sign of friendly intelligence. Then he changed
      the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ventured to put at Miss Mutimer&rsquo;s disposal certain tickets I hold&mdash;professionally&mdash;for
      the Regent&rsquo;s Theatre to-night&mdash;the dress circle. I have five seats in
      all. May I have the pleasure of your company, Mr. Mutimer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m only in town for a night,&rsquo; Richard replied; &lsquo;and I can&rsquo;t very well
      spare the time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure, to be sure; I was inconsiderate. Then Miss Mutimer and my
      friend Harry&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry they&rsquo;re not at liberty,&rsquo; was Richard&rsquo;s answer to the murmured
      interrogation. &lsquo;If they had accepted your invitation be&rsquo; so good as to
      excuse them. I happen to want them particularly this evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In that case, I have of course not a word to say, save to express my deep
      regret at losing the pleasure of their company. But another time, I trust.
      I&mdash;I feel presumptuous, but it is my earnest hope to be allowed to
      stand on the footing not only of a comrade in the cause, but of a
      neighbour; I live quite near. Forgive me if I seem a little precipitate.
      The privilege is so inestimable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard made no answer, and Mr. Keene forthwith took his leave, suave to
      the last. When he was gone, Richard went to the dining-room, where his
      mother was sitting. Mrs. Mutimer would have given much to be allowed to
      sit in the kitchen; she had a room of her own upstairs, but there she felt
      too remote from the centre of domestic operations, and the dining-room was
      a compromise. Her chair was always placed in a rather dusky corner; she
      generally had sewing on her lap, but the consciousness that her needle was
      not really in demand, and that she might just as well have sat idle,
      troubled her habits of mind. She often had the face of one growing
      prematurely aged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t let them bring anyone they like,&rsquo; Richard said to her.
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve sent that fellow about his business; he&rsquo;s here for no good. He
      mustn&rsquo;t come again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They won&rsquo;t heed me,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Mutimer, using the tone of little
      interest with which she was accustomed to speak of details of the new
      order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, they&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to heed you, and I&rsquo;ll have that
      understood.&mdash;Why didn&rsquo;t &lsquo;Arry go to work to-day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t want to, I s&rsquo;pose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has he stayed at home often lately?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at &lsquo;ome, but I expect he doesn&rsquo;t always go to work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you go and sit with Alice in the front room? I&rsquo;ll have a talk with
      him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arry came whistling at the summons. There was a nasty look on his face,
      the look which in his character corresponded to Richard&rsquo;s resoluteness.
      His brother eyed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here, &lsquo;Arry,&rsquo; the elder began, &lsquo;I want this explaining. What do you
      mean by shirking your work?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no reply. &lsquo;Arry strode to the window and leaned against the side
      of it, in the attitude of a Sunday loafer waiting for the dram-shop to
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If this goes on,&rsquo; Richard pursued, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll find yourself in your old
      position again. I&rsquo;ve gone to a good deal of trouble to give you a start,
      and it seems to me you ought to show a better spirit. We&rsquo;d better have an
      understanding; do you mean to learn engineering, or don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see the use of it,&rsquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean? I suppose you must make your living somehow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arry laughed, and in such a way that Richard looked at him keenly, his
      brow gathering darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you laughing at?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, at you. There&rsquo;s no more need for me to work for a living than there
      is for you. As if I didn&rsquo;t know that!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s been putting that into your head?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No scruple prevented the lad from breaking a promise he had made to Mr.
      Keene, the journalist, when the latter explained to him the disposition of
      the deceased Richard Mutimer&rsquo;s estate; it was only that he preferred to
      get himself credit for acuteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t think I was to be kept in the dark about a thing like
      that? It&rsquo;s just like you to want to make a fellow sweat the flesh off his
      bones when all the time there&rsquo;s a fortune waiting for him. What have I got
      to work for, I&rsquo;d like to know? I don&rsquo;t just see the fun of it, and you
      wouldn&rsquo;t neither, in my case. You&rsquo;ve took jolly good care you don&rsquo;t work
      yourself, trust you! I ain&rsquo;t a-going to work no more, so there it is,
      plain and flat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard was not prepared for this; he could not hit at once on a new
      course of procedure, and probably it was the uncertainty revealed in his
      countenance that brought &lsquo;Arry to a pitch of boldness not altogether
      premeditated. The lad came from the window, thrust his hands more firmly
      into his pockets and stood prepared to do battle for his freeman&rsquo;s rights
      It is not every day that a youth of his stamp finds himself gloriously
      capable of renouncing work. There was something like a glow of conscious
      virtue on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not going to work any more, eh?&rsquo; said his brother, half to
      himself. &lsquo;And who&rsquo;s going to support you?&rsquo; he asked, with rather forced
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s interest per cent. coming out of my money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arry must not be credited with conscious accuracy in his use of terms; he
      merely jumbled together two words which had stuck in his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh? And what are you going to do with your time?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s my business. How do other men spend their time?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The reply was obvious, but Richard felt the full seriousness of the
      situation and restrained his scornful impulses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit down, will you?&rsquo; he said quietly, pointing to a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      His tone availed more than anger would have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You tell me I take good care not to do any work myself? There you&rsquo;re
      wrong. I&rsquo;m working hard every day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, we know what kind of work that is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think you do. Perhaps it would be as well if you were to see.
      I think you&rsquo;d better go to Wanley with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say I can give you a job for awhile.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you I don&rsquo;t want a job.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard&rsquo;s eye wandered rather vacantly. From the first it had been a
      question with him whether it would not be best to employ &lsquo;Arry at Wanley,
      but on the whole the scheme adopted seemed more fruitful. Had the works
      been fully established it would have been a different thing. Even now he
      could keep the lad at work at Wanley, though not exactly in the way he
      desired. But if it came to a choice between a life of idleness in London
      and such employment as could be found for him at the works, &lsquo;Arry must
      clearly leave town at once. In a few days the Manor would be furnished; in
      a few weeks Emma would be there to keep house.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the difficulty of leaving his mother and sister alone. It looked
      as if all would have to quit London. Yet there would be awkwardness in
      housing the whole family at the Manor; and besides&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      What the &lsquo;besides&rsquo; implied Richard did not make formal even in his own
      thoughts. It stood for a vague objection to having all his relatives
      dwelling at Wanley. Alice he would not mind; it was not impossible to
      picture Alice in conversation with Mrs. and Miss Waltham; indeed, he
      desired that for her. And yet&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard was at an awkward pass. Whithersoever he looked he saw
      stumbling-blocks, the more disagreeable in that they rather loomed in a
      sort of mist than declared themselves for what they were. He had not the
      courage to approach and examine them one by one; he had not the audacity
      to imagine leaps over them; yet somehow they had to be surmounted. At this
      moment, whilst &lsquo;Arry was waiting for the rejoinder to his last reply,
      Richard found himself wrestling again with the troubles which had kept him
      wakeful for the last two nights. He had believed them finally thrown and
      got rid of. Behold, they were more stubborn than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept silence so long that his brother spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What sort of a job is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To his surprise, Richard displayed sudden anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you weren&rsquo;t such a young fool you&rsquo;d see what&rsquo;s best for you, and go on
      as I meant you to! What do you mean by saying you won&rsquo;t work? If you
      weren&rsquo;t such a thickhead you might go to school and be taught how to
      behave yourself, and how a man ought to live; but it&rsquo;s no use sending <i>you</i>
      to any such place. Can&rsquo;t you understand that a man with money has to find
      some sort of position in the world? I suppose you&rsquo;d like to spend the rest
      of your life in public-houses and music-halls?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard was well aware that to give way to his temper was worse than
      useless, and could only defeat every end; but something within him just
      now gnawed so intolerably that there was nothing for it but an outbreak.
      The difficulties of life were hedging him in&mdash;difficulties he could
      not have conceived till they became matter of practical experience. And
      unfortunately a great many of them were not of an honest kind; they would
      not bear exposing. For a man of decision, Mutimer was getting strangely
      remote from practical roads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall live as I like,&rsquo; observed &lsquo;Arry, thrusting out his legs and
      bending his body forward, a combination of movements which, I know not
      why, especially suggests dissoluteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard gave up the contest for the present, and went in silence from the
      room. As he joined his mother and sister they suddenly ceased talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t cook anything for me,&rsquo; he said, remaining near the door. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going
      out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you must have something to eat,&rsquo; protested his mother. &lsquo;See&rsquo;&mdash;she
      rose hastily&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get a chop done at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t eat it if you did. I dare say you&rsquo;ve got some cold meat. Leave
      it out for me; I don&rsquo;t know what time I shall get back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re very unkind, Dick,&rsquo; here remarked Alice, who wore a mutinous look.
      &lsquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t you let us go to the theatre?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother vouchsafed no reply, but withdrew from the room, and almost
      immediately left the house. He walked half a mile with his eyes turned to
      the ground, then noticed a hansom which was passing empty, and had himself
      driven to Hoxton. He alighted near the Britannia Theatre, and thence made
      his way by foul streets to a public-house called the &lsquo;Warwick Castle.&rsquo; 
      Only two customers occupied the bar; the landlord stood in his
      shirt-sleeves, with arms crossed, musing. At the sight of Mutimer he
      brightened up, and extended his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How d&rsquo;you do; how d&rsquo;you do, sir?&rsquo; he exclaimed. &lsquo;Glad to see you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The shake of the hands was a tribute to old times, the &lsquo;sir&rsquo; was a
      recognition of changed circumstances. Mr. Nicholas Dabbs, the brother of
      Daniel, was not a man to lose anything by failure to acknowledge social
      distinctions. A short time ago Daniel had expostulated with his brother on
      the use of &lsquo;sir&rsquo; to Mutimer, eliciting the profound reply, &lsquo;D&rsquo;you think
      he&rsquo;d have &lsquo;ad that glass of whisky if I&rsquo;d called him Dick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dan home yet?&rsquo; Mutimer inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not been in five minutes. Come round, sir, will you? I know he wants to
      see you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A portion of the counter was raised, and Richard passed into a parlour
      behind the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll call him,&rsquo; said the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel appeared immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want a bit of private talk,&rsquo; he said to his brother. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll have this
      door shut, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may as well bring us a drop of something first, Nick,&rsquo; put in
      Richard. &lsquo;Give the order, Dan.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t have &lsquo;ad it but for the &ldquo;sir,&rdquo;&rsquo; chuckled Nicholas to himself.
      &lsquo;Never used to when he come here, unless I stood it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel drew a chair to the table and stirred his tumbler thoughtfully, his
      nose over the steam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;re going to have trouble with &lsquo;Arry,&rsquo; said Richard, who had seated
      himself on a sofa in a dispirited way. &lsquo;Of course someone&rsquo;s been telling
      him, and now the young fool says he&rsquo;s going to throw up work. I suppose I
      shall have to take him down yonder with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Better do so,&rsquo; assented Daniel, without much attention to the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it you want to talk about, Dan?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dabbs had a few minutes ago performed the customary evening cleansing
      of his hands and face, but it had seemed unnecessary to brush his hair,
      which consequently stood upright upon his forehead, a wiry rampart, just
      as it had been thrust by the vigorously-applied towel. This, combined with
      an unwonted lugubriousness of visage, made Daniel&rsquo;s aspect somewhat
      comical. He kept stirring very deliberately with his sugar-crusher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s this, Dick,&rsquo; he began at length. &lsquo;And understand, to begin
      with, that I&rsquo;ve got no complaint to make of nobody; it&rsquo;s only <i>things</i>
      as are awk&rsquo;ard. It&rsquo;s this way, my boy. When you fust of all come and told
      me about what I may call the great transformation scene, you said, &ldquo;Now it
      ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to make no difference, Dan,&rdquo; you said. Now wait till I&rsquo;ve
      finished; I ain&rsquo;t complainin&rsquo; of nobody. Well, and I tried to &lsquo;ope as it
      wouldn&rsquo;t make no difference, though I &lsquo;ad my doubts. &ldquo;Come an&rsquo; see us all
      just as usu&rsquo;l,&rdquo; you said. Well, I tried to do so, and three or four weeks
      I come reg&rsquo;lar, lookin&rsquo; in of a Sunday night. But somehow it wouldn&rsquo;t
      work; something &lsquo;ad got out of gear. So I stopped it off. Then comes &lsquo;Arry
      a-askin&rsquo; why I made myself scarce, sayin&rsquo; as th&rsquo; old lady and the Princess
      missed me. So I looked in again; but it was wuss than before, I saw I&rsquo;d
      done better to stay away. So I&rsquo;ve done ever since. Y&rsquo; understand me,
      Dick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard was not entirely at his ease in listening. He tried to smile, but
      failed to smile naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see what you found wrong,&rsquo; he returned, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I&rsquo;m a-tellin&rsquo; you, my boy, I didn&rsquo;t find nothing wrong except in
      myself, as you may say. What&rsquo;s the good o&rsquo; beatin&rsquo; about the bush? It&rsquo;s
      just this &lsquo;ere, Dick, my lad. When I come to the Square, you know very
      well who it was as I come to see. Well, it stands to reason as I can&rsquo;t go
      to the new &lsquo;ouse with the same thoughts as I did to the old. Mind, I can&rsquo;t
      say as she&rsquo;d ever a&rsquo; listened to me; it&rsquo;s more than likely she wouldn&rsquo;t
      But now that&rsquo;s all over, and the sooner I forget all about it the better
      for me. And th&rsquo; only way to forget is to keep myself to myself,&mdash;see,
      Dick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The listener drummed with his fingers on the table, still endeavouring to
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve thought about all this, Dan,&rsquo; he said at length, with an air of
      extreme frankness. &lsquo;In fact, I meant to have a talk with you. Of course I
      can&rsquo;t speak for my sister, and I don&rsquo;t know that I can even speak to her
      about it, but one thing I can say, and that is that she&rsquo;ll never be
      encouraged by me to think herself better than her old friends.&rsquo; He gave a
      laugh. &lsquo;Why, that &lsquo;ud be a good joke for a man in my position! What am I
      working for, if not to do away with distinctions between capital and
      labour? You&rsquo;ll never have my advice to keep away, Do you suppose I shall
      cry off with Emma Vine just because I&rsquo;ve and that you know. Why, who am I
      going to marry myself? got more money than I used to have?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel&rsquo;s eye was upon him as he said these words, an eye at once
      reflective and scrutinising. Richard felt it, and laughed yet more
      scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think we know you better than that,&rsquo; responded Dabbs. &lsquo;But it ain&rsquo;t
      quite the same thing, you see. There&rsquo;s many a man high up has married a
      poor girl. I don&rsquo;t know how it is; perhaps because women is softer than
      men, and takes the polish easier. And then we know very well how it looks
      when a man as has no money goes after a girl as has a lot. No, no; it
      won&rsquo;t do, Dick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was said with the voice of a man who emphasises a negative in the hope
      of eliciting a stronger argument on the other side. But Richard allowed
      the negative finality in fact, if not in appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s for your own deciding, Dan. All I have to say is that you
      don&rsquo;t stay away with my approval. Understand that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He left Daniel idly stirring the dregs of his liquor, and went off to pay
      another visit. This was to the familiar house in Wilton Square. There was
      a notice in the window that dress-making and millinery were carried on
      within.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clay (Emma&rsquo;s sister Kate) opened to him. She was better dressed than
      in former days, but still untidy. Emma was out making purchases, but could
      not be many minutes. In the kitchen the third sister, Jane, was busy with
      her needle; at Richard&rsquo;s entrance she rose from her chair with evident
      feebleness: her illness of the spring had lasted long, and its effects
      were grave. The poor girl&mdash;she closely resembled Emma in gentleness
      of face, but the lines of her countenance were weaker&mdash;now suffered
      from pronounced heart disease, and the complicated maladies which
      rheumatic fever so frequently leaves behind it in women. She brightened at
      sight of the visitor, and her eyes continued to rest on his face with
      quiet satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of Kate&rsquo;s children was playing on the floor. The mother caught it up
      irritably, and began lamenting the necessity of washing its dirty little
      hands and face before packing it off to bed. In a minute or two she went
      up stairs to discharge these duties. Between her and Richard there was
      never much exchange of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How are you feeling, Jane?&rsquo; Mutimer inquired, taking a seat opposite her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Better&mdash;oh, very much better! The cough hasn&rsquo;t been not near so
      troublesome these last nights.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mind you don&rsquo;t do too much work. You ought to have put your sewing aside
      by now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, this is only a bit of my own. I&rsquo;m sorry to say there isn&rsquo;t very much
      of the other kind to do yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Comes in slowly, does it?&rsquo; Richard asked, without appearance of much
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll be better soon, I dare say. People want time, you see, to get to
      know of us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard&rsquo;s eyes wandered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you finished the port wine yet?&rsquo; he asked, as if to fill a gap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What an idea! Why, there&rsquo;s four whole bottles left, and one as I&rsquo;ve only
      had three glasses out of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Emma was dreadfully disappointed when you didn&rsquo;t come as usual,&rsquo; she said
      presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you got into your house?&rsquo; she asked timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t quite ready yet; but I&rsquo;ve been seeing about the furnishing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane dreamed upon the word. It was her habit to escape from the suffering
      weakness of her own life to joy in the lot which awaited her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Emma will have a room all to herself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane had read of ladies&rsquo; boudoirs; it was her triumph to have won a
      promise from Richard that Emma should have such a chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is it going to be furnished? Do tell me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard&rsquo;s imagination was not active in the spheres of upholstery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t yet say,&rsquo; he replied, as if with an effort to rouse
      himself. &lsquo;How would you like it to be?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane had ever before her mind a vague vision of bright-hued drapery, of
      glistening tables and chairs, of nobly patterned carpet, setting which her
      heart deemed fit for that priceless jewel, her dear sister. But to
      describe it all in words was a task beyond her. And the return of Emma
      herself saved her from the necessity of trying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing her enter the house, Richard went up to meet Emma, and they sat
      together in the sitting-room. This room was just as it had been in Mrs.
      Mutimer&rsquo;s day, save for a few ornaments from the mantelpiece, which the
      old lady could not be induced to leave behind her. Here customers were to
      be received&mdash;when they came; a room upstairs was set apart for work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma wore a slightly anxious look; it showed even through her happiness.
      None the less, the very perceptible change which the last few months had
      wrought in her was in the direction of cheerful activity; her motives were
      quicker, her speech had less of self-distrust, she laughed more freely,
      displayed more of youthful spontaneity in her whole bearing. The joy which
      possessed her at Richard&rsquo;s coming was never touched with disappointment at
      his sober modes of exhibiting affection. The root of Emma&rsquo;s character was
      steadfast faith. She did not allow herself to judge of Richard by the
      impulses of her own heart; those, she argued, were womanly; a man must be
      more independent in his strength. Of what a man ought to be she had but
      one criterion, Richard&rsquo;s self. Her judgment on this point had been formed
      five or six years ago; she felt that nothing now could ever shake it. All
      of expressed love that he was pleased to give her she stored in the shrine
      of her memory; many a light word forgotten by the speaker as soon as it
      was uttered lived still as a part of the girl&rsquo;s hourly life, but his
      reticences she accepted with no less devout humility. What need of
      repetitions? He had spoken to her the decisive word, and it was a column
      established for ever, a monument of that over which time had no power.
      Women are too apt to make their fondness a source of infinite fears; in
      Emma growth of love meant growth of confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does all go well at the works?&rsquo; was her first question. For she had made
      his interests her own, and was following in ardent imagination the
      undertaking which stamped her husband with nobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard talked on the subject for some moments; it was easier to do so
      than to come at once to the words he had in mind. But he worked round by
      degrees, fighting the way hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The house is empty at last.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it? And you have gone to live there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not yet. I must get some furniture in first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma kept silence; the shadows of a smile journeyed trembling from her
      eyes to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question voiced itself from Richard:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When will you be ready to go thither?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I must leave them just yet&mdash;for a
      little longer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not look at her. Emma was reading his face; the characters had
      become all at once a little puzzling; her own fault, of course, but the
      significance she sought was not readily discoverable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t they manage without you?&rsquo; he asked. He believed his tone to express
      annoyance: in fact, it scarcely did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it won&rsquo;t be very long before they can,&rsquo; Emma replied; &lsquo;we have
      some plain sewing to do for Mrs. Robinson at the &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; and she&rsquo;s
      promised to recommend us. I&rsquo;ve just called there, and she really seems
      anxious to help. If Jane was stronger I shouldn&rsquo;t mind so much, but she
      mustn&rsquo;t work hard just yet, and Kate has a great deal to do with the
      children. Besides, Kate can&rsquo;t get out of the slop sewing, and of course
      that won&rsquo;t do for this kind of work. She&rsquo;ll get the stitch very soon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard seemed to be musing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see&rsquo;&mdash;she moved nearer to his side,&mdash;&lsquo;it&rsquo;s only just the
      beginning. I&rsquo;m so afraid that they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to look about for work
      if I left them now. Jane hasn&rsquo;t the strength to go and see people; and
      Kate&mdash;well, you know, Richard, she can&rsquo;t quite suit herself to
      people&rsquo;s fancies. I&rsquo;m sure I can do so much in a few weeks; just that&rsquo;ll
      make all the difference. The beginning&rsquo;s everything, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard&rsquo;s eye travelled over her face. He was not without understanding of
      the nobleness which housed in that plain-clad, simple-featured woman there
      before him. It had shot a ray to the secret places of his heart before
      now; it breathed a passing summer along his veins at this present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What need is there to bother?&rsquo; he said, of purpose fixing his eye
      steadily on hers. &lsquo;Work &lsquo;ll come in time, I dare say. Let them look after
      their house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Emma detected something not wholly sincere in this suggestion. She
      let her eyes fall, then raised them more quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, but it&rsquo;s far better, Richard; and we really have made a beginning.
      Jane, I&rsquo;m sure, wouldn&rsquo;t hear of giving it up. It&rsquo;s wonderful what spirits
      she has. And she&rsquo;d be miserable if she wasn&rsquo;t trying to work&mdash;I know
      so well how it would be. Just a few weeks longer. She really does get much
      better, and she says it&rsquo;s all &ldquo;the business.&rdquo; It gives her something to
      occupy her mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s just as you like,&rsquo; said Richard, rather absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you do think it best, don&rsquo;t you, dear?&rsquo; she urged. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s good to
      finish things you begin, isn&rsquo;t it? I should feel rather dissatisfied with
      myself if I gave it up, and just when everything&rsquo;s promising. I believe
      it&rsquo;s what you really would wish me to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll get the house furnished. But I can&rsquo;t give you much
      longer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued to talk in a mechanical way for a quarter of an hour,
      principally of the works; then said that he had promised to be home for
      supper, and took a rather hasty leave. He called good-night to the sisters
      from the top of the kitchen stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane&rsquo;s face was full of joyous questioning as soon as her sister
      reappeared, but Emma disclosed nothing till they two were alone in the
      bed-room. To Emma it was the simplest thing in the world to put a duty
      before pleasure; she had no hesitation in telling her sister how matters
      stood. And the other accepted it as pure love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll only be a week or two before we can manage for ourselves,&rsquo; 
      Jane said. &lsquo;Of course, people are far readier to give you work than they
      would be to me or Kate. But it&rsquo;ll be all right when we&rsquo;re once started.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be very sorry to leave you, dear,&rsquo; murmured Emma. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have to
      be sure and let me know if you&rsquo;re not feeling well, and I shall come at
      once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As if you could do that!&rsquo; laughed the other. &lsquo;Besides, it&rsquo;ll be quite
      enough to keep me well to know you&rsquo;re happy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do hope Kate won&rsquo;t be trying.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure she won&rsquo;t. Why, it&rsquo;s quite a long time since she had one of
      her worst turns. It was only the hard work and the trouble as worried her.
      And now that&rsquo;s all over. It&rsquo;s you we have to thank for it all, Em.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have to come and be with me sometimes, Jane. I know there&rsquo;ll
      always be something missing as long as you&rsquo;re out of my sight. And you
      must see to it yourself that the sheets is always aired; Kate&rsquo;s often so
      careless about that. You will promise me now, won&rsquo;t you? I shall be
      dreadfully anxious every washing day, I shall indeed. You know that the
      least thing&rsquo;ll give you a chill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll be careful,&rsquo; said the other, half sadly. She was lying in her
      bed, and Emma sat on a chair by the side. &lsquo;But you know it&rsquo;s not much use,
      love. I don&rsquo;t suppose as I shall live so very long. But I don&rsquo;t care, as
      soon as I know you&rsquo;re happy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jane, I should never know happiness if I hadn&rsquo;t my little sister to come
      and talk to. Don&rsquo;t think like that, don&rsquo;t for my sake, Janey dear!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They laid their cheeks together upon the pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll be a good husband,&rsquo; Jane whispered. &lsquo;You know that, don&rsquo;t you,
      Emmy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No better in all this world! Why do you ask so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean anything. He said you mustn&rsquo;t wait much
      longer, didn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he did. But he&rsquo;d rather see me doing what&rsquo;s right. I often feel
      myself such a poor thing by him. I must try and show him that I do my best
      to follow his example. I&rsquo;m ashamed almost, sometimes, to think I shall be
      his wife. It ought to be some one better than me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where would he find any one better, I&rsquo;d like to know? Let him come and
      ask me about that! There&rsquo;s no man good enough for you, sister Emmy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard was talking with his sister Alice; the others had gone to bed, and
      the house was quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wasn&rsquo;t at all pleased to see that man here to-night,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You
      shouldn&rsquo;t have been so ready to say yes when he asked you to go to the
      theatre. It was like his impudence!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what ever&rsquo;s the harm, Dick? Besides, we must have some friends, and&mdash;really
      he looks a gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;ll tell you a secret,&rsquo; returned her brother, with a half-smile,
      half-sneer. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know a gentleman yet, and you&rsquo;ll have to be very
      careful till you do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How am I to learn, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just wait. You&rsquo;ve got enough to do with your music and your reading. Time
      enough for getting acquainted with gentlemen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to let anybody come and see us, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have the old friends,&rsquo; replied Richard, raising his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re thinking of Mr. Dabbs, I suppose. What did he want to see you for,
      Dick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice looked at him from the corner of her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;ll tell you. He says he doesn&rsquo;t intend to come here again.
      You&rsquo;ve made him feel uncomfortable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help how he feels, can I? At all events, Mr. Dabbs isn&rsquo;t a
      gentleman, is he, now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s an honest man, and that&rsquo;s saying a good deal, let me tell you. I
      rather thought you liked him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Liked him? Oh, in a way, of course. But things are different.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How different?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice looked up, put her head on one side, smiled her prettiest, and asked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it true, what &lsquo;Arry says&mdash;about the money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had wanted to get at this, and was, on the whole, not sorry to hear it.
      Richard was studying the derivation of virtue from necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What if it is?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it makes things more different even than I thought, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang to her feet and danced across the room, one hand bent over her
      head. It was not an ungraceful picture. Her brother smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alice, you&rsquo;d better be guided by me. I know a little of the world, and I
      can help you where you&rsquo;d make mistakes. Just keep to yourself for a
      little, my girl, and get on with your piano and your books. You can&rsquo;t do
      better, believe me. Never mind whether you&rsquo;ve any one to see you or not;
      there&rsquo;s time enough. And I&rsquo;ll tell you another secret. Before you can tell
      a gentleman when you see him, you&rsquo;ll have to teach yourself to be a lady.
      Perhaps that isn&rsquo;t quite so easy as you think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How am I to learn then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll find a way before long. Get on with your playing and reading.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, as they were about to leave the room, the Princess inquired:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dick, how soon are you going to be married?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rsquo; was the answer. &lsquo;Emma wants to put it off.&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      The declaration of independence so nobly delivered by his brother &lsquo;Arry
      necessitated Richard&rsquo;s stay in town over the following day. The matter was
      laid before a family council, held after breakfast in the dining-room.
      Richard opened the discussion with some vehemence, and appealed to his
      mother and Alice for support. Alice responded heartily; Mrs. Mutimer was
      slower in coming to utterance, but at length expressed herself in no
      doubtful terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he don&rsquo;t go to his work,&rsquo; she said sternly, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s either him or me&rsquo;ll
      have to leave this house. If he wants to disgrace us all and ruin himself,
      he shan&rsquo;t do it under my eyes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Was there ever a harder case? A high-spirited British youth asserts his
      intention of living a life of elegant leisure, and is forthwith scouted as
      a disgrace to the family. &lsquo;Arry sat under the gross injustice with an air
      of doggish defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought you said I was to go to Wanley?&rsquo; he exclaimed at length,
      angrily, glaring at his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard avoided the look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have to learn to behave yourself first,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;If you can&rsquo;t
      be trusted to do your duty here, you&rsquo;re no good to me at Wanley.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arry would give neither yes nor no. The council broke up after
      formulating an ultimatum.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon Richard had another private talk with the lad. This time
      he addressed himself solely to &lsquo;Arry&rsquo;s self-interest, explained to him the
      opportunities he would lose if he neglected to make himself a practical
      man. What if there was money waiting for him? The use of money was to
      breed money, and nowadays no man was rich who didn&rsquo;t constantly increase
      his capital. As a great ironmaster, he would hold a position impossible
      for him to attain in any other way; he would employ hundreds, perhaps
      thousands, of men; society would recognise him. What could he expect to be
      if he did nothing but loaf about the streets?
    </p>
    <p>
      This was going the right way to work. Richard found that he was making an
      impression, and gradually fell into a kinder tone, so that in the end he
      brought &lsquo;Arry to moderately cheerful acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And don&rsquo;t let men like that Keene make a fool of you,&rsquo; the monitor
      concluded. &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you see that fellows like him&rsquo;ll hang on and make their
      profit out of you if you know no better than to let them? You just keep to
      yourself, and look after your own future.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A suggestion that cunning was required of him flattered the youth to some
      purpose. He had begun to reflect that after all it might be more
      profitable to combine work and pleasure. He agreed to pursue the course
      planned for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Richard returned to Wanley, carrying with him a small satisfaction and
      many great anxieties. Nor did he visit London again until four weeks had
      gone by; it was understood that the pressure of responsibilities grew
      daily more severe. New Wanley, as the industrial settlement in the valley
      was to be named, was shaping itself in accordance with the ideas of the
      committee with which Mutimer took counsel, and the undertaking was no
      small one.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of Emma&rsquo;s cheerful anticipations, &lsquo;the business&rsquo; meanwhile made
      little progress. A graver trouble was the state of Jane&rsquo;s health; the
      sufferer seemed wasting away. Emma devoted herself to her sister. Between
      her and Mutimer there was no further mention of marriage. In Emma&rsquo;s mind a
      new term had fixed itself&mdash;that of her sister&rsquo;s recovery; but there
      were dark moments when dread came to her that not Jane&rsquo;s recovery, but
      something else, would set her free. In the early autumn Richard persuaded
      her to take the invalid to the sea-side, and to remain with her there for
      three weeks. Mrs. Clay during that time lived alone, and was very content
      to receive her future brother-in-law&rsquo;s subsidy, without troubling about
      the work which would not come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Autumn had always been a peaceful and bounteous season at Wanley; then the
      fruit trees bent beneath their golden charge, and the air seemed rich with
      sweet odours. But the autumn of this year was unlike any that had visited
      the valley hitherto. Blight had fallen upon all produce; the crop of
      apples and plums was bare beyond precedent. The west wind breathing up
      between the hill-sides only brought smoke from newly-built chimneys; the
      face of the fields was already losing its purity and taking on a dun hue.
      Where a large orchard had flourished were two streets of small houses,
      glaring with new brick and slate The works were extending by degrees, and
      a little apart rose the walls of a large building which would contain
      library, reading rooms, and lecture-hall, for the use of the industrial
      community. New Wanley was in a fair way to claim for itself a place on the
      map.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Manor was long since furnished, and Richard entertained visitors. He
      had provided himself with a housekeeper, as well as the three or four
      necessary servants, and kept a saddle-horse as well as that which drew his
      trap to and fro when he had occasion to go to Agworth station. His
      establishment was still a modest one; all things considered, it could not
      be deemed inconsistent with his professions. Of course, stories to the
      contrary got about; among his old comrades in London, thoroughgoing
      Socialists like Messrs. Cowes and Cullen, who perhaps thought themselves a
      little neglected by the great light of the Union, there passed
      occasionally nods and winks, which were meant to imply much. There were
      rumours of banqueting which went on at Wanley; the Manor was spoken of by
      some who had not seen it as little less than a palace&mdash;nay, it was
      declared by one or two of the shrewder tongued that a manservant in livery
      opened the door, a monstrous thing if true. Worse than this was the talk
      which began to spread among the Hoxton and Islington Unionists of a
      certain young woman in a poor position to whom Mutimer had in former days
      engaged himself, and whom he did not now find it convenient to marry. A
      few staunch friends Richard had, who made it their business stoutly to
      contradict the calumnies which came within their hearing, Daniel Dabbs the
      first of them. But even Daniel found himself before long preferring
      silence to speech on the subject of Emma Vine. He grew uncomfortable about
      it, and did not know what to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of Richard&rsquo;s visitors at the Manor were Mr. and Mrs. Westlake.
      They came down from London one day, and stayed over till the next. Other
      prominent members of the Union followed, and before the end of the autumn
      Richard entertained some dozen of the rank and file, all together, paying
      their railway fares and housing them from Saturday to Monday. These men,
      be it noted in passing, distinguished themselves from that day onwards by
      unsparing detraction whenever the name of Mutimer came up in private talk,
      though, of course, they were the loudest in applause when platform
      reference to their leader demanded it. Besides the expressly invited,
      there was naturally no lack of visitors who presented themselves
      voluntarily. Among the earliest of these was Mr. Keene, the journalist. He
      sent in his name one Sunday morning requesting an interview on a matter of
      business, and on being admitted, produced a copy of the &lsquo;Belwick
      Chronicle,&rsquo; which contained a highly eulogistic semi-biographic notice of
      Mutimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feel I ought to apologise to you for this liberty,&rsquo; said Keene, in his
      flowing way, &lsquo;and that is why I have brought the paper myself. You will
      observe that it is one of a seris&mdash;notable men of the day. I supply
      the &ldquo;Chronicle&rdquo; with a London letter, and give them one of these little
      sketches fortnightly. I knew your modesty would stand in the way if I
      consulted you in advance, so I can only beg pardon <i>post delictum</i>,
      as we say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There stood the heading in bold type, &lsquo;MEN OF THE DAY,&rsquo; and beneath it
      &lsquo;XI. Mr. Richard Mutimer.&rsquo; Mr. Keene had likewise brought in his pocket
      the placard of the newspaper, whereon Richard saw his name prominently
      displayed. The journalist stayed for luncheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred Waltham was frequently at the Manor. Mutimer now seldom went up to
      town for Sunday; if necessity took him thither, he chose some week-day. On
      Sunday he always spent a longer or shorter time with the Walthams,
      frequently having dinner at their house. He hesitated at first to invite
      the ladies to the Manor; in his uncertainty on social usages he feared
      lest there might be impropriety in a bachelor giving such an invitation.
      He appealed to Alfred, who naturally laughed the scruple to scorn, and
      accordingly Mrs. and Miss Waltham were begged to honour Mr. Mutimer with
      their company. Mrs. Waltham reflected a little, but accepted. Adela would
      much rather have remained at home, but she had no choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of September this invitation had been repeated, and the
      Walthams had lunched a second time at the Manor, no other guests being
      present. On the afternoon of the following day Mrs. Waltham and her
      daughter were talking together in their sitting-room, and the former led
      the conversation, as of late she almost invariably did when alone with her
      daughter, to their revolutionary friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help thinking, Adela, that in all essentials I never knew a more
      gentlemanly man than Mr. Mutimer. There must be something superior in his
      family; no doubt we were altogether mistaken in speaking of him as a
      mechanic.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But he has told us himself that he was a mechanic,&rsquo; replied Adela, in the
      impatient way in which she was wont to speak on this subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that is his modesty. And not only modesty; his views lead him to
      pride himself on a poor origin. He was an engineer, and we know that
      engineers are in reality professional men. Remember old Mr. Mutimer; he
      was a perfect gentleman. I have no doubt the family is really a very good
      one. Indeed, I am all but sure that I remember the name in Hampshire;
      there was a Sir something Mutimer&mdash;I&rsquo;m convinced of it. No one really
      belonging to the working class ever bore himself as Mr. Mutimer does.
      Haven&rsquo;t you noticed the shape of his hands, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve only noticed that they are very large, and just what you would
      expect in a man who had done much rough work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham laughed noisily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear child, how <i>can</i> you be so perverse? The shape of the
      fingers is perfect. Do pray notice them next time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I really cannot promise, mother, to give special attention to Mr.
      Mutimer&rsquo;s hands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham glanced at the girl, who had laid down a book she was trying
      to read, and, with lowered eyes, seemed to be collecting herself for
      further utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why are you so prejudiced, Adela?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not prejudiced at all. I have no interest of any kind in Mr.
      Mutimer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were spoken hurriedly and with a ring almost of hostility. At
      the same time the girl&rsquo;s cheeks flushed. She felt herself hard beset. A
      network was being woven about her by hands she could not deem other than
      loving; it was time to exert herself that the meshes might not be
      completed, and the necessity cost her a feeling of shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But your brother&rsquo;s friend, my dear. Surely you ought not to say that you
      have no interest in him at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do say it, mother, and I wish to say it so plainly that you cannot
      after this mistake me. Alfred&rsquo;s friends are very far from being
      necessarily my friends. Not only have I no interest in Mr. Mutimer, I even
      a little dislike him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had no idea of that, Adela,&rsquo; said her mother, rather blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it is the truth, and I feel I ought to have tried to make you
      understand that sooner. I thought you would see that I had no pleasure in
      speaking of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how is it possible to dislike him? I confess that is very hard for me
      to understand. I am sure his behaviour to you is perfect&mdash;so entirely
      respectful, so gentlemanly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, mother, that is not quite the word to use. You are mistaken; Mr.
      Mutimer is <i>not</i> a perfect gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was said with much decision, for to Adela&rsquo;s mind this clenched her
      argument. Granted the absence of certain qualities which she held
      essential in a gentleman, there seemed to her no reason for another word
      on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray, when has he misbehaved himself?&rsquo; inquired her mother, with a touch
      of pique.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot go into details. Mr. Mutimer has no doubt many excellent
      qualities; no doubt he is really an earnest and a well-meaning man. But if
      I am asked to say more than that, it must be the truth&mdash;as it seems
      to me. Please, mother dear, don&rsquo;t ask me to talk about him in future. And
      there is something else I wish to say. I do hope you won&rsquo;t be offended
      with me, but indeed I&mdash;I hope you will not ask me to go to the Manor
      again. I feel I ought not to go. It is painful; I suffer when I am there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How strange you are to-day, Adela! Really, I think you might allow me to
      decide what is proper and what is not. My experience is surely the best
      judge. You are worse than unkind, Adela; it&rsquo;s rude to speak to me like
      that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear mother,&rsquo; said the girl, with infinite gentleness, &lsquo;I am very, very
      sorry. How could I be unkind or rude to you? I didn&rsquo;t for a moment mean
      that my judgment was better than yours; it is my feelings that I speak of.
      You won&rsquo;t ask me to explain&mdash;to say more than that? You must
      understand me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, my dear, I understand you too well,&rsquo; was the stiff reply. &lsquo;Of
      course I am old-fashioned, and I suppose old-fashioned people are a little
      coarse; <i>their</i> feelings are not quite as fine as they might be. We
      will say no more for the present, Adela. I will do my best not to lead you
      into disagreeable situations through my lack of delicacy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There were tears in Adela&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother, now it is you who are unkind. I am so sorry that I spoke. You
      won&rsquo;t take my words as they were meant. Must I say that I cannot let Mr.
      Mutimer misunderstand the way in which. I regard him? He comes here really
      so very often, and if we begin to go there too&mdash;. People are talking
      about it, indeed they are; Letty has told me so. How can I help feeling
      pained?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham drew out her handkerchief and appeared mildly agitated. When
      Adela bent and kissed her she sighed deeply, then said in an undertone of
      gentle melancholy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ask your pardon, my dear. I am afraid there has been a little
      misunderstanding on both sides. But we won&rsquo;t talk any more of it&mdash;there,
      there!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      By which the good lady of course meant that she would renew the subject on
      the very earliest opportunity, and that, on the whole, she was not
      discouraged. Mothers are often unaware of their daughters&rsquo; strong points,
      but their weaknesses they may be trusted to understand pretty well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little scene was just well over, and Adela had taken a seat by the
      window, when a gentleman who was approaching the front door saw her and
      raised his hat. She went very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment there was a knock at the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; the girl whispered, as if she could not speak louder, &lsquo;it is Mr.
      Eldon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Eldon?&rsquo; Mrs. Waltham drew herself up with dignity, then started from
      her seat. &lsquo;The idea of his daring to come here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She intercepted the servant who was going to open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jane, we are not at home!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid stood in astonishment. She was not used to the polite fictions of
      society; never before had that welcome mortal, an afternoon visitor, been
      refused at Mrs. Waltham&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did you say, please, mum?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will say that we are not at home, neither I nor Miss Waltham.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if Hubert Eldon had not seen Adela at the window he must have been
      dull not to read the meaning of the servant&rsquo;s singular face and tone. He
      walked away with a quiet &lsquo;Thank you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham cast a side glance at Adela when she heard the outer door
      close. The girl had reopened her book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not sorry that he came. Was there ever such astonishing impudence? If
      <i>that</i> is gentlemanly, then I must confess I&mdash;Really I am not at
      all sorry he came: it will give him a lesson.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Eldon may have had some special reason for calling,&rsquo; Adela remarked
      disinterestedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, I have no business of any kind with Mr. Eldon, and it is
      impossible that he can have any with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela very shortly went from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Richard had for guest at dinner Mr. Willis Rodman; so that
      gentleman named himself on his cards, and so he liked to be announced. Mr.
      Rodman was invaluable as surveyor of the works; his experience appeared
      boundless, and had been acquired in many lands. He was now a Socialist of
      the purest water, and already he enjoyed more of Mutimer&rsquo;s intimacy than
      anyone else. Richard not seldom envied the easy and, as it seemed to him,
      polished manner of his subordinate, and wondered at it the more since
      Rodman declared himself a proletarian by birth, and, in private, was fond
      of referring to the hardships of his early life. That there may be no
      needless mystery about Mr. Rodman, I am under the necessity of stating the
      fact that he was the son of a prosperous railway contractor, that he was
      born in Canada, and would have succeeded to a fortune on his father&rsquo;s
      death, but for an unhappy <i>contretemps</i> in the shape of a cheque,
      whereof Mr. Rodman senior (the name was not Rodman, but the true one is of
      no importance) disclaimed the signature. From that day to the present good
      and ill luck had alternated in the young man&rsquo;s career. His fortunes in
      detail do not concern us just now; there will be future occasion for
      returning to the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Young Eldon has been in Wanley to-day,&rsquo; Mr. Rodman remarked as he sat
      over his wine after dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has he?&rsquo; said Richard, with indifference. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s he been after?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I saw him going up towards the Walthams&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard exhibited more interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he a particular friend of theirs?&rsquo; he asked. He had gathered from
      Alfred Waltham that there had been a certain intimacy between the &lsquo;two
      families, but desired more detailed information than his disciple had
      offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, he used to be,&rsquo; replied Rodman, with a significant smile. &lsquo;But I
      don&rsquo;t suppose Mrs. W. gave him a very affectionate reception to-day. His
      little doings have rather startled the good people of Wanley, especially
      since he has lost his standing. It wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered much, I dare
      say, but for that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But was there anything particular up there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer had a careworn expression as he asked, and he nodded his head as
      if in the direction of the village with a certain weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not quite sure. Some say there was, and others deny it, as I gather
      from general conversation. But I suppose it&rsquo;s at an end now, in any case.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Waltham would see to that, you mean?&rsquo; said Mutimer, with a short
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Probably.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodman made his glass revolve, his fingers on the stem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take another cigar. I suppose they&rsquo;re not too well off, the Walthams?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Waltham has an annuity of two hundred and fifty pounds, that&rsquo;s all.
      The girl&mdash;Miss Waltham&mdash;has nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How the deuce do you get to know so much about people, Rodman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The other smiled modestly, and made a silent gesture, as if to disclaim
      any special abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So he called there to-day? I wonder whether he stayed long?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will let you know to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow Richard learnt that Hubert Eldon had been refused
      admittance. The information gave him pleasure. Yet all through the night
      he had been earnestly hoping that he might hear something quite different,
      had tried to see in Eldon&rsquo;s visit a possible salvation for himself. For
      the struggle which occupied him more and more had by this time declared
      its issues plainly enough; daily the temptation became stronger, the
      resources of honour more feeble. In the beginning he had only played with
      dangerous thoughts; to break faith with Emma Vine had appeared an
      impossibility, and a marriage such as his fancy substituted, the most
      improbable of things. But in men of Richard&rsquo;s stamp that which allures the
      fancy will, if circumstances give but a little encouragement, soon take
      hold upon the planning brain. His acquaintance with the Walthams had
      ripened to intimacy, and custom nourished his self-confidence; moreover,
      he could not misunderstand the all but direct encouragement which on one
      or two recent occasions he had received from Mrs. Waltham. That lady had
      begun to talk to him, when they were alone together, in almost a motherly
      way, confiding to him this or that peculiarity in the characters of her
      children, deploring her inability to give Adela the pleasures suitable to
      her age, then again pointing out the advantage it was to a girl to have
      all her thoughts centred in home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can truly say,&rsquo; remarked Mrs. Waltham in the course of the latest such
      conversation, &lsquo;that Adela has never given me an hour&rsquo;s serious uneasiness.
      The dear child has, I believe, no will apart from her desire to please me.
      Her instincts are so beautifully submissive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To a man situated like Mutimer this tone is fatal. In truth it seemed to
      make offer to him of what he supremely desired. No such encouragement had
      come from Adela herself, but that meant nothing either way; Richard had
      already perceived that maidenly reserve was a far more complex matter in a
      girl of gentle breeding, than in those with whom he had formerly
      associated; for all he knew, increase of distance in manner might
      represent the very hope that he was seeking. That hope he sought, in all
      save the hours when conscience lorded over silence, with a reality of
      desire such as he had never known. Perhaps it was not Adela, and Adela
      alone, that inspired this passion; it was a new ideal of the feminine
      addressing itself to his instincts. Adela had the field to herself, and
      did indeed embody in almost an ideal degree the fine essence of distinctly
      feminine qualities which appeal most strongly to the masculine mind.
      Mutimer was not capable of love in the highest sense; he was not, again,
      endowed with strong appetite; but his nature contained possibilities of
      refinement which, in a situation like the present, constituted motive
      force the same in its effects as either form of passion. He was suffering,
      too, from the <i>malaise</i> peculiar to men who suddenly acquire riches;
      secret impulses drove him to gratifications which would not otherwise have
      troubled his thoughts. Of late he had been yielding to several such
      caprices. One morning the idea possessed him that he must have a horse for
      riding, and he could not rest till the horse was purchased and in his
      stable. It occurred to him once at dinner time that there were sundry
      delicacies which he knew by name but had never tasted; forthwith he gave
      orders that these delicacies should be supplied to him, and so there
      appeared upon his breakfast table a <i>pate de foie gras</i>. Very similar
      in kind was his desire to possess Adela Waltham.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the voice of his conscience lost potency, though it troubled him more
      than ever, even as a beggar will sometimes become rudely clamorous when he
      sees that there is no real hope of extracting an alms. Richard was
      embarked on the practical study of moral philosophy; he learned more in
      these months of the constitution of his inner being than all his
      literature of &lsquo;free thought&rsquo; had been able to convey to him. To break with
      Emma, to cast his faith to the winds, to be branded henceforth in the
      sight of his intimate friends as a mere traitor, and an especially mean
      one to boot&mdash;that at the first blush was of the things so impossible
      that one does not trouble to study their bearings. But the wall of habit
      once breached, the citadel of conscience laid bare, what garrison was
      revealed? With something like astonishment, Richard came to recognise that
      the garrison was of the most contemptible and tatterdemalion description.
      Fear of people&rsquo;s talk&mdash;absolutely nothing else stood in his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he, then, no affection for Emma? Hardly a scrap. He had never even
      tried &lsquo;to persuade himself that he was in love with her, and the
      engagement had on his side been an affair of cool reason. His mother had
      practically brought it about; for years it had been a pet project of hers,
      and her joy was great in its realisation. Mrs. Vine and she had been
      lifelong gossips; she knew that to Emma had descended the larger portion
      of her parent&rsquo;s sterling qualities, and that Emma was the one wife for
      such a man as Richard. She talked him into approval. In those days Richard
      had no dream of wedding above his class, and he understood very well that
      Emma Vine was distinguished in many ways from the crowd of working girls.
      There was no one else he wished to marry. Emma would feel herself honoured
      by his choice, and, what he had not himself observed, his mother led him
      to see that yet deeper feelings were concerned on the girl&rsquo;s side. This
      flattered him&mdash;a form of emotion to which he was ever susceptible&mdash;and
      the match was speedily arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never repented. The more he knew of Emma, the more confirmation his
      favourable judgments received. He even knew at times a stirring of the
      senses, which is the farthest that many of his kind ever progress in the
      direction of love. Of the nobler features in Emma&rsquo;s character, he of
      course remained ignorant; they did not enter into his demands upon woman,
      and he was unable to discern them even when they were brought prominently
      before him. She would keep his house admirably, would never contradict
      him, would mother his children to perfection, and even would, go so far as
      to take an intelligent interest in the Propaganda. What more could a man
      look for?
    </p>
    <p>
      So there was no strife between old love and new; so far as it concerned
      himself, to put Emma aside would not cost a pang. The garrison was
      absolutely mere tongue, mere gossip of public-house bars, firesides, etc.&mdash;more
      serious, of the Socialist lecture-rooms. And what of the girl&rsquo;s own
      feeling? Was there no sense of compassion in him? Very little. And in
      saying so I mean anything but to convey that Mutimer was conspicuously
      hard-hearted. The fatal defect in working people is absence of
      imagination, the power which may be solely a gift of nature and
      irrespective of circumstances, but which in most of us owes so much to
      intellectual training. Half the brutal cruelties perpetrated by uneducated
      men and women are directly traceable to lack of the imaginative spirit,
      which comes to mean lack of kindly sympathy. Mutimer, we know, had got for
      himself only the most profitless of educations, and in addition nature had
      scanted him on the emotional side. He could not enter into the position of
      Emma deserted and hopeless. Want of money was intelligible to him, so was
      bitter disappointment at the loss of a good position; but the former he
      would not allow Emma to suffer, and the latter she would, in the nature of
      things, soon get over. Her love for him he judged by his own feeling,
      making allowance, of course, for the weakness of women in affairs such as
      this. He might admit that she would &lsquo;fret,&rsquo; but the thought of her
      fretting did not affect him as a reality. Emma had never been
      demonstrative, had never sought to show him all that was in her heart;
      hence he rated her devotion lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opinion of those who knew him! What of the opinion of Emma herself?
      Yes, that went for much; he knew shame at the thought, perhaps keener
      shame than in anticipating the judgment, say, of Daniel Dabbs. No one of
      his acquaintances thought of him so highly as Emma did; to see himself
      dethroned, the object of her contempt, was a bitter pill to swallow. In
      all that concerned his own dignity Richard was keenly appreciative; he
      felt in advance every pricking of the blood that was in store for him if
      he became guilty of this treachery. Yes, from that point of view he feared
      Emma Vine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considerations of larger scope did not come within the purview of his
      intellect. It never occurred to him, for instance, that in forfeiting his
      honour in this instance he began a process of undermining which would
      sooner or later threaten the stability of the purposes on which he most
      prided himself. A suggestion that domestic perfidy was in the end
      incompatible with public zeal would have seemed to him ridiculous, and for
      the simple reason that he recognised no &lsquo;moral sanctions. He could not
      regard his nature as a whole; he had no understanding for the subtle
      network of communication between its various parts. Nay, he told himself
      that the genuineness and value of his life&rsquo;s work would be increased by a
      marriage with Adela Waltham; he and she would represent the union of
      classes&mdash;of the wage-earning with the <i>bourgeois</i>, between which
      two lay the real gist of the combat. He thought of this frequently, and
      allowed the thought to inspirit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the question of whether Adela would ever find out what he had done,
      and, if so, with what result, he gave scarcely a moment. Marriages are not
      undone by subsequent discovery of moral faults on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a tabular exposition of the man&rsquo;s consciousness. Logically, there
      should result from it a self-possessed state of mind, bordering on
      cynicism. But logic was not predominant in Mutimer&rsquo;s constitution. So far
      from contemplating treason with the calm intelligence which demands
      judgment on other grounds than the common, he was in reality possessed by
      a spirit of perturbation. Such reason as he could command bade him look up
      and view with scorn the ragged defenders of the forts; but whence came
      this hail of missiles which kept him so sore? Clearly there was some
      element of his nature which eluded grasp and definition, a misty influence
      making itself felt here and there. To none of the sources upon which I
      have touched was it clearly traceable; in truth, it arose from them all.
      The man had never in his life been guilty of offence against his graver
      conscience; he had the sensation of being about to plunge from firm
      footing into untried depths. His days were troubled; his appetite was not
      what it should have been; he could not take the old thorough interest in
      his work. It was becoming clear to him that the matter must be settled one
      way or another with brief delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day at the end of September he received a letter addressed by Alice.
      On opening it he found, with much surprise, that the contents were in his
      mother&rsquo;s writing. It was so very rarely that Mrs. Mutimer took up that
      dangerous instrument, the pen, that something unusual must have led to her
      doing so at present. And, indeed, the letter contained unexpected matter.
      There were numerous errors of orthography, and the hand was not very
      legible; but Richard got at the sense quickly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I write this,&rsquo; began Mrs. Mutimer, &lsquo;because it&rsquo;s a long time since you&rsquo;ve
      been to see us, and because I want to say something that&rsquo;s better written
      than spoken. I saw Emma last night, and I&rsquo;m feeling uncomfortable about
      her. She&rsquo;s getting very low, and that&rsquo;s the truth. Not as she says
      anything, nor shows it, but she&rsquo;s got a deal on her hands, and more on her
      mind. You haven&rsquo;t written to her for three weeks. You&rsquo;ll be saying it&rsquo;s no
      business of mine, but I can&rsquo;t stand by and see Emma putting up with things
      as there isn&rsquo;t no reason. Jane is in a very bad way, poor girl; I can&rsquo;t
      think she&rsquo;ll live long. Now, Dick, what I&rsquo;m aiming at you&rsquo;ll see. I can&rsquo;t
      understand why you don&rsquo;t get married and done with it. Jane won&rsquo;t never be
      able to work again, and that Kate &lsquo;ll never keep up a dressmaking. Why
      don&rsquo;t you marry Emma, and take poor Jane to live with you, where she could
      be well looked after? for she won&rsquo;t never part from her sister. And she
      does so hope and pray to see Emma married before she goes. You can&rsquo;t
      surely be waiting for her death. Now, there&rsquo;s a good lad of mine, come and
      marry your wife at once, and don&rsquo;t make delays. That&rsquo;s all, but I hope
      you&rsquo;ll think of it; and so, from your affectionate old mother,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;S. MUTIMER.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard read the letter several times, and sat at home through the morning
      in despondency. It had got to the pass that he could not marry Emma; for
      all his suffering he no longer gave a glance in that direction. Not even
      if Adela Waltham refused him; to have a &lsquo;lady&rsquo; for his wife was now an
      essential in his plans for the future, and he knew that the desired
      possession was purchasable for coin of the realm. No way of retreat any
      longer; movement must be forward, at whatever cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      He let a day intervene, then replied to his mother&rsquo;s letter. He
      represented himself as worked to death and without a moment for his
      private concerns; it was out of the question for him to marry for a few
      weeks yet. He would write to Emma, and would send her all the money she
      could possibly need to supply the sick girl with comforts. She must keep
      up her courage, and be content to wait a short while longer. He was quite
      sure she did not complain; it was only his mother&rsquo;s fancy that she was in
      low spirits, except, of course, on Jane&rsquo;s account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another fortnight went by. Skies were lowering towards winter, and the
      sides of the valley showed bare patches amid the rich-hued death of
      leaves; ere long a night of storm would leave &lsquo;ruined choirs.&rsquo; Richard was
      in truth working hard. He had just opened a course of lectures at a newly
      established Socialist branch in Belwick. The extent of his daily
      correspondence threatened to demand the services of a secretary in
      addition to the help already given by Rodman. Moreover, an event of
      importance was within view; the New Wanley Public Hall was completed, and
      its formal opening must be made an occasion of ceremony. In that ceremony
      Richard would be the central figure. He proposed to gather about him a
      representative company; not only would the Socialist leaders attend as a
      matter of course, invitations should also be sent to prominent men in the
      conventional lines of politics. A speech from a certain Radical statesman,
      who could probably be induced to attend, would command the attention of
      the press. For the sake of preliminary trumpetings in even so humble a
      journal as the &lsquo;Belwick Chronicle,&rsquo; Mutimer put himself in communication
      with Mr. Keene. That gentleman was now a recognised visitor at the house
      in Highbury; there was frequent mention of him in a close correspondence
      kept up between Richard and his sister at this time. The letters which
      Alice received from Wanley were not imparted to the other members of the
      family; she herself studied them attentively, and with much apparent
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      For advice on certain details of the approaching celebration Richard had
      recourse to Mrs. Waltham. He found her at home one rainy morning. Adela,
      aware of his arrival, retreated to her little room upstairs. Mrs. Waltham
      had a slight cold; it kept her close by the fireside, and encouraged
      confidential talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have decided to invite about twenty people to lunch,&rsquo; Richard said.
      &lsquo;Just the members of the committee and a few others. It&rsquo;ll be better than
      giving a dinner. Westlake&rsquo;s lecture will be over by four o&rsquo;clock, and that
      allows people to get away in good time. The workmen&rsquo;s tea will be at
      half-past five.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must have refreshments of some kind for casual comers,&rsquo; counselled
      Mrs. Waltham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of that. Rodman suggests that we shall get the &ldquo;Wheatsheaf&rdquo;
       people to have joints and that kind of thing in the refreshment-room at
      the Hall from half-past twelve to half-past one. We could put up some
      notice to that effect in Agworth station.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, and inside the railway carriages.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer&rsquo;s private line, which ran from the works to Agworth station, was
      to convey visitors to New Wanley on this occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I shall have three or four ladies,&rsquo; Richard pursued &lsquo;Mrs.
      Westlake &lsquo;ll be sure to come&rsquo;, and I think Mrs. Eddlestone&mdash;the wife
      of the Trades Union man, you know. And I&rsquo;ve been rather calculating on
      you, Mrs. Waltham; do you think you could&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady&rsquo;s eyes were turned to the window, watching the sad steady rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really, you&rsquo;re making a downright Socialist of me, Mr. Mutimer,&rsquo; she
      replied, with a laugh which betrayed a touch of sore throat. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m half
      afraid to accept such an invitation. Shouldn&rsquo;t I be there on false
      pretences, don&rsquo;t you think?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard mused; his legs were crossed, and he swayed his foot up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, no, I can&rsquo;t see that. But I tell you what would make it simpler: do
      you think Mr. Wyvern would come if I, asked him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, now, that would be capital! Oh, ask Mr. Wyvern by all means. Then, of
      course, I should be delighted to accept.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I haven&rsquo;t much hope that he&rsquo;ll come. I rather think he regards me as
      his enemy. And, you see, I never go to church.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a pity that is, Mr. Mutimer! Ah, if I could only persuade you to
      think differently about those things! There really are so many texts that
      read quite like Socialism; I was looking them over with Adela on Sunday.
      What a sad thing it is that you go so astray t It distresses me more than
      you think. Indeed, if I may tell you such a thing, I pray for you
      nightly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer made a movement of discomfort, but laughed off the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see the vicar, at all events,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;But must your coming
      depend on his?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It really would make things easier.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Might I, in that case, hope that Miss Waltham would come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard seemed to exert himself to ask the question. Mrs. Waltham sank her
      eyes, smiled feebly, and in the end shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On a public occasion, I&rsquo;m really afraid&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure she would like to know Mrs. Westlake,&rsquo; urged Richard, without
      his usual confidence. &lsquo;And if you and her brother&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it were not a Socialist gathering.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard uncrossed his legs and sat for a moment looking into the fire.
      Then he turned suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Waltham, may I ask her myself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was visibly agitated. There was this time no affectation in the
      tremulous lips and the troublous, unsteady eyes. Mrs. Waltham was not by
      nature the scheming mother who is indifferent to the upshot if she can
      once get her daughter loyally bound to a man of money. Adela&rsquo;s happiness
      was a very real care to her; she would never have opposed an
      unobjectionable union on which she found her daughter&rsquo;s heart bent, but
      circumstances had a second time made offer of brilliant advantages, and
      she had grown to deem it an ordinance of the higher powers that Adela
      should marry possessions. She flattered herself that her study of
      Mutimer&rsquo;s character had been profound; the necessity of making such a
      study excused, she thought, any little excess of familiarity in which she
      had indulged, for it had long been clear to her that Mutimer would some
      day make an offer. He lacked polish, it was true, but really he was more a
      gentleman than a great many whose right to the name was never contested.
      And then he had distinctly high aims: such a man could never be brutal in
      the privacy of his home. There was every chance of his achieving some kind
      of eminence; already she had suggested to him a Parliamentary career, and
      the idea had not seemed altogether distasteful. Adela herself was as yet
      far from regarding Mutimer in the light of a future husband; it was
      perhaps true that she even disliked him. But then a young girl&rsquo;s likes and
      dislikes have, as a rule, small bearing on her practical content in the
      married state; so, at least, Mrs. Waltham&rsquo;s experience led her to believe.
      Only, it was clear that there must be no precipitancy. Let the ground be
      thoroughly prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I advise you, Mr. Mutimer?&rsquo; she said, in a lowered voice, bending
      forward. &lsquo;Let me deliver the invitation. I think it would be better,
      really. We shall see whether you can persuade Mr. Wyvern to be present. I
      promise you to&mdash;in fact, not to interpose any obstacle if Adela
      thinks she can be present at the lunch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll leave it so,&rsquo; said Richard, more cheerfully. Mrs. Waltham could
      see that his nerves were in a dancing state. Really, he had much fine
      feeling.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      It being only midday, Richard directed his steps at once to the Vicarage,
      and had the good fortune to find Mr. Wyvern within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be seated, Mr. Mutimer; I&rsquo;m glad to see you,&rsquo; was the vicar&rsquo;s greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their mutual intercourse had as yet been limited to an exchange of
      courtesies in public, and one or two casual meetings at the Walthams&rsquo; 
      house. Richard had felt shy of the vicar, whom he perceived to be a
      clergyman of other than the weak-brained type, and the circumstances of
      the case would not allow Mr. Wyvern to make advances. The latter proceeded
      with friendliness of tone, speaking of the progress of New Wanley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve come to see you about,&rsquo; said Richard, trying to put
      himself at ease by mentally comparing his own worldly estate with that of
      his interlocutor, yet failing as often as he felt the scrutiny of the
      vicar&rsquo;s dark-gleaming eye. &lsquo;We are going to open the Hall.&rsquo; He added
      details. &lsquo;I shall have a number of friends who are interested in our
      undertaking to lunch with me on that day. I wish to ask if you will give
      us the pleasure of your company.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvern reflected for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, no, sir,&rsquo; he replied at length, using the Johnsonian phrase with
      grave courtesy. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I cannot acknowledge your kindness as I should
      wish to. Personally, I would accept your hospitality with pleasure, but my
      position here, as I understand it, forbids me to join you on that
      particular occasion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then personally you are not hostile to me, Mr. Wyvern?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To you personally, by no means.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you don&rsquo;t like the movement?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In so far as it has the good of men in view it interests me, and I
      respect its supporters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you think we go the wrong way to work?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is my opinion, Mr. Mutimer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What would you have us do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To see faults is a much easier thing than to originate a sound scheme. I
      am far from prepared with any plan of social reconstruction.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor could Mr. Wyvern be moved from the negative attitude, though Mutimer
      pressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry you won&rsquo;t come,&rsquo; Richard said as he rose to take his
      leave. &lsquo;It didn&rsquo;t strike me that you would feel out of place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor should I. But you will understand that my opportunities of being
      useful in the village depend on the existence of sympathetic feeling in my
      parishioners. It is my duty to avoid any behaviour which could be
      misinterpreted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you deliberately adapt yourself to the prejudices of unintelligent
      people?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do so, deliberately,&rsquo; assented the vicar, with one of his fleeting
      smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard went away feeling sorry that he had courted this rejection. He
      would never have thought of inviting a &lsquo;parson&rsquo; but for Mrs. Waltham&rsquo;s
      suggestion. After all, it it mattered little whether Adela came to the
      luncheon or not. He had desired her presence because he wished her to see
      him as an entertainer of guests such as the Westlakes, whom she would
      perceive to be people of refinement; it occurred to him, too, that such an
      occasion might aid his snit by exciting her ambition; for he was anything
      but confident of immediate success with Adela, especially since recent
      conversations with Mrs. Waltham. But in any case she would attend the
      afternoon ceremony, when his glory would be proclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham was anxiously meditative of plans for bringing Adela to
      regard her Socialist wooer with more favourable eyes. She, too, had hopes
      that Mutimer&rsquo;s fame in the mouths of men might prove an attraction, yet
      she suspected a strength of principle in Adela which might well render all
      such hopes vain. And she thought it only too likely, though observation
      gave her no actual assurance of this, that the girl still thought of
      Hubert Eldon in a way to render it doubly hard for any other man to make
      an impression upon her. It was dangerous, she knew, to express her
      abhorrence of Hubert too persistently; yet, on the other hand, she was
      convinced that Adela had been so deeply shocked by the revelations of
      Hubert&rsquo;s wickedness that her moral nature would be in arms against her
      lingering inclination. After much mental wear and tear, she decided to
      adopt the strong course of asking Alfred&rsquo;s assistance. Alfred was sure to
      view the proposed match with hearty approval, and, though he might not
      have much influence directly, he could in all probability secure a potent
      ally in the person of Letty Tew. This was rather a brilliant idea; Mrs.
      Waltham waited impatiently for her son&rsquo;s return from Belwick on Saturday.
    </p>
    <p>
      She broached the subject to him with much delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am so convinced, Alfred, that it would be for your sister&rsquo;s happiness.
      There really is no harm whatever in aiding her inexperience; that is all
      that I wish to do. I&rsquo;m sure you understand me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I understand well enough,&rsquo; returned the young man; &lsquo;but if you convince
      Adela against her will you&rsquo;ll do a clever thing. You&rsquo;ve been so remarkably
      successful in closing her mind against all arguments of reason&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Alfred, do not begin and talk in that way! It has nothing whatever
      to do with the matter. This is entirely a personal question.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing of the kind. It&rsquo;s a question of religious prejudice. She hates
      Mutimer because he doesn&rsquo;t go to church, there&rsquo;s the long and short of
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Adela very properly condemns his views, but that&rsquo;s quite a different
      thing from hating him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear, no; they&rsquo;re one and the same thing. Look at the history of
      persecution. She would like to see him&mdash;and me too, I dare say&mdash;brought
      to the stake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, of course if you won&rsquo;t talk sensibly I had something to
      propose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me hear it, then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You yourself agree with me that there would be nothing to repent in
      urging her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the contrary, I think she might consider herself precious lucky. It&rsquo;s
      only that&rsquo;&mdash;he looked dubious for a moment&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not quite sure
      whether she&rsquo;s the kind of girl to be content with a husband she found she
      couldn&rsquo;t convert. I can imagine her marrying a rake on the hope of
      bringing him to regular churchgoing, but then Mutimer doesn&rsquo;t happen to be
      a blackguard, so he isn&rsquo;t very interesting to her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know what you&rsquo;re thinking of, but I don&rsquo;t think we need take that into
      account. And, indeed, we can&rsquo;t afford to take anything into account but
      her establishment in a respectable and happy home. Our choice, as you are
      aware, is not a wide one. I am often deeply anxious about the poor girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say. Well, what was your proposal?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think Letty could help us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;H&rsquo;m, can&rsquo;t say. Might or might not. She&rsquo;s as bad as Adela. Ten to one
      it&rsquo;ll be a point of conscience with her to fight the project tooth and
      nail.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. She has accepted you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So she has, to my amazement. Women are monstrously illogical. She must
      think of my latter end with mixed feelings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do wish you were less flippant in dealing with grave subjects, Alfred.
      I assure you I am very much troubled. I feel that so much is at stake, and
      yet the responsibility of doing anything is so very great.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I talk it over with Letty?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you feel able to. But Adela would be very seriously offended if she
      guessed that you had done so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then she mustn&rsquo;t guess, that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;ll see what I can do to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the home of the Tews there was some difficulty in securing privacy. The
      house was a small one, and the sacrifice of general convenience when Letty
      wanted a whole room for herself and Alfred was considerable. To-night it
      was managed, however; the front parlour was granted to the pair for one
      hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could not be said that there was much delicacy in Alfred&rsquo;s way of
      approaching the subject he wished to speak of. This young man had a scorn
      of periphrases. If a topic had to be handled, why not be succinct in the
      handling? Alfred was of opinion that much time was lost by mortals in
      windy talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here, Letty; what&rsquo;s your idea about Adela marrying Mutimer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has not accepted him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not yet. Don&rsquo;t you think it would be a good thing if she did?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I really can&rsquo;t say,&rsquo; Letty replied very gravely, her head aside. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
      think any one can judge but Adela herself. Really, Alfred, I don&rsquo;t think
      we ought to interfere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But suppose I ask you to try and get her to see the affair sensibly?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sensibly? What a word to use!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The right word, I think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a vexatious boy you are! You don&rsquo;t really think so at all. You only
      speak so because you like to tease me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you certainly do look pretty when you&rsquo;re defending the castles in
      the air. Give me a kiss.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, I shall not. Tell me seriously what you mean. What does Mrs.
      Waltham think about it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me a kiss, and I&rsquo;ll tell you. If not, I&rsquo;ll go away and leave you to
      find out everything as best you can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Alfred, you&rsquo;re a sad tyrant!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I am. But it&rsquo;s a benevolent despotism. Well, mother wants Adela
      to accept him. In fact, she asked me if I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d help us. Of
      course I said you would.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you were very hasty. I&rsquo;m not joking now, Alfred. I think of Adela in
      a way you very likely can&rsquo;t understand. It would be shocking, oh!
      shocking, to try and make her marry him if she doesn&rsquo;t really wish to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No fear! We shan&rsquo;t manage that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And surely wouldn&rsquo;t wish to?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Girls often can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s best for them. I say, you
      understand that all this is in confidence?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I do. But it&rsquo;s a confidence I had rather not have received. I
      shall be miserable, I know that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you&rsquo;re a little&mdash;goose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were going to call me something far worse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me credit, then, for correcting myself. You&rsquo;ll have to help us,
      Lettycoco.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl kept silence. Then for a time the conversation became graver. It
      was interrupted precisely at the end of the granted hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty went to see her friend on Sunday afternoon, and the two shut
      themselves up in the dainty little chamber. Adela was in low spirits; with
      her a most unusual state. She sat with her hands crossed on her lap, and
      the sunny light of her eyes was dimmed. When she had tried for a while to
      talk of ordinary things, Letty saw a tear glisten upon her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter, love?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela was in sore need of telling her troubles, and Letty was the only one
      to whom she could do so. In such spirit-gentle words as could express the
      perplexities of her mind she told what a source of pain her mother&rsquo;s
      conversation had been to her of late, and how she dreaded what might still
      be to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is so dreadful to think, Letty, that mother is encouraging him. She
      thinks it is for my happiness; she is offended if I try to say what I
      suffer. Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t! I couldn&rsquo;t!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her palms before her face; her maidenhood shamed to speak of these
      things even to her bosom friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you show him, darling, that&mdash;that he mustn&rsquo;t hope anything?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can I do so? It is impossible to be rude, and everything else it is
      so easy to misunderstand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But when he really speaks, then it will come to an end.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall grieve mother so, Letty. I feel as if the best of my life had
      gone by. Everything seemed so smooth. Oh, why did he fall so, Letty? and I
      thought he cared for me, dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She whispered it, her face on her friend&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Try to forget, darling; try!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, as if I didn&rsquo;t try night and day! I know it is so wrong to give a
      thought. How could he speak to me as he did that day when I met him on the
      hill, and again when I went just to save him an annoyance? He was almost
      the same as before, only I thought him a little sad from his illness. He
      had no right to talk to me in that way! Oh, I feel wicked, that I can&rsquo;t
      forget; I hate myself for still&mdash;for still&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a word Letty could not hear, only her listening heart divined
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Adela! pray for strength, and it will be sure to come to you. How
      hard it is to know myself so happy when you have so much trouble!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could have borne it better but for this new pain. I don&rsquo;t think I
      should ever have shown it; even you wouldn&rsquo;t have known all I felt, Letty.
      I should have hoped for him&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean hoped on my own account,
      but that he might know how wicked he had been. How&mdash;how can a man do
      things so unworthy of himself, when it&rsquo;s so beautiful to be good and
      faithful? I think he did care a little for me once, Letty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let us talk of him, pet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are right; we mustn&rsquo;t. His name ought never to pass my lips, only in
      my prayers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She grew calmer, and they sat hand in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Try to make your mother understand,&rsquo; advised Letty. &lsquo;Say that it is
      impossible you should ever accept him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She won&rsquo;t believe that, I&rsquo;m sure she won&rsquo;t. And to think that, even if I
      did it only to please her, people would believe I had married him because
      he is rich!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty spoke with more emphasis than hitherto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you cannot and must not do such a thing to please any one, Adela! It
      is wrong even to think of it. Nothing, nothing can justify that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      How strong she was in the purity of her own love, good little Letty! So
      they talked together, and mingled their tears, and the room was made a
      sacred place as by the presence of sorrowing angels.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The New Wanley Lecture Hall had been publicly dedicated to the service of
      the New Wanley Commonwealth, and only in one respect did the day&rsquo;s
      proceedings fall short of Mutimer&rsquo;s expectations. He had hoped to have all
      the Waltham family at his luncheon party, but in the event Alfred alone
      felt himself able to accept the invitation. Mutimer had even nourished the
      hope that something might happen before that day to allow of Adela&rsquo;s
      appearing not merely in the character of a guest, but, as it were, <i>ex
      officio</i>. By this time he had resolutely forbidden his eyes to stray to
      the right hand or the left, and kept them directed with hungry, relentless
      steadiness straight along the path of his desires. He had received no
      second letter from his mother, nor had Alice anything to report of
      danger-signals at home; from Emma herself came a letter regularly once a
      week, a letter of perfect patience, chiefly concerned with her sister&rsquo;s
      health. He had made up his mind to declare nothing till the irretrievable
      step was taken, when reproaches only could befall him; to Alice as little
      as to any one else had he breathed of his purposes. And he could no longer
      even take into account the uncertainty of his success; to doubt of that
      would have been insufferable at the point which he had reached in
      self-abandonment. Yet day after day saw the postponement of the question
      which would decide his fate. Between him and Mrs. Waltham the language of
      allusion was at length put aside; he spoke plainly of his wishes, and
      sought her encouragement. This was not wanting, but the mother begged for
      time. Let the day of the ceremony come and go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard passed through it in a state of exaltation and anxiety which
      bordered on fever. Mr. Westlake and his wife came down from London by an
      early train, and he went over New Wanley with them before luncheon. The
      luncheon itself did not lack festive vivacity; Richard, in surveying his
      guests from the head of the board, had feelings not unlike those wherein
      King Polycrates lulled himself of old; there wanted, in truth, one thing
      to complete his self-complacence, but an extra glass or two of wine
      enrubied his imagination, and he already saw Adela&rsquo;s face smiling to him
      from the table&rsquo;s unoccupied end. What was such conquest in comparison with
      that which fate had accorded him?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a satisfactory gathering to hear Mr. Westlake&rsquo;s address; Richard
      did not fail to note the presence of a few reporters, only it seemed to
      him that their pencils might have been more active. Here, too, was Adela
      at length; every time his name was uttered, perforce she heard; every
      encomium bestowed upon him by the various speakers was to him like a new
      bud on the tree of hope. After all, why should he feel this humility
      towards her? What man of prominence, of merit, at all like his own would
      ever seek her hand? The semblance of chivalry which occasionally stirred
      within him was, in fact, quite inconsistent with his reasoned view of
      things; the English working class has, on the whole, as little of that
      quality as any other people in an elementary stage of civilisation. He was
      a man, she a woman. A lady, to be sure, but then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      After Mutimer, Alfred Waltham had probably more genuine satisfaction in
      the ceremony than any one else present. Mr. Westlake he was not quite
      satisfied with; there was a mildness and restraint about the style of the
      address which to Alfred&rsquo;s taste smacked of feebleness; he was for
      Cambyses&rsquo; vein. Still it rejoiced him to hear the noble truths of
      democracy delivered as it were from the bema. To a certain order of
      intellect the word addressed by the living voice to an attentive assembly
      is always vastly impressive; when the word coincides with private
      sentiment it excites enthusiasm. Alfred hated the aristocratic order of
      things with a rabid hatred. In practice he could be as coarsely
      overbearing with his social inferiors as that scion of the nobility&mdash;existing
      of course somewhere&mdash;who bears the bell for feebleness of the pia
      mater; but that made him none the less a sound Radical. In thinking of the
      upper classes he always thought of Hubert Eldon, and that name was scarlet
      to him. Never trust the thoroughness of the man who is a revolutionist on
      abstract principles; personal feeling alone goes to the root of the
      matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many were the gentlemen to whom Alfred had the happiness of being
      introduced in the course of the day. Among others was Mr. Keene the
      journalist. At the end of a lively conversation Mr. Keene brought out a
      copy of the &lsquo;Belwick Chronicle,&rsquo; that day&rsquo;s issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find a few things of mine here,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Put it in your pocket,
      and look at it afterwards. By-the-by, there is a paragraph marked; I meant
      it for Mutimer. Never mind, give it him when you&rsquo;ve done with it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred bestowed the paper in the breast pocket of his greatcoat, and did
      not happen to think of it again till late that evening. His discovery of
      it at length was not the only event of the day which came just too late
      for the happiness of one with whose fortunes we are concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little after dark, when the bell was ringing which summoned Mutimer&rsquo;s
      workpeople to the tea provided for them, Hubert Eldon was approaching the
      village by the road from Agworth: he was on foot, and had chosen his time
      in order to enter Wanley unnoticed. His former visit, when he was refused
      at the Walthams&rsquo; door, had been paid at an impulse; he had come down from
      London by an early train, and did not even call to see his mother at her
      new house in Agworth. Nor did ho visit her on his way back; he walked
      straight to the railway station and took the first train townwards. To-day
      he came in a more leisurely way. It was certain news contained in a letter
      from his mother which brought him, and with her he spent some hours before
      starting to walk towards Wanley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hear,&rsquo; Mrs. Eldon had written, &lsquo;from Wanley something which really
      surprises me. They say that Adela Waltham is going to marry Mr. Mutimer.
      The match is surely a very strange one. I am only fearful that it is the
      making of interested people, and that the poor girl herself has not had
      much voice in deciding her own fate. Oh, this money! Adela was worthy of
      better things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eldon saw her son with surprise, the more so that she divined the
      cause of his coming. When they had talked for a while, Hubert frankly
      admitted what it was that had brought him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must know,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;whether the news from Wanley is true&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But can it concern you, Hubert?&rsquo; his mother asked gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no direct reply, but expressed his intention of going over to
      Wanley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whom shall you visit, dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Wyvern.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The vicar? But you don&rsquo;t know him personally.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I know him pretty well. We write to each other occasionally.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eldon always practised most reserve when her surprise was greatest&mdash;an
      excellent rule, by-the-by, for general observation. She looked at her son
      with a half-smile of wonder, but only said &lsquo;Indeed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had made his acquaintance before his coming to Wanley,&rsquo; Hubert
      explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother just bent her head, acquiescent. And with that their
      conversation on the subject ended. But Hubert received a tender kiss on
      his cheek when he set forth in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      To one entering the valley after nightfall the situation of the
      much-discussed New Wanley could no longer be a source of doubt. Two
      blast-furnaces sent up their flare and lit luridly the devastated scene.
      Having glanced in that direction Hubert did his best to keep his eyes
      averted during the remainder of the walk. He was surprised to see a short
      passenger train rush by on the private line connecting the works with
      Agworth station; it was taking away certain visitors who had lingered in
      New Wanley after the lecture. Knowing nothing of the circumstances, he
      supposed that general traffic had been commenced. He avoided the village
      street, and reached the Vicarage by a path through fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the vicar at dinner, though it was only half-past six. The
      welcome he received was, in Mr. Wyvern&rsquo;s manner, almost silent; but when
      he had taken a place at the table he saw satisfaction on his host&rsquo;s face.
      The meal was very plain, but the vicar ate with extraordinary appetite; he
      was one of those men in whom the demands of the stomach seem to be in
      direct proportion to the activity of the brain. A question Hubert put
      about the train led to a brief account of what was going on. Mr. Wyvern
      spoke on the subject with a gravity which was not distinctly ironical, but
      suggested criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      They repaired to the study. A volume of Plato was open on the
      reading-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you remember Socrates&rsquo; prayer in the &ldquo;Phaedrus&rdquo;?&rsquo; said the vicar,
      bending affectionately over the page. He read a few words of the Greek,
      then gave a free rendering. &lsquo;Beloved Pan, and all ye other gods who haunt
      this place, give me beauty in the inward soul; and may the outward and
      inward be at one. May I esteem the wise alone wealthy, and may I have such
      abundance of wealth as none but the temperate can carry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, when I came hither I hoped to find Pan undisturbed. Well, well, after
      all, Hephaestus was one of the gods.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How I envy you your quiet mind!&rsquo; said Hubert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quiet? Nay, not always so. Just now I am far from at peace. What brings
      you hither to-day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The equivoque was obviated by Mr. Wyvern&rsquo;s tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have heard stories about Adela Waltham. Is there any truth in them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear so; I fear so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That she is really going to marry Mr. Mutimer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to speak the name without discourtesy, but his lips writhed after
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear she is going to marry him,&rsquo; said the vicar deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert held his peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It troubles me. It angers me,&rsquo; said Mr. Wyvern. &lsquo;I am angry with more
      than one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there an engagement?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am unable to say. Tattle generally gets ahead of fact.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is monstrous!&rsquo; burst from the young man. &lsquo;They are taking advantage of
      her innocence. She is a child. Why do they educate girls like that? I
      should say, how can they leave them so uneducated? In an ideal world it
      would be all very well, but see what comes of it here? She is walking with
      her eyes open into horrors and curses, and understands as little of what
      awaits her as a lamb led to butchery. Do you stand by and say nothing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It surprises me that you are so affected,&rsquo; remarked the vicar quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt. I can&rsquo;t reason about it. But I know that my life will be
      hideous if this goes on to the end.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are late.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I am late. I was in Wanley some weeks ago; I did not tell you of it.
      I called at their house; they were not at home to me. Yet Adela was
      sitting at the window. What did that mean? Is her mother so contemptible
      that my change of fortune leads her to treat me in that way?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But does no other reason occur to you?&rsquo; asked Mr. Wyvern, with grave
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Other reason! What other?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must remember that gossip is active.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean that they have heard abou&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Somehow it had become the common talk of the village very shortly after
      my arrival here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert dropped his eyes in bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then they think me unfit to associate with them? She&mdash;Adela will
      look upon me as a vile creature! But it wasn&rsquo;t so when I saw her
      immediately after my illness. She talked freely and with just the same
      friendliness as before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Probably she had heard nothing then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And her mother only began to poison her mind when it was advantageous to
      do so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert laughed bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, there is an end of it,&rsquo; he pursued. &lsquo;Yes, I was forgetting all
      that. Oh, it is quite intelligible; I don&rsquo;t blame them. By all means let
      her be preserved from contagion! Pooh! I don&rsquo;t know my own mind. Old
      fancies that I used to have somehow got hold of me again If I ever marry,
      it must be a woman of the world, a woman with brain and heart to judge
      human nature. It is gone, as if I had never had such a thought. Poor
      child, to be sure; but that&rsquo;s all one can say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His tone was as far from petulance as could be. Hubert&rsquo;s emotions were
      never feebly coloured; his nature ran into extremes, and vehemence of
      scorn was in him the true voice of injured tenderness. Of humility he knew
      but little, least of all where his affections were concerned, but there
      was the ring of noble metal in his self-assertion. He would never
      consciously act or speak a falsehood, and was intolerant of the lies,
      petty or great, which conventionality and warped habits of thought
      encourage in those of weaker personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us be just,&rsquo; remarked Mr. Wyvern, his voice sounding rather
      sepulchral after the outburst of youthful passion. &lsquo;Mrs. Waltham&rsquo;s point
      of view is not inconceivable. I, as you know, am not altogether a man of
      formulas, but I am not sure that my behaviour would greatly differ from
      hers in her position; I mean as regards yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes; I admit the reasonableness of it,&rsquo; said Hubert more calmly,
      &lsquo;granted that you have to deal with children. But Adela is too old to have
      no will or understanding. It may be she has both. After all she would
      scarcely allow herself to be forced into a detestable marriage. Very
      likely she takes her mother&rsquo;s practical views.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is such a thing as blank indifference in a young girl who has
      suffered disappointment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could do nothing,&rsquo; exclaimed Hubert. &lsquo;That she thinks of me at all, or
      has ever seriously done so, is the merest supposition. There was nothing
      binding between us. If she is false to herself, experience and suffering
      must teach her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you go your way untroubled?&rsquo; was his next question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I am strong enough to overcome foolishness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if foolishness persists in asserting itself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert kept gloomy silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thus much I can say to you of my own knowledge,&rsquo; observed Mr. Wyvern with
      weight. &lsquo;Miss Waltham is not one to speak words lightly. You call her a
      child, and no doubt her view of the world is childlike; but she is strong
      in her simplicity. A pledge from her will, or I am much mistaken, bear no
      two meanings. Her marriage with Mr. Mutimer would be as little pleasing to
      me as to you, but I cannot see that I have any claim to interpose, or,
      indeed, power to do so. Is it not the same with yourself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, not quite the same.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you have hope that you might still affect her destiny?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you measure the responsibility you would incur? I fear not, if you
      have spoken sincerely. Your experience has not been of a kind to aid you
      in understanding her, and, I warn you, to make her subject to your
      caprices would be little short of a crime, whether now&mdash;heed me&mdash;or
      hereafter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps it is too late,&rsquo; murmured Hubert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That may well be, in more senses than one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you not discover whether she is really engaged?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If that were the case, I think I should have heard of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I were allowed to see her! So much at least should be granted me. I
      should not poison the air she breathes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you return to Agworth to-night?&rsquo; Mr. Wyvern inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I shall walk back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you come to me again to-morrow evening?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was agreed that Hubert should do so. Mr. Wyvern gave no definite
      promise of aid, but the young man felt that he would do something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The night is fine,&rsquo; said the vicar; &lsquo;I will walk half a mile with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They left the Vicarage, and ten yards from the door turned into the path
      which would enable them to avoid the village street. Not two minutes after
      their quitting the main road the spot was passed by Adela herself, who was
      walking towards Mr. Wyvern&rsquo;s dwelling. On her inquiring for the vicar, she
      learnt from the servant that he had just left home. She hesitated, and
      seemed about to ask further questions or leave a message, but at length
      turned away from the door and retraced her steps slowly and with bent
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew not whether to feel glad or sorry that the interview she had come
      to seek could not immediately take place. This day had been a hard one for
      Adela. In the morning her mother had spoken to her without disguise or
      affectation, and had told her of Mutimer&rsquo;s indirect proposal. Mrs. Waltham
      went on to assure her that there was no hurry, that Mutimer had consented
      to refrain from visits for a short time in order that she might take
      counsel with herself, and that&mdash;the mother&rsquo;s voice trembled on the
      words&mdash;absolute freedom was of course left her to accept or refuse.
      But Mrs. Waltham could not pause there, though she tried to. She went on
      to speak of the day&rsquo;s proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think what we may, my dear, of Mr. Mutimer&rsquo;s opinions, no one can deny
      that he is making a most unselfish use of his wealth. We shall have an
      opportunity to-day of hearing how it is regarded by those who&mdash;who
      understand such questions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela implored to be allowed to remain at home instead of attending the
      lecture, but on this point Mrs. Waltham was inflexible. The girl could not
      offer resolute opposition in a matter which only involved an hour or two&rsquo;s
      endurance. She sat in pale silence. Then her mother broke into tears,
      bewailed herself as a luckless being, entreated her daughter&rsquo;s pardon, but
      in the end was perfectly ready to accept Adela&rsquo;s self-sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her return from New Wanley, Adela sat alone till tea-time, and after
      that meal again went to her room. She was not one of those girls to whom
      tears come as a matter of course on any occasion of annoyance or of grief;
      her bright eyes had seldom been dimmed since childhood, for the
      lightsomeness of her character threw off trifling troubles almost as soon
      as they were felt, and of graver afflictions she had hitherto known none
      since her father&rsquo;s death. But since the shock she received on that day
      when her mother revealed Hubert Eldon&rsquo;s unworthiness, her emotional life
      had suffered a slow change. Evil, previously known but as a dark mystery
      shadowing far-off regions, had become the constant preoccupation of her
      thoughts. Drawing analogies from the story of her faith, she imaged Hubert
      as the angel who fell from supreme purity to a terrible lordship of
      perdition. Of his sins she had the dimmest conception; she was told that
      they were sins of impurity, and her understanding of such could scarcely
      have been expressed save in the general language of her prayers. Guarded
      jealously at every moment of her life, the world had made no blur on the
      fair tablet of her mind; her Eden had suffered no invasion. She could only
      repeat to herself that her heart had gone dreadfully astray in its
      fondness, and that, whatsoever it cost her, the old hopes, the strength of
      which was only now proved, must be utterly uprooted. And knowing that, she
      wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sin was too surely sorrow, though it neared her only in imagination. In a
      few weeks she seemed to have almost outgrown girlhood; her steps were
      measured, her smile was seldom and lacked mirth. The revelation would have
      done so much; the added and growing trouble of Mutimer&rsquo;s attentions
      threatened to sink her in melancholy. She would not allow it to be seen
      more than she could help; cheerful activity in the life of home was one of
      her moral duties, and she strove hard to sustain it. It was a relief to
      find herself alone each night, alone with her sickness of heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The repugnance aroused in her by the thought of becoming Mutimer&rsquo;s wife
      was rather instinctive than reasoned. From one point of view, indeed, she
      deemed it wrong, since it might be entirely the fruit of the love she was
      forbidden to cherish. Striving to read her conscience, which for years had
      been with her a daily task and was now become the anguish of every hour,
      she found it hard to establish valid reasons for steadfastly refusing a
      man who was her mother&rsquo;s choice. She read over the marriage service
      frequently. There stood the promise&mdash;to love, to honour, and to obey.
      Honour and obedience she might render him, but what of love? The question
      arose, what did love mean? Could there be such a thing as love of an
      unworthy object? Was she not led astray by the spirit of perverseness
      which was her heritage?
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela could not bring herself to believe that &lsquo;to love&rsquo; in the sense of
      the marriage service and to &lsquo;be in love&rsquo; as her heart understood it were
      one and the same thing. The Puritanism of her training led her to distrust
      profoundly those impulses of mere nature. And the circumstances of her own
      unhappy affection tended to confirm her in this way of thinking. Letty Tew
      certainly thought otherwise, but was not Letty&rsquo;s own heart too exclusively
      occupied by worldly considerations?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it said &lsquo;love.&rsquo; Perchance that was something which would come after
      marriage; the promise, observe, concerned the future. But she was not
      merely indifferent; she shrank from Mutimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned home from the lecture to-day full of dread&mdash;dread more
      active than she had yet known. And it drove her to a step she had timidly
      contemplated for more than a week. She stole from the house, bent on
      seeing Mr. Wyvern. She could not confess to him, but she could speak of
      the conflict between her mother&rsquo;s will and her own, and beg his advice;
      perhaps, if he appeared favourable, ask him to intercede with her mother.
      She had liked Mr. Wyvern from the first meeting with him, and a sense of
      trust had been nourished by each succeeding conversation. In her agitation
      she thought it would not be hard to tell him so much of the circumstances
      as would enable him to judge and counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was with relief, on the whole, that she turned homewards with her
      object unattained. It would be much better to wait and test herself yet
      further. Why should she not speak with her mother about that vow she was
      asked to make?
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not seek solitude again, but joined her mother and Alfred in the
      sitting-room. Mrs. Waltham made no inquiry about the short absence. Alfred
      had only just called to mind the newspaper which Mr. Keene had given him;
      and was unfolding it for perusal. His eye caught a marked paragraph, one
      of a number under the heading &lsquo;Gossip from Town.&rsquo; As he read it he uttered
      a &lsquo;Hullo!&rsquo; of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, here&rsquo;s the latest,&rsquo; he continued, looking at his companions with an
      amused eye. &lsquo;Something about that fellow Eldon in a Belwick newspaper.
      What do you think?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela kept still and mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whatever it is, it cannot interest us, Alfred,&rsquo; said Mrs. Waltham, with
      dignity. &lsquo;We had rather not hear it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you shall read it for yourself,&rsquo; replied Alfred on a second
      thought. &lsquo;I think you&rsquo;d like to know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother took the paper under protest, and glanced down at the paragraph
      carelessly. But speedily her attention became closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An item of intelligence,&rsquo; wrote the London gossiper, &lsquo;which I dare say
      will interest readers in certain parts of&mdash;shire. A lady of French
      extraction who made a name for herself at a leading metropolitan theatre
      last winter, and who really promises great things in the Thespian art, is
      back among us from a sojourn on the Continent. She is understood to have
      spent much labour in the study of a new part, which she is about to
      introduce to us of the modern Babylon. But Albion, it is whispered,
      possesses other attractions for her besides appreciative audiences. In
      brief, though she will of course appear under the old name, she will in
      reality have changed it for one of another nationality before presenting
      herself in the radiance of the footlights. The happy man is Mr. Hubert
      Eldon, late of Wanley Manor. We felicitate Mr. Eldon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham&rsquo;s hands trembled as she doubled the sheet: there was a gleam
      of pleasure on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me the paper when you have done with it,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred laughed, and whistled a tune as he continued the perusal of Mr.
      Keene&rsquo;s political and social intelligence, on the whole as trustworthy as
      the style in which it was written was terse and elegant. Adela, finding
      she could feign indifference no longer, went from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where did you get this?&rsquo; Mrs. Waltham asked with eagerness as soon as the
      girl was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From the writer himself,&rsquo; Alfred replied, visibly proud of his intimacy
      with a man of letters. &lsquo;Fellow called Keene. Had a long talk with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no. I&rsquo;ve only just come across it. But he said he&rsquo;d marked something
      for Mutimer. I&rsquo;m to pass the paper on to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose this is the same woman&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think it&rsquo;s true?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True? Why, of course it is. A newspaper with a reputation to support
      can&rsquo;t go printing people&rsquo;s names at haphazard. Keene&rsquo;s very thick with all
      the London actors. He told me some first-class stories about&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; interposed his mother. &lsquo;Well, to think it should come to
      this! I&rsquo;m sure I feel for poor Mrs. Eldon. Really there is no end to her
      misfortunes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just how such families always end up,&rsquo; observed Alfred complacently. &lsquo;No
      doubt he&rsquo;ll drink himself to death, or something of that kind, and then we
      shall have the pleasure of seeing a new tablet in the church, inscribed
      with manifold virtues; or even a stained-glass window: the last of the
      Eldons deserves something noteworthy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it&rsquo;s hardly a subject for joking, Alfred. It is very, very sad.
      And to think what a fine handsome boy he used to be! But he was always
      dreadfully self-willed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was always an impertinent puppy! How he&rsquo;ll play the swell on his
      wife&rsquo;s earnings! Oh, our glorious aristocracy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham went early to her daughter&rsquo;s room. Adela was sitting with her
      Bible before her&mdash;had sat so since coming upstairs, yet had not read
      three consecutive verses. Her face showed no effect of tears, for the heat
      of a consuming suspense had dried the fountains of woe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like to occupy your mind with such things, my dear,&rsquo; began her
      mother, &lsquo;but perhaps as a warning I ought to show you the news Alfred
      spoke of. It pleases Providence that there should be evil in the world,
      and for our own safety we must sometimes look it in the face, especially
      we poor women, Adela. Will you read that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela read. She could not criticise the style, but it affected her as
      something unclean; Hubert&rsquo;s very name suffered degradation when used in
      such a way. Prepared for worse things than that which she saw, no shock of
      feelings was manifest in her. She returned the paper without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wanted you to see that my behaviour to Mr. Eldon was not unjustified,&rsquo; 
      said her mother. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t blame me any longer, dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have never blamed you, mother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a sad, sad end to what might have been a life of usefulness and
      honour. I have thought so often of the parable of the talents; only I fear
      this case is worse. His poor mother! I wonder if I could write to her! Yet
      I hardly know how to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is this a&mdash;a wicked woman, mother?&rsquo; Adela asked falteringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham shook her head and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My love, don&rsquo;t you see that she is an actress?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if all actresses are wicked, how is it that really good people go to
      the theatre?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid they oughtn&rsquo;t to. The best of us are tempted into thoughtless
      pleasure. But now I don&rsquo;t want you to brood over things which it is a sad
      necessity to have to glance at. Read your chapter, darling, and get to
      bed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To bed&mdash;but not to sleep. The child&rsquo;s imagination was aflame. This
      scarlet woman, this meteor from hell flashing before the delighted eyes of
      men, she, then, had bound Hubert for ever in her toils; no release for him
      now, no ransom to eternity. No instant&rsquo;s doubt of the news came to Adela;
      in her eyes <i>imprimatur</i> was the guarantee of truth. She strove to
      picture the face which had drawn Hubert to his doom. It must be lovely
      beyond compare. For the first time in her life she knew the agonies of
      jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not shed tears, but in her anguish she fell upon prayer, spoke
      the words above her breath that they might silence that terrible voice
      within. Poor lost lamb, crying in the darkness, sending forth such piteous
      utterance as might create a spirit of love to hear and rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rescue&mdash;none. When the fire wasted itself, she tried to find solace
      in the thought that one source of misery was stopped. Hubert was married,
      or would be very soon, and if she had sinned in loving him till now, such
      sin would henceforth be multiplied incalculably; she durst not, as she
      valued her soul, so much as let his name enter her thoughts. And to guard
      against it, was there not a means offered her? The doubt as to what love
      meant was well-nigh solved; or at all events she held it proved that the
      &lsquo;love&rsquo; of the marriage service was something she had never yet felt,
      something which would follow upon marriage itself. Earthly love had surely
      led Hubert Eldon to ruin; oh, not that could be demanded of her! What
      reason had she now to offer against her mother&rsquo;s desire? Letty&rsquo;s arguments
      were vain; they were but as the undisciplined motions of her own heart.
      Marriage with a worthy man must often have been salvation to a rudderless
      life; for was it not the <i>ceremony</i> which, after all, constituted the
      exclusive sanction?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer, it was true, fell sadly short of her ideal of goodness. He was an
      unbeliever. But might not this very circumstance involve a duty? As his
      wife, could she not plead with him and bring him to the truth? Would not
      that be <i>loving</i> him, to make his spiritual good the end of her
      existence? It was as though a great light shot athwart her darkness. She
      raised herself in bed, and, as if with her very hands, clung to the
      inspiration which had been granted her. The light was not abiding, but
      something of radiance lingered, and that must stead her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother returned to Belwick next morning after an early breakfast. He
      was in his wonted high spirits, and talked with much satisfaction of the
      acquaintances he had made on the previous day, while Adela waited upon
      him. Mrs. Waltham only appeared as he was setting off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela sat almost in silence whilst her mother breakfasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t look well, dear?&rsquo; said the latter, coming to the little room
      upstairs soon after the meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I am well, mother. But I want to speak to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham seated herself in expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you tell me why you so much wish me to marry Mr. Mutimer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela&rsquo;s tone was quite other than she had hitherto used in conversations
      of this kind. It was submissive, patiently questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t misunderstand me,&rsquo; replied the mother with some nervousness.
      &lsquo;The wish, dear, must of course be yours as well. You know that I&mdash;that
      I really have left you to consult your own&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The sentence was unfinished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you have tried to persuade me, mother dear,&rsquo; pursued the gentle
      voice. &lsquo;You would not do so if you did not think it for my good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Something shot painfully through Mrs. Waltham&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure I have thought so, Adela; really I have thought so. I know
      there are objections, but no marriage is in every way perfect. I feel so
      sure of his character&mdash;I mean of his character in a worldly sense.
      And you might do so much to&mdash;to show him the true way, might you not,
      darling? I&rsquo;m sure his heart is good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham also was speaking with less confidence than on former
      occasions. She cast side glances at her daughter&rsquo;s colourless face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother, may I marry without feeling that&mdash;that I love him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The face was flushed now for a moment. Adela had never spoken that word to
      anyone; even to Letty she had scarcely murmured it. The effect upon her of
      hearing it from her own lips was mysterious, awful; the sound did not die
      with her voice, but trembled in subtle harmonies along the chords of her
      being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother took the shaken form and drew it to her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he is your husband, darling, you will find that love grows. It is
      always so. Have no fear. On his side there is not only love; he respects
      you deeply; he has told me so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you encourage me to accept him, mother? It is your desire? I am your
      child, and you can wish nothing that is not for my good. Guide me, mother.
      It is so hard to judge for myself. You shall decide for me, indeed you
      shall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother&rsquo;s heart was wrung. For a moment she strove to speak the very
      truth, to utter a word about that love which Adela was resolutely
      excluding. But the temptation to accept this unhoped surrender proved too
      strong. She sobbed her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I do wish it, Adela. You will find that I&mdash;that I was not
      wrong.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then if he asks me, I will marry him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As those words were spoken Mutimer issued from the Manor gates, uncertain
      whether to go his usual way down to the works or to pay a visit to Mrs.
      Waltham. The latter purpose prevailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening before, Mr. Willis Rodman had called at the Manor shortly
      after dinner. He found Mutimer smoking, with coffee at his side, and was
      speedily making himself comfortable in the same way. Then he drew a
      newspaper from his pocket. &lsquo;Have you seen the &ldquo;Belwick Chronicle&rdquo; of
      to-day?&rsquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why the deuce should I read such a paper?&rsquo; exclaimed Richard, with
      good-humoured surprise. He was in excellent spirits to-night, the
      excitement of the day having swept his mind clear of anxieties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s something in it, though, that you ought to see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed out the paragraph relating to Eldon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keene&rsquo;s writing, eh?&rsquo; said Mutimer thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he gave me the paper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard rekindled his cigar with deliberation, and stood for a few moments
      with one foot on the fender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is the woman?&rsquo; he then asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know her name. Of course it&rsquo;s the same story continued.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And concluded.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rsquo; said the other, smiling and shaking his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This may or may not be true, I suppose,&rsquo; was Richard&rsquo;s next remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I suppose the man hears all that kind of thing. I don&rsquo;t see any
      reason to doubt it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I keep the paper?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes. Keene told me, by-the-by, that he gave a copy to young Waltham.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rodman spoke whilst rolling the cigar in his mouth. Mutimer allowed
      the subject to lapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no impossibility, no improbability even, in the statement made
      by the newspaper correspondent; yet as Richard thought it over in the
      night, he could not but regard it as singular that Mr. Keene should be the
      man to make public such a piece of information so very opportunely. He was
      far from having admitted the man to his confidence, but between Keene and
      Rodman, as he was aware, an intimacy had sprung up. It might be that one
      or the other had thought it worth while to serve him; why should Keene be
      particular to put a copy of the paper into Alfred Waltham&rsquo;s hands? Well,
      he personally knew nothing of the affair. If the news effected anything,
      so much the better. He hoped it might be trustworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among his correspondence in the morning was a letter from Emma Vine. He
      opened it last; anyone observing him would have seen with what reluctance
      he began to read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Richard,&rsquo; it ran, &lsquo;I write to thank you for the money. I would
      very much rather have had a letter from you, however short a one. It seems
      long since you wrote a real letter, and I can&rsquo;t think how long since I
      have seen you. But I know how full of business you are, dear, and I&rsquo;m sure
      you would never come to London without telling me, because if you hadn&rsquo;t
      time to come here, I should be only too glad to go to Highbury, if only
      for one word. We have got some mourning dresses to make for the servants
      of a lady in Islington, so that is good news. But poor Jane is very bad
      indeed. She suffers a great deal of pain, and most of all at night, so
      that she scarcely ever gets more than half-an-hour of sleep at a time, if
      that. What makes it worse, dear Richard, is that she is so very unhappy.
      Sometimes she cries nearly through the whole night. I try my best to keep
      her up, but I&rsquo;m afraid her weakness has much to do with it. But Kate is
      very well, I am glad to say, and the children are very well too. Bertie is
      beginning to learn to read. He often says he would like to see you. Thank
      you, dearest, for the money and all your kindness, and believe that I
      shall think of you every minute with much love. From yours ever and ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;EMMA VINE.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be cruel to reproduce Emma&rsquo;s errors of spelling. Richard had
      sometimes noted a bad instance with annoyance, but it was not that which
      made him hurry to the end this morning with lowered brows. When he had
      finished the letter he crumbled it up and threw it into the fire. It was
      not heartlessness that made him do so: he dreaded to have these letters
      brought before his eyes a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was also throwing the envelope aside, when he discovered that it
      contained yet another slip of paper. The writing on this was not Emma&rsquo;s:
      the letters were cramped and not easy to decipher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Richard, come to London and see me. I want to speak to you, I must
      speak to you. I can&rsquo;t have very long to live, and I <i>must</i>, <i>must</i>
      see you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;JANE VINE.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This too he threw into the fire. His lips were hard set, his eyes wide.
      And almost immediately he prepared to leave the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was early, but he felt that he must go to the Walthams&rsquo;. He had
      promised Mrs. Waltham to refrain from visiting the house for a week, but
      that promise it was impossible to keep. Jane&rsquo;s words were ringing in his
      ears: he seemed to hear her very voice calling and beseeching. So far from
      changing his purpose, it impelled him in the course he had chosen. There
      must and should be an end of this suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham had just come downstairs from her conversation with Adela,
      when she saw Mutimer approaching the door. She admitted him herself.
      Surely Providence was on her side; she felt almost young in her
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard remained in the house about twenty minutes. Then he walked down to
      the works as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after his departure another visitor presented himself. This was
      Mr. Wyvern. The vicar&rsquo;s walk in Hubert&rsquo;s company the evening before had
      extended itself from point to point, till the two reached Agworth
      together. Mr. Wyvern was addicted to night-rambling, and he often covered
      considerable stretches of country in the hours when other mortals slept.
      To-night he was in the mood for such exercise; it worked off unwholesome
      accumulations of thought and feeling, and good counsel often came to him
      in what the Greeks called the kindly time. He did not hurry on his way
      back to Wanley, for just at present he was much in need of calm
      reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his arrival at the Vicarage about eleven o&rsquo;clock the servant informed
      him of Miss Waltham&rsquo;s having called. Mr. Wyvern heard this with pleasure.
      He thought at first of writing a note to Adela, begging her to come to the
      Vicarage again, but by the morning he had decided to be himself the
      visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gathered at once from Mrs. Waltham&rsquo;s face that events of some agitating
      kind were in progress. She did not keep him long in uncertainty. Upon his
      asking if he might speak a few words with Adela, Mrs. Waltham examined him
      curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that I must ask you to excuse her this morning,
      Mr. Wyvern. She is not quite prepared to see anyone at present. In fact,&rsquo; 
      she lowered her voice and smiled very graciously, &lsquo;she has just had an&mdash;an
      agitating interview with Mr. Mutimer&mdash;she has consented to be his
      wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In that case I cannot of course trouble her,&rsquo; the vicar replied, with
      gravity which to Mrs. Waltham appeared excessive, rather adapted to news
      of a death than of a betrothal. The dark searching eyes, too, made her
      feel uncomfortable. And he did not utter a syllable of the politeness
      expected on these occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a very shocking thing about Mr. Eldon!&rsquo; the lady pursued. &lsquo;You have
      heard?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shocking? Pray, what has happened?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert had left him in some depression the night before, and for a moment
      Mr. Wyvern dreaded lest some fatality had become known in Wanley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, you have not heard? It is in this newspaper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar examined the column indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But,&rsquo; he exclaimed, with subdued indignation, &lsquo;this is the merest
      falsehood!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A falsehood! Are you sure of that, Mr. Wyvern?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perfectly sure. There is no foundation for it whatsoever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t say so! I am very glad to hear that, for poor Mrs. Eldon&rsquo;s
      sake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Could you lend me this newspaper for to-day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With pleasure. Really you relieve me, Mr. Wyvern. I had no means of
      inquiring into the story, of course. But how disgraceful that such a thing
      should appear in print!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry to say, Mrs. Waltham, that the majority of things which appear
      in print nowadays are more or less disgraceful. However, this may claim
      prominence, in its way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I may safely contradict it? It will be such a happiness to do so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Contradict it by all means, madam. You may cite me as your authority.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar crushed the sheet into his pocket and strode homewards.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the church of the Insurgents there are many orders. To rise to the
      supreme passion of revolt, two conditions are indispensable: to possess
      the heart of a poet, and to be subdued by poverty to the yoke of ignoble
      labour. But many who fall short of the priesthood have yet a share of the
      true spirit, bestowed upon them by circumstances of birth and education,
      developed here and there by the experience of life, yet rigidly limited in
      the upshot by the control of material ease, the fatal lordship of the
      comfortable commonplace. Of such was Hubert Eldon. In him, despite his
      birth and breeding, there came to the surface a rich vein of independence,
      obscurely traceable, no doubt, in the characters of certain of his
      ancestors, appearing at length where nineteenth-century influences had
      thinned the detritus of convention and class prejudice. His nature
      abounded in contradictions, and as yet self-study&mdash;in itself the note
      of a mind striving for emancipation&mdash;had done little for him beyond
      making clear the manifold difficulties strewn in his path of progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      You know already that it was no vulgar instinct of sensuality which had
      made severance between him and the respectable traditions of his family.
      Observant friends naturally cast him in the category of young men whom the
      prospect of a fortune seduces to a life of riot; his mother had no means
      of forming a more accurate judgment. Mr. Wyvern alone had seen beneath the
      surface, aided by a liberal study of the world, and no doubt also by that
      personal sympathy which is so important an ally of charity and truth. Mr.
      Wyvern&rsquo;s early life had not been in smooth waters; in him too revolt was
      native, tempered also by spiritual influences of the most opposite kind.
      He felt a deep interest in the young man, and desired to keep him in view.
      It was the first promise of friendship that had been held out to Hubert,
      who already suffered from a sense of isolation, and was wondering in what
      class of society he would have to look for his kith and kin. Since boyhood
      he had drawn apart to a great extent from the companionships which most
      readily offered. The turn taken by the circumstances of his family
      affected the pride which was one of his strongest characteristics; his
      house had fallen, and it seemed to him that a good deal of pity, if not of
      contempt, mingled with his reception by the more fortunate of his own
      standing. He had never overcome a natural hostility to old Mr. Mutimer:
      the <i>bourgeois</i> virtues of the worthy ironmaster rather irritated
      than attracted him, and he suffered intensely in the thought that his
      mother brought herself to close friendship with one so much her inferior
      just for the sake of her son&rsquo;s future. In this matter he judged with
      tolerable accuracy. Mrs. Eldon, finding in the old man a certain
      unexpected refinement over and above his goodness of heart, consciously or
      unconsciously encouraged herself in idealising him, that the way of
      interest might approach as nearly as might be to that of honour. Hubert,
      with no understanding for the craggy facts of life, inwardly rebelled
      against the whole situation. He felt that it laid him open to ridicule,
      the mere suspicion of which always stung him to the quick. When,
      therefore, he declared to his mother, in the painful interview on his
      return to Wanley, that it was almost a relief to him to have lost the
      inheritance, he spoke with perfect truth. Amid the tempest which had
      fallen on his life there rose in that moment the semblance of a star of
      hope. The hateful conditions which had weighed upon his future being
      finally cast off, might he not look forward to some nobler activity than
      had hitherto seemed possible? Was he not being saved from his meaner self,
      that part of his nature which tended to conventional ideals, which was
      subject to empty pride and ignoble apprehensions? Had he gone through the
      storm without companion, hope might have overcome every weakness, but
      sympathy with his mother&rsquo;s deep distress troubled his self-control. At her
      feet he yielded to the emotions of childhood, and his misery increased
      until bodily suffering brought him the relief of unconsciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his mother perhaps he owed that strain of idealism which gave his
      character its significance. In Mrs. Eldon it affected only the inner life;
      in Hubert spiritual strivings naturally sought the outlet of action. That
      his emancipation should declare itself in some exaggerated way was quite
      to be expected: impatience of futilities and insincerities made common
      cause with the fiery spirit of youth and spurred him into reckless pursuit
      of that abiding rapture which is the dream and the despair of the earth&rsquo;s
      purest souls. The pistol bullet checked his course, happily at the right
      moment. He had gone far enough for experience and not too far for
      self-recovery. The wise man in looking back upon his endeavours regrets
      nothing of which that can be said.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the side of a passion such as that which had opened Hubert&rsquo;s
      intellectual manhood, the mild, progressive attachments sanctioned by
      society show so colourless as to suggest illusion. Thinking of Adela
      Waltham as he lay recovering from his illness, he found it difficult to
      distinguish between the feelings associated with her name and those which
      he had owed to other maidens of the same type. A week or two at Wanley
      generally resulted in a conviction that he was in love with Adela; and had
      Adela been entirely subject to her mother&rsquo;s influences, had she fallen but
      a little short of the innocence and delicacy which were her own, whether
      for happiness or the reverse, she would doubtless have been pledged to
      Hubert long ere this. The merest accident had in truth prevented it. At
      home for Christmas, the young man had made up his mind to speak and claim
      her: he postponed doing so till he should have returned from a visit to a
      college friend in the same county. His friend had a sister, five or six
      years older than Adela, and of a warmer type of beauty, with the finished
      graces of the town. Hubert found himself once more without guidance, and
      so left Wanley behind him, journeying to an unknown land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert could not remember a time when he had not been in love. The objects
      of his devotion had succeeded each other rapidly, but each in her turn was
      the perfect woman. His imagination cast a halo about a beautiful head, and
      hastened to see in its possessor all the poetry of character which he
      aspired to worship. In his loves, as in every other circumstance of life,
      he would have nothing of compromise; for him the world contained nothing
      but his passion, and existence had no other end. Between that past and
      this present more intervened than Hubert could yet appreciate; but he
      judged the change in himself by the light in which that early love
      appeared to him. Those were the restless ardours of boyhood: he could not
      henceforth trifle so with solemn meanings. The ideal was harder of
      discovery than he had thought; perhaps it was not to be found in the world
      at all. But what less perfect could henceforth touch his heart?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet throughout his convalescence he thought often of Adela, perhaps
      because she was so near, and because she doubtless often thought of him.
      His unexpected meeting with her on Stanbury Hill affected him strangely:
      the world was new to his eyes, and the girl&rsquo;s face seemed to share in the
      renewal; it was not quite the same face that he had held in memory, but
      had a fresh significance. He read in her looks more than formerly he had
      been able to see. This impression was strengthened by his interview with
      her on the following day. Had she too grown much older in a few months?
    </p>
    <p>
      After spending a fortnight with his mother at Agworth, he went to London,
      and for a time thought as little of Adela as of any other woman. New
      interests claimed him, interests purely intellectual, the stronger that
      his mind seemed just aroused from a long sleep. He threw himself into
      various studies with more zeal than he had hitherto devoted to such
      interests; not that he had as yet any definite projects, but solely
      because it was his nature to be in pursuit of some excellence and to scorn
      mere acquiescence in a life of every-day colour. He lived all but in
      loneliness, and when the change had had time to work upon him his thoughts
      began to revert to Adela, to her alone of those who stood on the other
      side of the gulf. She came before his eyes as a vision of purity; it was
      soothing to picture her face and to think of her walking in the spring
      meadows. He thought of her as of a white rose, dew-besprent, and gently
      swayed by the sweet air of a sunny morning; a white rose newly spread, its
      heart virgin from the hands of shaping Nature. He could not decide what
      quality, what absence of thought, made Adela so distinct to him. Was it
      perhaps the exquisite delicacy apparent in all she did or said? Even the
      most reverent thought seemed gross in touching her; the mind flitted round
      about her, kept from contact by a supreme modesty, which she alone could
      inspire If her head were painted, it must be against the tenderest eastern
      sky; all associations with her were of the morning, when heatless rays
      strike level across the moist earth, of simple devoutness which renders
      thanks for the blessing of a new day, of mercy robed like the zenith at
      dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      His study just now was of the early Italians, in art and literature. There
      was more of Adela than he perceived in the impulse which guided him in
      that direction. When he came to read the &lsquo;Vita Nuova,&rsquo; it was of Adela
      expressly that he thought. The poet&rsquo;s passion of worship entered his
      heart; transferring his present feeling to his earlier self, he grew to
      regard his recent madness as a lapse from the true love of his life. He
      persuaded himself that he had loved Adela in a far more serious way than
      any of the others who from time to time had been her rivals, and that the
      love was now returning to him, strengthened and exalted. He began to write
      sonnets in Dante&rsquo;s manner, striving to body forth in words the new piety
      which illumined his life. Whereas love had been to him of late a
      glorification of the senses, he now cleansed himself from what he deemed
      impurity and adored in mere ecstasy of the spirit. Adela soon became
      rather a symbol than a living woman; he identified her with the ends to
      which his life darkly aspired, and all but convinced himself that memory
      and imagination would henceforth suffice to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the autumn he went down to Agworth, and spent a few days with his
      mother. The temptation to walk over to Wanley and call upon the Walthams
      proved too strong to be resisted. His rejection at their door was rather a
      shock than a surprise; it had never occurred to him that the old friendly
      relations had been in any way disturbed; he explained Mrs. Waltham&rsquo;s
      behaviour by supposing that his silence had offended her, and perhaps his
      failure to take leave of her before quitting Wanley. Possibly she thought
      he had dealt lightly with Adela. Offence on purely moral grounds did not
      even suggest itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to London anxious and unhappy. The glimpse of Adela sitting at
      the window had brought him back to reality; after all it was no
      abstraction that had become the constant companion of his solitude; his
      love was far more real for that moment&rsquo;s vision of the golden head, and
      had a very real power of afflicting him with melancholy. He faltered in
      his studies, and once again had lost the motive to exertion. Then came the
      letter from his mother, telling of Adela&rsquo;s rumoured engagement. It caused
      him to set forth almost immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alternation of moods exhibited in his conversation with Mr. Wyvern
      continued to agitate him during the night. Now it seemed impossible to
      approach Adela in any way; now he was prepared to defy every consideration
      in order to save her and secure his own happiness. Then, after dwelling
      for awhile on the difficulties of his position, he tried to convince
      himself that once again he had been led astray after beauty and goodness
      which existed only in his imagination, that in losing Adela he only
      dismissed one more illusion. Such comfort was unsubstantial; he was, in
      truth, consumed in wretchedness at the thought that she once might easily
      have been his, and that he had passed her by. What matter whether we love
      a reality or a dream, if the love drive us to frenzy? Yet how could he
      renew his relations with her? Even if no actual engagement bound her, she
      must be prejudiced against him by stories which would make it seem an
      insult if he addressed her. And if the engagement really existed, what
      shadow of excuse had he for troubling her with his love?
    </p>
    <p>
      When he entered his mother&rsquo;s room in the morning, Mrs. Eldon took a small
      volume from the table at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I found this a few weeks ago among the books you left with me,&rsquo; she said.
      &lsquo;How long have you had it, Hubert?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a copy of the &lsquo;Christian Year,&rsquo; and writing on the fly-leaf showed
      that it belonged, or had once belonged, to Adela Waltham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert regarded it with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was lent to me a year ago,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I took it away with me. I had
      forgotten that I had it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstances under which it had been lent to him came back very
      clearly now. It was after that visit to his friend which had come so
      unhappily between him and Adela. When he went to bid her good-bye he found
      her alone, and she was reading this book. She spoke of it, and, in
      surprise that he had never read it, begged him to take it to Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have another copy,&rsquo; Adela said. &lsquo;You can return that any time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The time had only now come. Hubert resolved to take the book to Wanley in
      the evening; if no other means offered, Mr. Wyvern would return it to the
      owner. Might he enclose a note? Instead of that, he wrote out from memory
      two of his own sonnets, the best of those he had recently composed under
      the influence of the &lsquo;Vita Nuova,&rsquo; and shut them between the pages. Then
      he made the book into a parcel and addressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started for his walk at the same hour as on the evening before. There
      was frost in the air, and already the stars were bright. As he drew near
      to Wanley, the road was deserted; his footfall was loud on the hard earth.
      The moon began to show her face over the dark top of Stanbury Hill, and
      presently he saw by the clear rays that the figure of a woman was a few
      yards ahead of him; he was overtaking her. As he drew near to her, she
      turned her head. He knew her at once, for it was Letty Tew. He had been
      used to meet Letty often at the Walthams&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently he was himself recognised; the girl swerved a little, as if to
      let him pass, and kept her head bent. He obeyed an impulse and spoke to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid you have forgotten me, Miss Tew. Yet I don&rsquo;t like to pass you
      without saying a word.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought it was&mdash;the light makes it difficult&mdash;&rsquo; Letty
      murmured, sadly embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the moon is beautiful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very beautiful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They regarded it together. Letty could not help glancing at her companion,
      and as he did not turn his face she examined him for a moment or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going to see my friend Mr. Wyvern,&rsquo; Hubert proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few more remarks of the kind were exchanged, Letty by degrees summoning
      a cold confidence; then Hubert said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have here a book which belongs to Miss Waltham. She lent it to me a
      year ago, and I wish to return it. Dare I ask you to put it into her
      hands?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty knew what the book must be. Adela had told her of it at the time,
      and since had spoken of it once or twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, I will give it her,&rsquo; she replied, rather nervously again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you say that I would gladly have thanked her myself, if it had been
      possible?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Mr. Eldon, I will say that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in Hubert&rsquo;s voice seemed to cause Letty to raise her eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wish me to thank her?&rsquo; she added; inconsequently perhaps, but with a
      certain significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you will be so kind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert wanted to say more, but found it difficult to discover the right
      words. Letty, too, tried to shadow forth something that was in her mind,
      but with no better success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I remember,&rsquo; Hubert said, pausing in his walk, &lsquo;this stile will be my
      shortest way across to the Vicarage. Thank you much for your kindness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had raised his hat and was turning, but Letty impulsively put forth her
      hand. &lsquo;Good-bye,&rsquo; he said, in a friendly voice, as he took the little
      fingers. &lsquo;I wish the old days were back again, and we were going to have
      tea together as we used to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvern&rsquo;s face gave no promise of cheerful intelligence as he welcomed
      his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the origin of this, I wonder?&rsquo; he said, handing Hubert the
      &lsquo;Belwick Chronicle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of the young man&rsquo;s nerves was not well adapted to sustain fresh
      irritation. He turned pale with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is this going the round of Wanley?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Probably. I had it from Mrs. Waltham.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you contradict it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As emphatically as I could.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will see the man who edits this to-morrow,&rsquo; cried Hubert hotly. &lsquo;But
      perhaps he is too great a blackguard to talk with.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It purports to come, you see, from a London correspondent. But I suppose
      the source is nearer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean&mdash;you think that man Mutimer has originated it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I scarcely think that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yet it is more than likely. I will go to the Manor at once. At least he
      shall give me yes or no.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had started to his feet, but the vicar laid a hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t do that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Consider. You have no kind of right to charge him with such a thing. And
      there is another reason: he proposed to Miss Waltham this morning, and she
      accepted him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This morning? And this paper is yesterday&rsquo;s. Why, it makes it more likely
      than ever. How did they get the paper? Doubtless he sent it them. If she
      has accepted him this very day&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The repetition of the words seemed to force their meaning upon him through
      his anger. His voice failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You tell me that Adela Waltham has engaged herself to that man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her mother told me, only a few minutes after it occurred.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then it was this that led her to consent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely that is presupposing too much, my dear Eldon,&rsquo; said the vicar
      gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, not more than I know to be true. I could not say that to anyone but
      you; you must understand me. The girl is being cheated into marrying that
      fellow. Of her own free will she could not do it. This is one of
      numberless lies. You are right; it&rsquo;s no use to go to him: he wouldn&rsquo;t tell
      the truth. But <i>she</i> must be told. How can I see her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is more difficult than ever. Her having accepted him makes all the
      difference. Explain it to yourself as you may, you cannot give her to
      understand that you doubt her sincerity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But does she know that this story is false?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, that she will certainly hear. I have busied myself in contradicting
      it. If Mrs. Waltham does not tell her, she will hear it from her friend
      Miss Tew, without question.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert pondered, then made the inquiry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How could I procure a meeting with Miss Tew? I met her just now on the
      road and spoke to her. I think she might consent to help me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvern looked doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You met her? She was coming from Agworth?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She seemed to be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her father and mother are gone to spend to-morrow with friends in
      Belwick; I suppose she drove into Wanley with them, and walked back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar probably meant this for a suggestion; at all events, Hubert
      received it as one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I will simply call at the house. She may be alone. I can&rsquo;t weigh
      niceties.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvern made no reply. The announcement that dinner was ready allowed
      him to quit the subject. Hubert with difficulty sat through the meal, and
      as soon as it was over took his departure, leaving it uncertain whether he
      would return that evening. The vicar offered no further remark on the
      subject of their thoughts, but at parting pressed the young man&rsquo;s hand
      warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert walked straight to the Tews&rsquo; dwelling. The course upon which he had
      decided had disagreeable aspects and involved chances anything but
      pleasant to face; he had, however, abundance of moral courage, and his
      habitual scorn of petty obstacles was just now heightened by passionate
      feeling. He made his presence known at the house-door as though his visit
      were expected. Letty herself opened to him. It was Saturday night, and she
      thought the ring was Alfred Waltham&rsquo;s. Indeed she half uttered a few
      familiar words; then, recognising Hubert, she stood fixed in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you allow me to speak with you for a few moments, Miss Tew?&rsquo; Hubert
      said, with perfect self-possession. &lsquo;I ask your pardon for calling at this
      hour. My business is urgent; I have come without a thought of anything but
      the need of seeing you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you come in, Mr. Eldon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She led him into a room where there was no fire, and only one lamp burning
      low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s very cold here,&rsquo; she said, with extreme nervousness. &lsquo;The
      other room is occupied&mdash;my sister and the children; I hope you&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A little girl put in her face at the door, asking &lsquo;Is it Alfred?&rsquo; Letty
      hurried her away, closed the door, and, whilst lighting two candles on the
      mantelpiece, begged her visitor to seat himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you will allow me, I will stand,&rsquo; said Hubert. &lsquo;I scarcely know how to
      begin what I wish to say. It has reference to Miss Waltham. I wish to see
      her; I must, if she will let me, have an opportunity of speaking with her.
      But I have no direct means of letting her know my wish; doubtless you
      understand that. In my helplessness I have thought of you. Perhaps I am
      asking an impossibility. Will you&mdash;can you&mdash;repeat my words to
      Miss Waltham, and beg her to see me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty listened in sheer bewilderment. The position in which she found
      herself was so alarmingly novel, it made such a whirlpool in her quiet
      life, that it was all she could do to struggle with the throbbing of her
      heart and attempt to gather her thoughts. She did not even reflect that
      her eyes were fixed on Hubert&rsquo;s in a steady gaze. Only the sound of his
      voice after silence aided her to some degree of collectedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is every reason why you should accuse me of worse than
      impertinence,&rsquo; Hubert continued, less impulsively. &lsquo;I can only ask your
      forgiveness. Miss Waltham may very likely refuse to see me, but, if you
      would ask her&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty was borne on a torrent of strange thoughts. How could this man, who
      spoke with such impressive frankness, with such persuasiveness, be the
      abandoned creature that she had of late believed him? With Adela&rsquo;s secret
      warm in her heart she could not but feel an interest in Hubert, and the
      interest was becoming something like zeal on his behalf. During the past
      two hours her mind had been occupied with him exclusively; his words when
      he left her at the stile had sounded so good and tender that she began to
      question whether there was any truth at all in the evil things said about
      him. The latest story had just been declared baseless by no less an
      authority than the vicar, who surely was not a man to maintain friendship
      with a worthless profligate. What did it all mean? She had heard only half
      an hour ago of Adela&rsquo;s positive acceptance of Mutimer, and was wretched
      about it; secure in her own love-match, it was the mystery of mysteries
      that Adela should consent to marry a man she could scarcely endure. And
      here a chance of rescue seemed to be offering; was it not her plain duty
      to give what help she might?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have probably not seen her since I gave you the book?&rsquo; Hubert said,
      perceiving that Letty was quite at a loss for words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t seen her at all to-day,&rsquo; was the reply. &lsquo;Do you wish me to
      go to-night?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You consent to do me this great kindness?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty blushed. Was she not committing herself too hastily
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There cannot be any harm in giving your message,&rsquo; she said, half
      interrogatively, her timidity throwing itself upon Hubert&rsquo;s honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely no harm in that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But do you know that she&mdash;have you heard&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I know. She has accepted an offer of marriage. It was because I
      heard of it that I came to you. You are her nearest friend; you can speak
      to her as others would not venture to. I ask only for five minutes. I
      entreat her to grant me that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To add to her perturbation, Letty was in dread of hearing Alfred&rsquo;s ring at
      the door; she durst not prolong this interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will tell her,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;If I can, I will see her to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how can I hear the result? I am afraid to ask you&mdash;if you would
      write one line to me at Agworth? I am staying at my mother&rsquo;s house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He mentioned the address. Letty, who felt herself caught up above the
      world of common experiences and usages, gave her promise as a matter of
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall not try to thank you,&rsquo; Hubert said. &lsquo;But you will not doubt that
      I am grateful?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty said no more, and it was with profound relief that she heard the
      door close behind her visitor. But even yet the danger was not past;
      Alfred might at this moment be approaching, so as to meet Hubert near the
      house. And indeed this all but happened, for Mr. Waltham presented himself
      very soon. Letty had had time to impose secrecy on her sisters, such an
      extraordinary proceeding on her part that they were awed, and made
      faithful promise of discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty drew her lover into the fireless room; she had blown out the candles
      and turned the lamp low again, fearful lest her face should display signs
      calling for comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did so want you to come!&rsquo; she exclaimed. &lsquo;Tell me about Adela.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s anything to tell,&rsquo; was Alfred&rsquo;s stolid reply.
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s settled, that&rsquo;s all. I suppose it&rsquo;s all right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you speak as if you thought it mightn&rsquo;t be, Alfred?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t know that I did. Well, I haven&rsquo;t seen her since I got home. She&rsquo;s
      upstairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t I see her to-night? I do so want to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say she&rsquo;d be glad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what is it, my dear boy? I&rsquo;m sure you speak as if you weren&rsquo;t quite
      satisfied.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The mater says it&rsquo;s all right I suppose she knows.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you&rsquo;ve always been so anxious for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anxious? I haven&rsquo;t been anxious at all. But I dare say it&rsquo;s the wisest
      thing she could do. I like Mutimer well enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alfred, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s the proper husband for Adela.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not? There&rsquo;s not much chance that she&rsquo;ll get a better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred was manifestly less cheerful than usual. When Letty continued to
      tax him with it he grew rather irritable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go and talk to her yourself,&rsquo; he said at length. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;s all
      right. I don&rsquo;t pretend to understand her; there&rsquo;s so much religion mixed
      up with her doings, and I can&rsquo;t stand that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty shook her head and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a vile smell of candle smoke there is here!&rsquo; Alfred cried. &lsquo;And the
      room must be five or six degrees below zero. Let&rsquo;s go to the fire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I shall run over to Adela at once,&rsquo; said Letty, as she followed
      him into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right. Don&rsquo;t be vexed if she refuses to let you in. I&rsquo;ll stay here
      with the youngsters a bit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was that Alfred did feel a little uncomfortable this evening,
      and was not sorry to be away from the house for a short time. He was one
      of those young men who will pursue an end out of mere obstinacy, and who,
      through default of imaginative power, require an event to declare itself
      before they can appreciate the ways in which it will affect them. This
      marriage of his sister with a man of the working class had possibly, he
      now felt, other aspects than those which alone he had regarded whilst it
      was merely a matter for speculation. He was not seriously uneasy, but
      wished his mother had been somewhat less precipitate. Well, Adela could
      not be such a simpleton as to be driven entirely counter to her
      inclinations in an affair of so much importance. Girls were confoundedly
      hard to understand, in short; probably they existed for the purpose of
      keeping one mentally active.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty found Mrs. Waltham sitting alone, she too seemingly not in the best
      of spirits. There was something depressing in the stillness of the house.
      Mrs. Waltham had her volume of family prayers open before her; her
      handkerchief lay upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is naturally a little&mdash;a little fluttered,&rsquo; she said, speaking
      of Adela. &lsquo;I hoped you would look in. Try and make her laugh, my dear;
      that&rsquo;s all she wants.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl tripped softly upstairs, and softly knocked at Adela&rsquo;s door. At
      her &lsquo;May I come in?&rsquo; the door was opened. Letty examined her friend with
      surprise; in Adela&rsquo;s face there was no indication of trouble, rather the
      light of some great joy dwelt in her eyes. She embraced Letty tenderly.
      The two were as nearly as possible of the same age, but Letty had always
      regarded Adela in the light of an elder sister; that feeling was very
      strong in her just now, as well as a diffidence greater than she had known
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you happy, darling?&rsquo; she asked timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, dear, I am happy. I believe, I am sure, I have done right. Take your
      hat off; it&rsquo;s quite early. I&rsquo;ve just been reading the collect for
      to-morrow. It&rsquo;s one of those I have never quite understood, but I think
      it&rsquo;s clear to me now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They read over the prayer together, and spoke of it for a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you brought me?&rsquo; Adela asked at length, noticing a little
      parcel in the other&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a book I have been asked to give you. I shall have to explain. Do
      you remember lending someone your &ldquo;Christian Year&rdquo;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The smile left Adela&rsquo;s face, and the muscles of her mouth strung
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I remember,&rsquo; she replied coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As I was walking back from Agworth this afternoon, he overtook me on the
      road and asked me to return it to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela took the parcel and laid it aside. There was an awkward silence.
      Letty could not look up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was going to see Mr. Wyvern,&rsquo; she continued, as if anxious to lay
      stress on this. &lsquo;He seems to know Mr. Wyvern very well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes? You didn&rsquo;t miss Alfred, I hope. He went out a very short time ago.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I saw him. He stayed with the others. But I have something more to
      tell you, about&mdash;about him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About Alfred?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About Mr. Eldon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela looked at her friend with a grave surprise, much as a queen regards
      a favourite subject who has been over-bold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think we won&rsquo;t talk of him, Letty,&rsquo; she said from her height.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do forgive me, Adela. I have promised toto say something. There must have
      been a great many things said that were not true, just like this about his
      marriage; I am so sure of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela endeavoured to let the remark pass without replying to it. But her
      thought expressed itself involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His marriage? What do you know of it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Wyvern came to see mother this morning, and showed her a newspaper
      that your mother gave him. It said that Mr. Eldon was going to marry an
      actress, and Mr. Wyvern declared there was not a word of truth in it. But
      of course your mother told you that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela sat motionless. Mrs. Waltham had not troubled herself to make known
      the vicar&rsquo;s contradiction. But Adela could not allow herself to admit
      that. Binding her voice with difficulty, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It does not at all concern me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But your mother <i>did</i> tell you, Adela?&rsquo; Letty persisted, emboldened
      by a thought which touched upon indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course she did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The falsehood was uttered with cold deliberateness. There was nothing to
      show that a pang quivered on every nerve of the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who can have sent such a thing to the paper?&rsquo; Letty exclaimed. &lsquo;There
      must be someone who wishes to do him harm. Adela, I don&rsquo;t believe <i>anything</i>
      that people have said!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in speaking she was frightened at her own boldness. Adela&rsquo;s eyes had
      never regarded her with such a look as now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Adela, my darling! Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t be angry with me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang forward and tried to put her arms about her friend, but Adela
      gently repelled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you have promised to say something, Letty, you must keep your promise.
      Will you say it at once, and then let us talk of something else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty checked a tear. Her trustful and loving friend seemed changed to
      someone she scarcely knew. She too grew colder, and began her story in a
      lifeless way, as if it no longer possessed any interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just when I had had tea and was expecting Alfred to come, somebody rang
      the bell. I went to the door myself, and it was Mr. Eldon. He had come to
      speak to me of you. He said he wanted to see you, that he <i>must</i> see
      you, and begged me to tell you that. That&rsquo;s all, Adela. I couldn&rsquo;t refuse
      him; I felt I had no right to; he spoke in such a way. But I am very sorry
      to have so displeased you, dear. I didn&rsquo;t think you would take anything
      amiss that I did in all sincerity. I am sure there has been some wretched
      mistake, something worse than a mistake, depend upon it. But I won&rsquo;t say
      any more. And I think I&rsquo;ll go now, Adela.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela spoke in a tone of measured gravity which was quite new in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have not displeased me, Letty. I don&rsquo;t think you have been to blame
      in any way; I am sure you had no choice but to do as he asked you. You
      have repeated all he said?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, all; all the words, that is. There was something that I can&rsquo;t
      repeat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if I consented to see him, how was he to know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I promised to write to him. He is staying at Agworth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t do that, dear. I will write to him myself, then I can thank
      him for returning the book. What is his address?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty gave it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is, of course, impossible for me to see him,&rsquo; pursued Adela, still in
      the same measured tones. &lsquo;If I write myself it will save you any more
      trouble. Forget it, if I seemed unkind, dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Adela, I can&rsquo;t forget it. You are not like yourself, not at all. Oh, how
      I wish this had happened sooner! Why, why can&rsquo;t you see him, darling? I
      think you ought to; I do really think so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must be the best judge of that, Letty. Please let us speak of it no
      more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The sweet girl-face was adamant, its expression a proud virginity; an
      ascetic sternness moulded the small, delicate lips. Letty&rsquo;s countenance
      could never have looked like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to herself again, Adela took the parcel upon her lap and sat
      dreaming. It was long before her face relaxed; when it did so, the mood
      that succeeded was profoundly sorrowful. One would have said that it was
      no personal grief that absorbed her, but compassion for the whole world&rsquo;s
      misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at length she undid the wrapping, her eye was at once caught by the
      papers within the volume. She started, and seemed afraid to touch the
      book. Her first thought was that Eldon had enclosed a letter; but she saw
      that there was no envelope, only two or three loose slips. At length she
      examined them and found the sonnets. They had no heading, but at the foot
      of each was written the date of composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      She read them. Adela&rsquo;s study of poetry had not gone beyond a school-book
      of selections, with the works of Mrs. Hemans and of Longfellow, and the
      &lsquo;Christian Year.&rsquo; Hubert&rsquo;s verses she found difficult to understand; their
      spirit, the very vocabulary, was strange to her. Only on a second reading
      did she attain a glimmering of their significance. Then she folded them
      again and laid them on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before going to her bedroom she wrote this letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;DEAR MR. ELDON,&mdash;I am much obliged to you for returning the
      &ldquo;Christian Year.&rdquo; Some papers were left in its pages by accident, and I
      now enclose them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Tew also brought me a message from you. I am sorry that I cannot do
      as you wish. I am unable to ask you to call, and I hope you will
      understand me when I say that any other kind of meeting is impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am, yours truly, &lsquo;ADELA WALTHAM.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Adela&rsquo;s first essay in this vein of composition. The writing cost
      her an hour, and she was far from satisfied with the final form. But she
      copied it in a firm hand, and made it ready for posting on the morrow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Between Richard Mutimer, bachelor, and Adela Marian Waitham, spinster,
      both of this parish&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the only announcement of the kind that Mr. Wyvern had to make this
      Sunday. To one of his hearers he seemed to utter the names with excessive
      emphasis, his deep voice reverberating in the church. The pews were high;
      Adela almost cowered in her corner, feeling pierced with the eyes, with
      the thoughts too, of the congregation about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had wondered whether the Manor pew would be occupied to-day, but it
      was not. When she stood up, her eyes strayed towards it; the red curtains
      which concealed the interior were old and faded, the wooden canopy crowned
      it with dreary state. In three weeks that would be her place at service.
      Sitting there, it would not be hard to keep her thoughts on mortality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would it not have been graceful in him to attend church to-day? Would she
      in future worship under the canopy alone?
    </p>
    <p>
      No time had been lost. Mr. Wyvern received notice of the proposed marriage
      less than two hours after Adela had spoken her world-changing
      monosyllable. She put in no plea for delay, and her mother, though
      affecting a little consternation at Mutimer&rsquo;s haste, could not seriously
      object. Wanley, discussing the matter at its Sunday tea-tables, declared
      with unanimity that such expedition was indecent. By this time the
      disapproval of the village had attached itself exclusively to Mrs.
      Waltham; Adela was spoken of as a martyr to her mother&rsquo;s miserable
      calculations. Mrs. Mewling went about with a story, that only by physical
      restraint had the unhappy girl been kept from taking flight. The name of
      Hubert Eldon once more came up in conversation. There was an
      unauthenticated rumour that he had been seen of late, lurking about
      Wanley. The more boldly speculative gossips looked with delicious
      foreboding to the results of a marriage such as this. Given a young man of
      Eldon&rsquo;s reputation&mdash;ah me!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Walthams all lunched (or dined) at the Manor. Mutimer was in high
      spirits, or seemed so; there were moments when the cheerful look died on
      his face, and his thoughts wandered from the conversation; but if his eye
      fell on Adela he never failed to smile the smile of inner satisfaction.
      She had not yet responded to his look, and only answered his questions in
      the briefest words; but her countenance was resolutely bright, and her
      beauty all that man could ask. Richard did not flatter himself that she
      held him dear; indeed, he was a good deal in doubt whether affection, as
      vulgarly understood, was consistent with breeding and education. But that
      did not concern him; he had gained his end, and was jubilant.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the meal he mentioned that his sister would come down
      from London in a day or two. Christmas was only a week off, and he had
      thought it would be pleasant to have her at the Manor for that season.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s very nice!&rsquo; assented Mrs. Waltham. &lsquo;Alice, her name is, didn&rsquo;t
      you say? Is she dark or fair?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fair, and just about Adela&rsquo;s height, I should think. I hope you&rsquo;ll like
      her, Adela.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was unfortunate that Richard did not pronounce the name of his bride
      elect quite as it sounds on cultured lips. This may have been partly the
      result of diffidence; but there was a slurring of the second syllable
      disagreeably suggestive of vulgarity. It struck on the girl&rsquo;s nerves, and
      made it more difficult for her to grow accustomed to this form of address
      from Mutimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I shall try to,&rsquo; she replied to the remark about Alice, this
      time endeavouring to fix her obstinate eyes for a moment on Richard&rsquo;s
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your brother won&rsquo;t come, then?&rsquo; Mrs. Waltham asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not just yet, I&rsquo;m afraid. He&rsquo;s busy studying.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To read and write, I fear,&rsquo; was the lady&rsquo;s silent comment. On the score
      of Alice, too, Mrs. Waltham nursed a certain anxiety. The damsels of the
      working class are, or so she apprehended, somewhat more difficult of
      acceptance than their fathers and brothers, and for several reasons. An
      artisan does not necessarily suggest, indeed is very distinct from, the
      footman or even groom; but to dissociate an uneducated maiden from the
      lower regions of the house is really an exertion of the mind. And then, it
      is to be feared, the moral tone of such young persons leaves for the most
      part much to be desired. Mrs. Waltham was very womanly in her distrust of
      her sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      After luncheon there was an inspection of the house. Adela did not go
      farther than the drawing-room; her brother remained with her whilst
      Mutimer led Mrs. Waltham through the chambers she might care to see. The
      lady expressed much satisfaction. The furnishing had been performed in a
      substantial manner, without display; one might look forward to
      considerable comfort at the Manor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any change that Adela suggests,&rsquo; said Richard during this tour, &lsquo;shall of
      course be carried out at once. If she doesn&rsquo;t like the paper in any of the
      rooms, she&rsquo;s only got to say so and choose a better. Do you think she&rsquo;d
      care to look at the stables? I&rsquo;ll get a carriage for her, and a horse to
      ride, if she likes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard felt strongly that this was speaking in a generous way. He was not
      aware that his tone hinted as much, but it unmistakably did. The vulgarity
      of a man who tries hard not to be vulgar is always particularly
      distressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, how kind!&rsquo; murmured Mrs. Waltham. &lsquo;Adela has never ridden; I should
      think carriage exercise would be enough for her. We mustn&rsquo;t forget your
      principles, you know, for I&rsquo;m sure they are very admirable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t care anything about luxuries myself, but Adela shall have
      everything she wants.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred Waltham, who knew the house perfectly, led his mother to inspect
      the stables, Mutimer remaining with Adela in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been very quiet all dinner-time,&rsquo; he said, taking a seat near her
      and bending forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A little, perhaps. I am thinking of so many things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are they, I wonder?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you let me have some books about Socialism, and the other questions
      in which you are interested?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think I will! You really mean to study these things?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I will read and think about them. And I shall be glad if you will
      explain to me more about the works. I have never quite understood all that
      you wish to do. Perhaps you will have time when you come to see us some
      evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, if I haven&rsquo;t time, I&rsquo;ll make it,&rsquo; said Richard, laughing. &lsquo;You
      can&rsquo;t think how glad I am to hear you say this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When do you expect your sister?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On Tuesday; at least, I hope it won&rsquo;t be later. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll like her,
      you can&rsquo;t help. She hasn&rsquo;t such looks as you have, you know, but we&rsquo;ve
      always thought her very fair-looking. What do you think we often call her?
      The Princess! That&rsquo;s part because of her name, Alice Maud, and part from a
      sort of way she&rsquo;s always had. Not a flighty way, but a sort of&mdash;well,
      I can&rsquo;t describe it. I do hope you&rsquo;ll like her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time Adela had heard him speak in a tone which impressed
      her as entirely honest, not excepting his talk of the Propaganda. Here,
      she felt, was a side of his character that she had not suspected. His
      voice was almost tender; the play of his features betokened genuine
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can see she is a great favourite with you,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;I have no
      doubt I shall like her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find a good deal that wants altering, I&rsquo;ve no doubt,&rsquo; he pursued,
      now quite forgetful of himself. &lsquo;She hasn&rsquo;t had much education, you know,
      till just lately. But you&rsquo;ll help her in that, won&rsquo;t you? She&rsquo;s as
      good-natured as any girl living, and whenever you put her right you may be
      sure she&rsquo;ll only thank you. I&rsquo;ve wanted to have her here before, only I
      thought I&rsquo;d wait till I knew whether&mdash;you know what I mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if in a sudden gloom before her eyes Adela saw his face draw nearer. It
      was a moment&rsquo;s loss of consciousness, in which a ghastly fear flashed upon
      her soul. Then, with lips that quivered, she began to talk quickly of
      Socialism, just to dispel the horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following afternoon Mutimer came, bringing a number of books,
      pamphlets, and newspapers. Mrs. Waltham had discreetly abandoned the
      sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to frighten you,&rsquo; he said, laying down his bundle. &lsquo;You
      haven&rsquo;t got to read through all these. I was up nearly all last night
      marking pages that I thought you&rsquo;d better study first of all. And here&rsquo;s a
      lot of back numbers of the &ldquo;Fiery Cross;&rdquo; I should like you to read all
      that&rsquo;s signed by Mr. Westlake; he&rsquo;s the editor, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there anything here of your own writing?&rsquo; Adela inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t written anything. I&rsquo;ve kept to lecturing; it comes easier
      to me. After Christmas I shall have several lectures to give in London.
      Perhaps you&rsquo;ll come and hear me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, of course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you can get to know Mrs. Westlake, I dare say. She&rsquo;s a lady, you
      know, like yourself. There&rsquo;s some poetry by her in the paper; it just has
      her initials, &ldquo;S. W.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s with us heart and soul, as you&rsquo;ll see by her
      writing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Alice a Socialist?&rsquo; Adela asked, after glancing fitfully at the
      papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s a princess; it would be too much to expect Socialism of her.
      But I dare say she&rsquo;ll be beginning to think more now. I don&rsquo;t mean she&rsquo;s
      been thoughtless in the wrong way; it&rsquo;s just a&mdash;I can&rsquo;t very well
      describe it. But I hope you&rsquo;ll see her to-morrow night May I bring her to
      you when she comes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad your brother won&rsquo;t be here. I only mean, you know, I&rsquo;d rather
      she got accustomed just to you first of all. I dare say she&rsquo;ll be a bit
      timid, you won&rsquo;t mind that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela returned to the graver subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All the people at New Wanley are Socialists?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, all of them. They join the Union when they come to work, and we take
      a good deal of care in choosing our men.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you pay higher wages than other employers?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not much higher, but the rents of the cottages are very low, and all the
      food sold at the store is cost price. No, we don&rsquo;t pretend to make the men
      rich. We&rsquo;ve had a good lot coming with quite mistaken ideas, and of course
      they wouldn&rsquo;t suit us. And you mustn&rsquo;t call me the employer. All I have I
      look upon as the property of the Union; the men own it as much as I do.
      It&rsquo;s only that I regulate the work, just because somebody must. We&rsquo;re not
      making any profits to speak of yet, but that&rsquo;ll only come in time;
      whatever remains as clear profit,&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t take anything out of
      the works myself&mdash;goes to the Propaganda fund of the Union.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please forgive my ignorance. I&rsquo;ve heard that word &ldquo;Propaganda&rdquo; so often,
      but I don&rsquo;t know exactly what it means.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer became patronising, quite without intending it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Propaganda? Oh, that&rsquo;s the spreading our ideas, you know; printing paper,
      giving lectures, hiring places of meeting, and so on. That&rsquo;s what
      Propaganda means.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Adela musingly. Then she continued,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the workmen only have the advantage, at present, of the low rents and
      cheap food?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, a good deal more. To begin with, they&rsquo;re housed like human beings,
      and not like animals. Some day you shall see the kind of places the people
      live in, in London and other big towns. You won&rsquo;t believe your eyes. Then
      they have shorter hours of work; they&rsquo;re not treated like omnibus horses,
      calculating just how much can be got out of them without killing them
      before a reasonable time. Then they&rsquo;re sure of their work as long as they
      keep honest and don&rsquo;t break any of our rules; that&rsquo;s no slight thing, I
      can tell you. Why, on the ordinary system a man may find himself and his
      family without food any week end. Then there&rsquo;s a good school for the
      children; they pay threepence a week for each child. Then there&rsquo;s the
      reading-room and library, and the lectures, and the recreation-grounds.
      You just come over the place with me some day, and talk with the women,
      and see if they don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re well off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela looked him in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And it is you they have to thank for all this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want any credit for it,&rsquo; Mutimer replied, waving his hand.
      &lsquo;What would you think of me if I worked them like niggers and just enjoyed
      myself on the profits? That&rsquo;s what the capitalists do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you are doing more than most men would. There is only one thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She dropped her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that, Adela?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll speak of it some other time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know what you mean. You&rsquo;re sorry I&rsquo;ve got no religion. Ay, but I have!
      There&rsquo;s my religion, down there in New Wanley. I&rsquo;m saving men and women
      and children from hunger and cold and the lives of brute beasts. I teach
      them to live honestly and soberly. There&rsquo;s no public-house in New Wanley,
      and there won&rsquo;t be.&rsquo; (It just flashed across Adela&rsquo;s mind that Mutimer
      drank wine himself.) &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no bad language if I can help it. The
      children &lsquo;ll be brought up to respect the human nature that&rsquo;s in them, to
      honour their parents, and act justly and kindly to all they have dealings
      with. Isn&rsquo;t there a good deal of religion in that, Adela?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but not all. Not the most important part&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, as you say, we&rsquo;ll talk over that some other time. And now I&rsquo;m sorry
      I can&rsquo;t stay any longer. I&rsquo;ve twenty or thirty letters to get written
      before post-time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela rose as he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If there&rsquo;s ever anything I can do to help you,&rsquo; she said modestly, &lsquo;you
      will not fail to ask me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I won&rsquo;t What I want you to do now is to read what I&rsquo;ve marked in
      those books. You mustn&rsquo;t tire your eyes, you know; there&rsquo;s plenty of
      time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will read all you wish me to, and think over it as much as I can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you&rsquo;re a right-down good girl, and if I don&rsquo;t think myself a lucky
      man, I ought to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He left her trembling with a strange new emotion, the begin fling of a
      self-conscious zeal, an enthusiasm forced into being like a hothouse
      flower. It made her cheeks burn; she could not rest till her study had
      commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard had written to his sister, saying that he wanted her, that she
      must come at once. To Alice his thoughts had been long turning; now that
      the time for action had arrived, it was to her that he trusted for aid.
      Things he would find it impossible to do himself, Alice might do for him.
      He did not doubt his power of persuading her. With Alice principle would
      stand second to his advantage. He had hard things to ask of her, but the
      case was a desperate one, and she would endure the unpleasantness for his
      sake. He blessed her in anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice received the letter summoning her on Monday morning. Richard himself
      was expected in Highbury; expected, too, at a sad little house in Hoxton;
      for he had constantly promised to spend Christmas with his friends. The
      present letter did not say that he would not come, only that he wanted his
      sister immediately. She was to bring her best dress for wear when she
      arrived. He told her the train she was to take on Tuesday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summons filled Alice with delight. Wanley, whence had come the
      marvellous fortune, was in her imagination a land flowing with milk and
      honey. Moreover, this would be her first experience of travel; as yet she
      had never been farther out of London than to Epping Forest. The injunction
      to bring her best dress excited visions of polite company. All through
      Monday she practised ways of walking, of eating, of speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What can he want you for?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Mutimer gloomily. &lsquo;I sh&rsquo;d &lsquo;a
      thought he might &lsquo;a taken you with him after Christmas. It looks as if he
      wasn&rsquo;t coming.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman had been habitually gloomy of late. The reply she had
      received to her letter was not at all what she wanted; it increased her
      impatience; she had read it endless times, trying to get at the very
      meaning of it. Christmas must bring an end to this wretched state of
      things; at Christmas Dick would come to London and marry Emma; no doubt he
      had that time in view. Fears which she would not consciously admit were
      hovering about her night and day. She had begun to talk to herself aloud,
      a consequence of over-stress on a brain never used to anxious thought; she
      went about the upper rooms of the house muttering &lsquo;Dick&rsquo;s an honest man.&rsquo; 
      To keep moving seemed a necessity to her; the chair in the dim corner of
      the dining-room she now scarcely ever occupied, and the wonted employment
      of her fingers was in abeyance. She spent most of her day in the kitchen;
      already two servants had left because they could not endure her fidgety
      supervision. She was growing suspicious of every one; Alice had to listen
      ten times a day to complaints of dishonesty in the domestics or the
      tradespeople; the old woman kept as keen a watch over petty expenditure as
      if poverty had still to be guarded against. And she was constantly
      visiting the Vines; she would rise at small hours to get her house-work
      done, so as to be able to spend the afternoon in Wilton Square. That, in
      truth, was still her home; the new house could never be to her what the
      old was; she was a stranger amid the new furniture, and sighed with relief
      as soon as her eyes rested on the familiar chairs and tables which had
      been her household gods through a lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arry had given comparatively little trouble of late; beyond an occasional
      return home an hour or so after midnight, his proceedings seemed to be
      perfectly regular. He saw a good deal of Mr. Keene, who, as Alice gathered
      from various remarks in Richard&rsquo;s letters, exercised over him a sort of
      tutorage. It was singular how completely Richard seemed to have changed in
      his judgment of Mr. Keene. &lsquo;His connection with newspapers makes him very
      useful,&rsquo; said one letter. &lsquo;Be as friendly with him as you like; I trust to
      your good sense and understanding of your own interest to draw the line.&rsquo; 
      When at the house Mr. Keene was profoundly respectful; his position at
      such times was singular, for as often as not Alice had to entertain him
      alone. Profound, too, was the journalist&rsquo;s discretion in regard to all
      doings down at Wanley. Knowing he had several times visited the Manor,
      Alice often sought information from him about her brother&rsquo;s way of life.
      Mr. Keene always replied with generalities. He was a man of humour in his
      way, and Alice came to regard him with amusement. Then his extreme respect
      flattered her; insensibly she took him for her criterion of gentility in
      men. He supplied her with &lsquo;society&rsquo; journals, and now and then suggested
      the new novel that it behoved her to read. Richard had even withdrawn his
      opposition to the theatre-going; about once in three weeks Mr. Keene
      presented himself with tickets, and Alice, accompanied by her brother,
      accepted his invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called this Monday evening. Mrs. Mutimer, after spending a day of
      fretful misery, had gone to Wilton Square; &lsquo;Arry was away at his classes.
      Alice was packing certain articles she had purchased in the afternoon, and
      had just delighted her soul with the inspection of a travelling cloak,
      also bought to-day. When the visitor was announced, she threw the garment
      over her shoulders and appeared in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does this look nice, do you think?&rsquo; she asked, after shaking hands as
      joyously as her mood dictated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About as nice as a perfect thing always does when it&rsquo;s worn by a perfect
      woman,&rsquo; Mr. Keene replied, drawing back and inclining his body at what he
      deemed a graceful angle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, come, that&rsquo;s too much!&rsquo; laughed Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit, Miss Mutimer. I suppose you travel in it tomorrow morning?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did you know that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have heard from your brother to-day. I thought I might perhaps have the
      great pleasure of doing you some slight service either to-night or in the
      morning. You will allow me to attend you to the station?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I really don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any need to trouble you,&rsquo; Alice replied.
      These respectful phrases always stirred her pleasurably: in listening to
      them she bore herself with dignity, and endeavoured to make answer in
      becoming diction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Trouble? What other object have I in life but to serve you? I&rsquo;ll put it
      in another way: you won&rsquo;t refuse me the pleasure of being near you for a
      few minutes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re very kind. I know very well it&rsquo;s taking you out of your
      way, but it isn&rsquo;t likely I shall refuse to let you come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keene bowed low in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you brought me that paper?&rsquo; Alice asked, seating herself with
      careful arrangement of her dress. &lsquo;The Christmas number with the ghost
      story you spoke of, you know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of a varied life Mr. Keene had for some few months trodden
      the boards of provincial theatres; an occasional turn of his speech, and
      still more his favourite gestures, bore evidence to that period of his
      career. Instead of making direct reply to Alice&rsquo;s question, he stood for a
      moment as if dazed; then flinging back his body, smote his forehead with a
      ringing slap, and groaned &lsquo;O Heaven!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; cried the girl, not quite knowing whether to be
      amused or alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Keene was rushing from the room, and in an instant the house door
      sounded loudly behind him. Alice stood disconcerted; then, thinking she
      understood, laughed gaily and ran upstairs to complete her packing. In a
      quarter of an hour Mr. Keene&rsquo;s return brought her to the drawing-room
      again. The journalist was propping himself against the mantelpiece,
      gasping, his arms hanging limp, his hair disordered. As Alice approached
      he staggered forward, fell on one knee, and held to her the paper she had
      mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon&mdash;forgive!&rsquo; he panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, where ever have you been?&rsquo; exclaimed Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No matter! what are time and space? Forgive me, Miss Mutimer! I deserve
      to be turned out of the house, and never stand in the light of your
      countenance again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how foolish! As if it mattered all that. What a state you&rsquo;re in! I&rsquo;ll
      go and get you a glass of wine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran to the dining-room, and returned with a decanter and glass on a
      tray. Mr. Keene had sunk upon a settee, one arm hanging over the back, his
      eyes closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have pardoned me?&rsquo; he murmured, regarding her with weary rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see what there is to pardon. Do drink a glass of wine! Shall I
      pour it out for you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Drink and service for the gods!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean the people in the gallery?&rsquo; Alice asked roguishly, recalling
      a term in which Mr. Keene had instructed her at their latest visit to the
      theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are as witty as you are beautiful!&rsquo; he sighed, taking the glass and
      draining it. Alice turned away to the fire; decidedly Mr. Keene was in a
      gallant mood this evening; hitherto his compliments had been far more
      guarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      They began to converse in a more terrestrial manner. Alice wanted to know
      whom she was likely to meet at Wanley; and Mr. Keene, in a light way,
      sketched for her the Waltham family. She became thoughtful whilst he was
      describing Adela Waltham, and subsequently recurred several times to that
      young lady. The journalist allowed himself to enter into detail, and Alice
      almost ceased talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      It drew on to half-past nine. Mr. Keene never exceeded discretion in the
      hours of his visits. He looked at his watch and rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I may call at nine?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you really have time. But I can manage quite well by myself, you
      know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What you <i>can</i> do is not the question. If I had my will you should
      never know a moment&rsquo;s trouble as long as you lived.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I never have worse trouble than going to the railway station, I shall
      think myself lucky.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Mutimer&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t drop me altogether from your mind whilst you&rsquo;re away?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a change in his voice. He had abandoned the tone of excessive
      politeness, and spoke very much like a man who has feeling at the back of
      his words. Alice regarded him nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be away more than a day or two,&rsquo; she said, smoothing a
      fold in her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it was only an hour or two I couldn&rsquo;t bear to think you&rsquo;d altogether
      forgotten me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, of course I shan&rsquo;t!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But&mdash;Miss Mutimer, I&rsquo;m abusing confidence. Your brother trusts me;
      he&rsquo;s done me a good many kindnesses. But I can&rsquo;t help it, upon my soul. If
      you betray me, I&rsquo;m done for. You won&rsquo;t do that? I put myself in your
      power, and you&rsquo;re too good to hurt a fly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean, Mr. Keene?&rsquo; Alice asked, inwardly pleased, yet feeling
      uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t go away to-night without saying it, and ten to one it means I
      shall never see you again. You know what I mean. Well, harm me as you
      like; I&rsquo;d rather be harmed by you than done good to by any one else. I&rsquo;ve
      got so far, there&rsquo;s no going back. Do you think some day you could&mdash;do
      you think you <i>could</i>?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice dropped her eyes and shook her pretty head slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t give any promise of that kind,&rsquo; she replied under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You hate me? I&rsquo;m a disagreeable beast to you? I&rsquo;m a low&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear, don&rsquo;t say such things, Mr. Keene! The idea! I don&rsquo;t dislike you
      a bit; but of course that&rsquo;s a different thing&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand sadly, dashing the other over his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye, I don&rsquo;t think I can come again. I&rsquo;ve abused confidence. When
      your brother hears of it&mdash;. But no matter, I&rsquo;m only a&mdash;a sort of
      crossing-sweeper in your eyes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice&rsquo;s laugh rang merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What things you do call yourself! Now, don&rsquo;t go off like that, Mr. Keene.
      To begin with, my brother won&rsquo;t hear anything about it&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean that? You are so noble, so forgiving? Pooh, as if I didn&rsquo;t know
      you were! Upon my soul, I&rsquo;d run from here to South Kensington, like the
      ragamuffins after the cabs with luggage, only just to get a smile from
      you. Oh, Miss Mutimer&mdash;oh!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Keene, I can&rsquo;t say yes, and I don&rsquo;t like to be so unkind to you as to
      say no. You&rsquo;ll let that do for the present, won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless your bright eyes, of course I will! If I don&rsquo;t love you for your
      own sake, I&rsquo;m the wretchedest turnip-snatcher in London. Good-bye,
      Princess!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who taught you to call me that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Taught me? It was only a word that came naturally to my lips.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously, this was quite true. It impressed Alice Maud, and she thought
      of Mr. Keene for at least five minutes continuously after his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was extravagantly gay as they drove in a four-wheeled cab to the
      station next morning. Mr. Keene made no advances. He sat respectfully on
      the seat opposite her, with a travelling bag on his knees, and sighed
      occasionally. When she had secured her seat in the railway carriage he
      brought her sandwiches, buns, and sweetmeats enough for a voyage to New
      York. Alice waved her hand to him as the train moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached Agworth at one o&rsquo;clock; Richard had been pacing the platform
      impatiently for twenty minutes. Porters were eager to do his bidding, and
      his instructions to them were suavely imperative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They know me,&rsquo; he remarked to Alice, with his air of satisfaction. &lsquo;I
      suppose you&rsquo;re half frozen? I&rsquo;ve got a foot-warmer in the trap.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage promised to Adela was a luxury Richard had not ventured to
      allow himself. Alice mounted to a seat by his side, and he drove off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why on earth did you come second-class?&rsquo; he asked, after examining her
      attire with approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ought it to have been first? It really seemed such a lot of money, Dick,
      when I came to look at the fares.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it ought to have been first. In London things don&rsquo;t matter, but here
      I&rsquo;m known, you see. Did mother go to the station with you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Mr. Keene did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keene, eh?&rsquo; He bent his brows a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope he behaves himself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s very gentlemanly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, you ought to have come first-class. A princess riding second&rsquo;ll
      never do. You look well, old girl? Glad to come, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, guess! And is this your own horse and trap, Dick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who was that man? He touched his hat to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer glanced back carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. Most people touch their hats to me about here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an ideal winter day. A feathering of snow had fallen at dawn, and
      now the clear, cold sun made it sparkle far and wide. The horse&rsquo;s tread
      rang on the frozen highway. A breeze from the north-west chased the blood
      to healthsome leaping, and caught the breath like an unexpected kiss. The
      colour was high on Alice&rsquo;s fair cheeks; she laughed with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Dick, what a thing it is to be rich! And you do look such a
      gentleman; it&rsquo;s those gloves, I think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now we&rsquo;re going into the village,&rsquo; Mutimer said presently. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t look
      about you too much, and don&rsquo;t seem to be asking questions. Everybody &lsquo;ll
      be at the windows.&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Between the end of the village street and the gates of the Manor, Mutimer
      gave his sister hasty directions as to her behaviour before the servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Put on just a bit of the princess,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Not too much, you know, but
      just enough to show that it isn&rsquo;t the first time in your life that you&rsquo;ve
      been waited on. Don&rsquo;t always give a &lsquo;thank you;&rsquo; one every now and then&rsquo;ll
      do. I wouldn&rsquo;t smile too much or look pleased, whatever you see. Keep that
      all till we&rsquo;re alone together. We shall have lunch at once; I&rsquo;ll do most
      of the talking whilst the servants are about; you just answer quietly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      These instructions were interesting, but not altogether indispensable;
      Alice Maud had by this time a very pretty notion of how to conduct herself
      in the presence of menials. The trying moment was on entering the house;
      it was very hard indeed not to utter her astonishment and delight at the
      dimensions of the hall and the handsome staircase. This point safely
      passed, she resigned herself to splendour, and was conducted to her room
      in a sort of romantic vision. The Manor satisfied her idea of the
      ancestral mansion so frequently described or alluded to in the fiction of
      her earlier years. If her mind had just now reverted to Mr. Keene, which
      of course it did not, she would have smiled very royally indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she entered the drawing-room, clad in that best gown which her
      brother had needlessly requested her to bring, and saw that Richard was
      standing on the hearth-rug quite alone, she could no longer contain
      herself, but bounded towards him like a young fawn, and threw her arms on
      his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Dick,&rsquo; she whispered, &lsquo;what a thing it is to be rich! How ever did we
      live so long in the old way! If I had to go back to it now I should die of
      misery.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look at you,&rsquo; he returned, holding her at arm&rsquo;s length.
      &lsquo;Yes, I think that&rsquo;ll about do. Now mind you don&rsquo;t let them see that
      you&rsquo;re excited about it. Sit down here and pretend to be a bit tired. They
      may come and say lunch is ready any moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dick, I never felt so good in my life! I should like to go about the
      streets and give sovereigns to everybody I met.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard laughed loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, there&rsquo;s better ways than that. I&rsquo;ve been giving a good many
      sovereigns for a long time now. I&rsquo;m only sorry you weren&rsquo;t here when we
      opened the Hall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you haven&rsquo;t told me why you sent for me now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, we&rsquo;ve got to have a long talk presently. It isn&rsquo;t all as jolly
      as you think, but I can&rsquo;t help that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what can be wrong, Dick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind; it&rsquo;ll all come out in time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice came back upon certain reflections which had occupied her earlier in
      the morning; they kept her busy through luncheon. Whilst she ate, Richard
      observed her closely; on the whole he could not perceive a great
      difference between her manners and Adela&rsquo;s. Difference there was, but in
      details to which Mutimer was not very sensitive. He kept up talk about the
      works for the most part, and described certain difficulties concerning
      rights of way which had of late arisen in the vicinity of the industrial
      settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you shall come and sit with me in the library,&rsquo; he said as they
      rose from table. And he gave orders that coffee should be served to them
      in that room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The library did not as yet quite justify its name. There was only one
      bookcase, and not more than fifty volumes stood on its shelves. But a
      large writing-table was well covered with papers. There were no pictures
      on the walls, a lack which was noticeable throughout the house. The effect
      was a certain severity; there was no air of home in the spacious chambers;
      the walls seemed to frown upon their master, the hearths were cold to him
      as to an intruding alien. Perhaps Alice felt something of this; on
      entering the library she shivered a little, and went to warm her hands at
      the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit in this deep chair,&rsquo; said her brother. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have a cigarette. How&rsquo;s
      mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, she hasn&rsquo;t been quite herself,&rsquo; Alice replied, gazing into the
      fire. &lsquo;She can&rsquo;t get to feel at home, that&rsquo;s the truth of it. She goes.
      very often to the old house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Goes very often to the old house, does she?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He repeated the words mechanically, watching smoke that issued from his
      lips. &lsquo;Suppose she&rsquo;ll get all right in time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When the coffee arrived a decanter of cognac accompanied it. Richard had
      got into the habit of using the latter rather freely of late. He needed a
      stimulant in view of the conversation that was before him. The
      conversation was difficult to begin. For a quarter of an hour he strayed
      over subjects, each of which, he thought, might bring him to the point. A
      question from Alice eventually gave him the requisite impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the bad news you&rsquo;ve got to tell me, Dick?&rsquo; she asked shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bad news? Why, yes, I suppose it is bad, and it&rsquo;s no use pretending
      anything else. I&rsquo;ve brought you down here just to tell it you. Somebody
      must know first, and it had better be somebody who&rsquo;ll listen patiently,
      and perhaps help me to get over it. I don&rsquo;t know quite how you&rsquo;ll take it,
      Alice. For anything I can tell you may get up and be off, and have nothing
      more to do with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what ever can it be, Dick? Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense. You&rsquo;re not afraid of
      <i>me</i>, I should think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I am a bit afraid of you, old girl. It isn&rsquo;t a nice thing to tell
      you, and there&rsquo;s the long and short of it. I&rsquo;m hanged if I know how to
      begin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed in an irresolute way. Trying to light a new cigarette from the
      remnants of the one he had smoked, his hands shook. Then he had recourse
      again to cognac.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice was drumming with her foot on the floor. She sat forward, her arms
      crossed upon her lap. Her eyes were still on the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it anything about Emma, Dick?&rsquo; she asked, after a disconcerting
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better tell me at once? It isn&rsquo;t at all nice to feel like
      this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you. I can&rsquo;t marry Emma; I&rsquo;m going to marry someone
      else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice was prepared, but the plain words caused her a moment&rsquo;s
      consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, what ever will they all say, Dick?&rsquo; she exclaimed in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s bad enough, to be sure, but I think more about Emma herself. I
      feel ashamed of myself, and that&rsquo;s the plain truth. Of course I shall
      always give her and her sisters all the money they want to live upon, but
      that isn&rsquo;t altogether a way out. If only I could have hinted something to
      her before now. I&rsquo;ve let it go on so long. I&rsquo;m going to be married in a
      fortnight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not look Alice in the face, nor she him. His shame made him
      angry; he flung the half-smoked cigarette violently into the fire-place,
      and began to walk about the room. Alice was speaking, but he did not heed
      her, and continued with impatient loudness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who the devil could imagine what was going to happen? Look here, Alice;
      if it hadn&rsquo;t been for mother, I shouldn&rsquo;t have engaged myself to Emma. I
      shouldn&rsquo;t have cared much in the old kind of life; she&rsquo;d have suited me
      very well. You can say all the good about her you like, I know it&rsquo;ll be
      true. It&rsquo;s a cursed shame to treat her in this way, I don&rsquo;t need telling
      that. But it wouldn&rsquo;t do as things are; why, you can see for yourself&mdash;would
      it now? And that&rsquo;s only half the question: I&rsquo;m going to marry somebody I
      do really care for. What&rsquo;s the good of keeping my word to Emma, only to be
      miserable myself and make her the same? It&rsquo;s the hardest thing ever
      happened to a man. Of course I shall be blackguarded right and left. Do I
      deserve it now? Can I help it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not quite consistent with the tone in which he had begun, but it
      had the force of a genuine utterance. To this Richard had worked himself
      in fretting over his position; he was the real sufferer, though decency
      compelled him to pretend it was not so. He had come to think of Emma
      almost angrily; she was a clog on him, and all the more irritating because
      he knew that his brute strength, if only he might exert it, could sweep
      her into nothingness at a blow. The quietness with which Alice accepted
      his revelation encouraged him in self-defence. He talked on for several
      minutes, walking about and swaying his arms, as if in this way he could
      literally shake himself free of moral obligations. Then, finding his
      throat dry, he had recourse to cognac, and Alice could at length speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t told me, Dick, who it is you&rsquo;re going to marry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A lady called Miss Waltham&mdash;Adela Waltham. She lives here in
      Wanley.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does she know about Emma?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was simply put, but it seemed to affect Richard very
      disagreeably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, of course she doesn&rsquo;t. What would be the use?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw himself into a chair, crossed his feet, and kept silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry for Emma,&rsquo; murmured his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How shall you tell her, Dick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell her!&rsquo; he replied, throwing out an arm. &lsquo;How is it likely I
      can tell her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Jane&rsquo;s so dreadfully bad,&rsquo; continued Alice in the undertone. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s
      always saying she cares for nothing but to see Emma married. What <i>shall</i>
      we do? And everything seemed so first-rate. Suppose she summonses you,
      Dick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The noble and dignified legal process whereby maidens right themselves
      naturally came into Alice&rsquo;s thoughts. Her brother scouted the suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Emma&rsquo;s not that kind of girl. Besides, I&rsquo;ve told you I shall always send
      her money. She&rsquo;ll find another husband before long. Lots of men &lsquo;ud be
      only too glad to marry her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice was not satisfied with her brother. The practical aspects of the
      rupture she could consider leniently, but the tone he assumed was jarring
      to her instincts. Though nothing like a warm friendship existed between
      her and Emma, she sympathised, in a way impossible to Richard, with the
      sorrows of the abandoned girl. She was conscious of what her judgment
      would be if another man had acted thus; and though this was not so much a
      matter of consciousness, she felt that Richard might have spoken in a way
      more calculated to aid her in taking his side. She wished, in fact, to see
      only his advantage, and was very much tempted to see everything but that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you can&rsquo;t keep her in the dark any longer,&rsquo; she urged. &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s
      cruel!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell her,&rsquo; he repeated monotonously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice drew in her feet. It symbolised retiring within her defences. She
      saw what he was aiming at, and felt not at all disposed to pleasure him.
      There was a long silence; Alice was determined not to be the first to
      break it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You refuse to help me?&rsquo; Richard asked at length, between his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it would be every bit as bad for me as for you,&rsquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That you can&rsquo;t think,&rsquo; he argued. &lsquo;She can&rsquo;t blame you; you&rsquo;ve only to
      say I&rsquo;ve behaved like a blackguard, and you&rsquo;re out of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And when do you mean to tell mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll have to hear of it from other people. I can&rsquo;t tell her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard had a suspicion that he was irretrievably ruining himself in his
      sister&rsquo;s opinion, and it did not improve his temper. It was a foretaste of
      the wider obloquy to come upon him, possibly as hard to bear as any
      condemnation to which he had exposed himself. He shook himself out of the
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got to tell you. Perhaps you&rsquo;d better think over
      it. I don&rsquo;t want to keep you away from home longer than you care to stay.
      There&rsquo;s a train at a few minutes after nine in the morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shuffled for a few moments about the writing-table, then went from the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice was unhappy. The reaction from her previous high spirits, as soon as
      it had fully come about, brought her even to tears. She cried silently,
      and, to do the girl justice, at least half her sorrow was on Emma&rsquo;s
      account. Presently she rose and began to walk about the room; she went to
      the window, and looked out on to the white garden. The sky beyond the thin
      boughs was dusking; the wind, which sang so merrily a few hours ago, had
      fallen to sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too wretched to remain alone; she resolved to go into the
      drawing-room; perhaps her brother was there. As she approached the door
      somebody knocked on the outside, then there entered a dark man of spruce
      appearance, who drew back a step as soon as he saw her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray excuse me,&rsquo; he said, with an air of politeness. &lsquo;I supposed I should
      find Mr. Mutimer here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think he&rsquo;s in the house,&rsquo; Alice replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard appeared as they were speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it, Rodman?&rsquo; he asked abruptly, passing into the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go to the drawing-room,&rsquo; Alice said, and left the men together.
    </p>
    <p>
      In half an hour Richard again joined her. He seemed in a better frame of
      mind, for he came in humming. Alice, having glanced at him, averted her
      face again and kept silence. She felt a hand smoothing her hair. Her
      brother, leaning over the back of her seat, whispered to her,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll help me, Princess?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t be hard, Alice? It&rsquo;s a wretched business, and I don&rsquo;t know what
      I shall do if you throw me over. I can&rsquo;t do without you, old girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell mother, Dick. You know very well what it&rsquo;ll be. I daren&rsquo;t do
      that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But even that task Alice at last took upon herself, after another
      half-hour&rsquo;s discussion. Alas! she would never again feel towards her
      brother as before this necessity fell upon her. Her life had undergone
      that impoverishment which is so dangerous to elementary natures, the loss
      of an ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll let me stay over to-morrow?&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing very
      pleasant to go back to, and I don&rsquo;t see that a day &lsquo;ll matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can stay if you wish. I&rsquo;m going to take you to have tea with Adela
      now. If you stay we&rsquo;ll have her to dinner to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder whether we shall get along?&rsquo; Alice mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not. You&rsquo;ll get lots of things from her, little notions
      of all kinds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is always a more or less dangerous form of recommendation, even in
      talking to one&rsquo;s sister. To suggest that Adela would benefit by the
      acquaintance would have been a far more politic procedure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with me?&rsquo; Alice inquired, still depressed by the scene she
      had gone through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong. It&rsquo;s only that you&rsquo;ll see differences at
      first; from the people you&rsquo;ve been used to, I mean. But I think you&rsquo;ll
      have to go and get your things on; it&rsquo;s nearly five.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In Alice&rsquo;s rising from her chair there was nothing of the elasticity that
      had marked her before luncheon. Before moving away she spoke a thought
      that was troubling her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suppose mother tries to stop it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard looked to the ground moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I meant to tell you,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better say that I&rsquo;m already
      married.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re giving me a nice job,&rsquo; was the girl&rsquo;s murmured rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s as good as true. And it doesn&rsquo;t make the job any worse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As is wont to be the case when two persons come to mutual understanding on
      a piece of baseness, the tone of brother and sister had suffered in the
      course of their dialogue. At first meeting they had both kept a certain
      watch upon their lips, feeling that their position demanded it; a moral
      limpness was evident in them by this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      They set forth to walk to the Walthams&rsquo;. Exercise in the keen air,
      together with the sense of novelty in her surroundings, restored Alice&rsquo;s
      good humour before the house was reached. She gazed with astonishment at
      the infernal glare over New Wanley. Her brother explained the sight to her
      with gusto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It used to be all fields and gardens over there,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;See what
      money and energy can do! You shall go over the works in the morning.
      Perhaps Adela will go with us, then we can take her back to the Manor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do they call the house that, Dick?&rsquo; Alice inquired. &lsquo;Is it because
      people who live there are supposed to have good manners?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May be, for anything I know,&rsquo; was the capitalist&rsquo;s reply. &lsquo;Only it&rsquo;s
      spelt different, you know. I say, Alice, you must be careful about your
      spelling; there were mistakes in your last letter. Won&rsquo;t do, you know, to
      make mistakes if you write to Adela.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice gave a little shrug of impatience. Immediately after, they stopped
      at the threshold sacred to all genteel accomplishments&mdash;so Alice
      would have phrased it if she could have fully expressed her feeling&mdash;and
      they speedily entered the sitting-room, where the table was already laid
      for tea. Mrs. Waltham and her daughter rose to welcome them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We knew of your arrival,&rsquo; said the former, bestowing on Alice a maternal
      salute. &lsquo;Not many things happen in Wanley that all the village doesn&rsquo;t
      hear of, do they, Mr. Mutimer? Of course we expected you to tea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela and her future sister-in-law kissed each other. Adela was silent,
      but she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll take your things off, my dear?&rsquo; Mrs. Waltham continued. &lsquo;Will you
      go upstairs with Miss Mutimer, Adela?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But for Mrs. Waltham&rsquo;s persistent geniality the hour which followed would
      have shown many lapses of conversation. Alice appreciated at once those
      &lsquo;differences&rsquo; at which her brother had hinted, and her present frame of
      mind was not quite consistent with patient humility. Naturally, she
      suffered much from self-consciousness; Mrs. Waltham annoyed her by too
      frequent observation, Adela by seeming indifference. The delicacy of the
      latter was made perhaps a little excessive by strain of feelings. Alice at
      once came to the conclusion that Dick&rsquo;s future wife was cold and
      supercilious. She was not predisposed to like Adela. The circumstances
      were in a number of ways unfavourable. Even had there not existed the very
      natural resentment at the painful task which this young lady had
      indirectly imposed upon her, it was not in Alice&rsquo;s blood and breeding to
      take kindly at once to a girl of a class above her own. Alice had warm
      affections; as a lady&rsquo;s maid she might very conceivably have attached
      herself with much devotion to an indulgent mistress, but in the present
      case too much was asked of her, Richard was proud of his sister; he saw
      her at length seated where he had so often imagined her, and in his eyes
      she bore herself well. He glanced often at Adela, hoping for a return
      glance of congratulation; when it failed to come, he consoled himself with
      the reflection that such silent interchange of sentiments at table would
      be ill manners. In his very heart he believed that of the two maidens his
      sister was the better featured. Adela and Alice sat over against each
      other; their contrasted appearances were a chapter of social history. Mark
      the difference between Adela&rsquo;s gently closed lips, every muscle under
      control; and Alice&rsquo;s, which could never quite close without forming a
      saucy pout or a self-conscious primness. Contrast the foreheads; on the
      one hand that tenderly shadowed curve of brow, on the other the surface
      which always seemed to catch too much of the light, which moved
      irregularly with the arches above the eyes. The grave modesty of the one
      face, the now petulant, now abashed, now vacant expression of the other.
      Richard in his heart preferred the type he had 80 long been familiar with;
      a state of feeling of course in no way inconsistent with the emotions
      excited in him by continual observation of Adela.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two returned to the Manor at half-past seven, Alice rising with
      evident relief when he gave the signal. It was agreed that the latter part
      of the next morning should be spent in going over the works. Adela was
      very willing to be of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They haven&rsquo;t much money, have they?&rsquo; was Alice&rsquo;s first question as soon
      as she got away from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, they are not rich,&rsquo; replied the brother. &lsquo;You got on very nicely, old
      girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I? You talk as if I didn&rsquo;t know how to behave myself,
      Dick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. I say that you did behave yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, and you were surprised at it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wasn&rsquo;t at all. What do you think of her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She doesn&rsquo;t say much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, she&rsquo;s always very quiet. It&rsquo;s her way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The monosyllable meant more than Richard gathered from it. They walked on
      in silence, and were met presently by a gentleman who was coming along the
      village street at a sharp pace. A lamp discovered Mr. Willis Rodman.
      Richard stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seen to that little business?&rsquo; he asked, in a cheerful voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; was Rodman&rsquo;s reply. &lsquo;We shall hear from Agworth in the morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right.&mdash;Alice, this is Mr. Rodman.&mdash;My sister, Rodman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard&rsquo;s right-hand man performed civilities with decidedly more finish
      than Richard himself had at command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very happy to meet Miss Mutimer. I hope we shall have the pleasure
      of showing her New Wanley to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She and Miss Waltham will walk down in the morning. Good night, Rodman.
      Cold, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you introduce him this afternoon?&rsquo; Alice asked as she walked
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of it&mdash;I was bothered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He seems very gentlemanly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Rodman&rsquo;s seen a deal of life. He&rsquo;s a useful fellow&mdash;gets through
      work in a wonderful way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But <i>is</i> he a gentleman? I mean, was he once?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose you mean, had he ever money? No, he&rsquo;s made himself what he is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea having supplied the place of the more substantial evening meal,
      Richard and his sister had supper about ten o&rsquo;clock. Alice drank
      champagne; a few bottles remained from those dedicated to the recent
      festival, and Mutimer felt the necessity of explaining the presence in his
      house of a luxury which to his class is more than anything associated with
      the bloated aristocracy. Alice drank it for the first time in her life,
      and her spirits grew as light as the foam upon her glass. Brother and
      sister were quietly confidential as midnight drew near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall you bring her to London?&rsquo; Alice inquired, without previous mention
      of Adela.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For a week, I think. We shall go to an hotel, of course. She&rsquo;s never seen
      London since she was a child.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She won&rsquo;t come to Highbury?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. I shall avoid that somehow. You&rsquo;ll have to come and see us at the
      hotel. We&rsquo;ll go to the theatre together one night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What about &lsquo;Arry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I shall think about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Digesting much at his ease, Richard naturally became dreamful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I may have to take a house for a time now and then,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In London?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mustn&rsquo;t forget you, you see, Princess. Of course you&rsquo;ll come here
      sometimes, but that&rsquo;s not much good. In London I dare say I can get you to
      know some of the right kind of people. I want Adela to be thick with the
      Westlakes; then your chance&rsquo;ll come. See, old woman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice, too, dreamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder you don&rsquo;t want me to marry a Socialist working man,&rsquo; she said
      presently, as if twitting him playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t understand. One of the things we aim at is to remove the
      distinction between classes. I want you to marry one of those they call
      gentlemen. And you shall too, Alice!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, but I&rsquo;m not a working girl now, Dick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, and said it was time to go to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same evening conversation continued to a late hour between Hubert
      Eldon and his mother. Hubert was returning to London the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday there had come to him two letters from Wanley, both addressed in
      female hand. He knew Adela&rsquo;s writing from her signature in the &lsquo;Christian
      Year,&rsquo; and hastily opened the letter which came from her. The sight of the
      returned sonnets checked the eager flow of his blood; he was prepared for
      what he afterwards read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then let her meet her fate,&rsquo;&mdash;so ran his thoughts when he had
      perused the cold note, unassociable with the Adela he imagined in its bald
      formality. &lsquo;Only life can teach her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The other letter he suspected to be from Letty Tew, as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;DEAR MR. ELDON,&mdash;I cannot help writing a line to you, lest you
      should think that I did not keep my promise in the way you understood it.
      I did indeed. You will hear from her; she preferred to write herself, and
      perhaps it was better; I should only have had painful things to say. I
      wish to ask you to have no unkind or unjust thoughts; I scarcely think you
      could have. Please do not trouble to answer this, but believe me, yours
      sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;L. TEW.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good little girl!&rsquo; he said to himself, smiling sadly. &lsquo;I feel sure she
      did her best.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But his pride was asserting itself, always restive under provocation. To
      rival with a man like Mutimer! Better that the severance with old days
      should be complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked it all over very frankly with his mother, who felt that her
      son&rsquo;s destiny was not easily foreseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what do you propose to do, Hubert?&rsquo; she asked, when they spoke of the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To study, principally art. In a fortnight I go to Rome.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eldon had gone thither thirty years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think of me in my chair sometimes,&rsquo; she said, touching his hands with her
      wan fingers.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Alice reached home again on Christmas Eve. It was snowing; she came in
      chilled and looking miserable. Mrs. Mutimer met her in the hall, passed
      her, and looked out at the open door, then turned with a few white flecks
      on her gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Dick?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He couldn&rsquo;t come,&rsquo; replied the girl briefly, and ran up to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arry was spending the evening with friends. Since tea-time the old woman
      had never ceased moving from room to room, up and down stairs. She had got
      out an old pair of Richard&rsquo;s slippers, and had put them before the
      dining-room fire to warm. She had made a bed for Richard, and had a fire
      burning in the chamber. She had made arrangements for her eldest son&rsquo;s
      supper. No word had come from Wanley, but she held to the conviction that
      this night would see Richard in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice came down and declared that she was very hungry. Her mother went to
      the kitchen to order a meal, which in the end she prepared with her own
      hands. She seemed to have a difficulty in addressing any one. Whilst Alice
      ate in silence, Mrs. Mutimer kept going in and out of the room; when the
      girl rose from the table, she stood before her and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t he come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice went to the fireplace, knelt down, and spread her hands to the
      blaze. Her mother approached her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you give me no answer, Alice?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He couldn&rsquo;t come, mother. Something important is keeping him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something important? And why did he want you there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice rose to her feet, made one false beginning, then spoke to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dick&rsquo;s married, mother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman&rsquo;s eyes seemed to grow small in her wrinkled face, as if
      directing themselves with effort upon something minute. They looked
      straight into the eyes of her daughter, but had a more distant focus. The
      fixed gaze continued for nearly a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you talking about, girl?&rsquo; she said at length, in a strange,
      rattling voice. &lsquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve seen Emma this very morning. Do you think she
      wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;a told me if she&rsquo;d been a wife?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice was frightened by the look and the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother, it isn&rsquo;t Emma at all. It&rsquo;s someone at Wanley. We can&rsquo;t help it,
      mother. It&rsquo;s no use taking on. Now sit down and make yourself quiet. It
      isn&rsquo;t our fault.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mutimer smiled in a grim way, then laughed&mdash;a most unmusical
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now what&rsquo;s the good o&rsquo; joking in that kind o&rsquo; way? That&rsquo;s like your
      father, that is; he&rsquo;d often come &lsquo;ome an&rsquo; tell me sich things as never
      was, an&rsquo; expect me to believe &lsquo;em. An&rsquo; I used to purtend I did, jist to
      please him. But I&rsquo;m too old for that kind o&rsquo; jokin&rsquo;.&mdash;Alice, where&rsquo;s
      Dick? How long&rsquo;ll it be before he&rsquo;s here? Where did he leave you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now do just sit down, mother; here, in this chair. Just sit quiet for a
      little, do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mutimer pushed aside the girl&rsquo;s hand; her face had become grave
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me be, child. And I tell you I have seen Emma to-day. Do you think
      she wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;a told me if things o&rsquo; that kind was goin&rsquo; on?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Emma knows nothing about it, mother. He hasn&rsquo;t told any one. He got me to
      come because he couldn&rsquo;t tell it himself. It was as much a surprise to me
      as to you, and I think it&rsquo;s very cruel of him. But it&rsquo;s over, and we can&rsquo;t
      help it. I shall have to tell Emma, I suppose, and a nice thing too!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman had begun to quiver; her hands shook by her sides, her very
      features trembled with gathering indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dick has gone an&rsquo; done this?&rsquo; she stammered. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s gone an&rsquo; broke his
      given word? He&rsquo;s deceived that girl as trusted to him an&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t help
      herself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, mother, don&rsquo;t take on so! You&rsquo;re going to make yourself ill. It
      can&rsquo;t be helped. He says he shall send Emma money just the same.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Money! There you&rsquo;ve hit the word; it&rsquo;s money as &lsquo;as ruined him, and as
      &lsquo;ll be the ruin of us all. Send her money! What does the man think she&rsquo;s
      made of? Is all his feelings got as hard as money? and does he think the
      same of every one else? If I know Emma, she&rsquo;ll throw his money in his
      face. I knew what &lsquo;ud come of it, don&rsquo;t tell me I didn&rsquo;t. That very night
      as he come &lsquo;ome an&rsquo; told me what had &lsquo;appened, there was a cold shiver run
      over me. I told him as it was the worst news ever come into our &lsquo;ouse, and
      now see if I wasn&rsquo;t right! He was angry with me &lsquo;cause I said it, an&rsquo; 
      who&rsquo;s a right to be angry now? It&rsquo;s my belief as money&rsquo;s the curse o&rsquo; this
      world; I never knew a trouble yet as didn&rsquo;t somehow come of it, either
      &lsquo;cause there was too little or else too much. And Dick&rsquo;s gone an&rsquo; done
      this? And him with all his preachin&rsquo; about rights and wrongs an&rsquo; what not!
      Him as was always a-cryin&rsquo; down the rich folks &lsquo;cause they hadn&rsquo;t no
      feelin&rsquo; for the poor! What feeling&rsquo;s <i>he</i> had, I&rsquo;d like to know? It&rsquo;s
      him as is rich now, an&rsquo; where&rsquo;s the difference &lsquo;tween him and them as he
      called names? No feelin&rsquo; for the poor! An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s Emma Vine? Poor enough
      by now. There&rsquo;s Jane as can&rsquo;t have not a week more to live, an&rsquo; she
      a-nursin&rsquo; her night an&rsquo; day. He&rsquo;ll give her money!&mdash;has he got the
      face to say it? Nay, don&rsquo;t talk to me, girl; I&rsquo;ll say what I think if it&rsquo;s
      the last I speak in this world. Don&rsquo;t let him come to me! Never a word
      again shall he have from me as long as I live. He&rsquo;s disgraced himself, an&rsquo; 
      me his mother, an&rsquo; his father in the grave. A poor girl as couldn&rsquo;t help
      herself, as trusted him an&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t hear not a word against him, for all
      he kep&rsquo; away from her in her trouble. I&rsquo;d a fear o&rsquo; this, but I wouldn&rsquo;t
      believe it of Dick; I wouldn&rsquo;t believe it of a son o&rsquo; mine. An&rsquo; &lsquo;Arry &lsquo;ll
      go the same way. It&rsquo;s all the money, an a curse go with all the money as
      ever was made! An&rsquo; you too, Alice, wi&rsquo; your fine dresses, an&rsquo; your
      piannerin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; your faldedals. But I warn you, my girl. There &lsquo;ll no good
      come of it. I warn you, Alice! You&rsquo;re ashamed o&rsquo; your own mother&mdash;oh,
      I&rsquo;ve seen it! But it&rsquo;s a mercy if you&rsquo;re not a disgrace to her. I&rsquo;m
      thankful as I was always poor; I might &lsquo;a been tempted i&rsquo; the same way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The dogma of a rude nature full of secret forces found utterance at length
      under the scourge of a resentment of very mingled quality. Let half be put
      to the various forms of disinterested feeling, at least half was due to
      personal exasperation. The whole change that her life had perforce
      undergone was an outrage upon the stubbornness of uninstructed habit; the
      old woman could see nothing but evil omens in a revolution which cost her
      bodily discomfort and the misery of a mind perplexed amid alien
      conditions. She was prepared for evil; for months she had brooded over
      every sign which seemed to foretell its approach; the egoism of the
      unconscious had made it plain to her that the world must suffer in a state
      of things which so grievously affected herself. Maternal solicitude kept
      her restlessly swaying between apprehension for her children and injury in
      the thought of their estrangement from her. And now at length a bitter
      shame added itself to her torments. She was shamed in her pride as a
      mother, shamed before the girl for whom she nourished a deep affection.
      Emma&rsquo;s injuries she felt charged upon herself; she would never dare to
      stand before her again. Her moral code, as much a part of her as the sap
      of the plant and as little the result of conscious absorption, declared
      itself on the side of all these rushing impulses; she was borne blindly on
      an exhaustless flux of words. After vain attempts to make herself heard,
      Alice turned away and sat sullenly waiting for the outburst to spend
      itself. Herself comparatively unaffected by the feelings strongest in her
      mother, this ear-afflicting clamour altogether checked her sympathy, and
      in a great measure overcame those personal reasons which had made her
      annoyed with Richard. She found herself taking his side, even knew
      something of his impatience with Emma and her sorrows. When it came to
      rebukes and charges against herself her impatience grew active. She stood
      up again and endeavoured to make herself heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the good of going on like this, mother? Just because you&rsquo;re angry,
      that&rsquo;s no reason you should call us all the names you can turn your tongue
      to. It&rsquo;s over and done with, and there&rsquo;s an end of it. I don&rsquo;t know what
      you mean about disgracing you; I think you might wait till the time comes.
      I don&rsquo;t see what I&rsquo;ve done as you can complain of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, of course you don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; pursued her mother bitterly. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the money as
      prevents you from seeing it. Them as was good enough for you before you
      haven&rsquo;t a word to say to now; a man as works honestly for his living you
      make no account of. Well, well, you must go your own way&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it you want, mother? You don&rsquo;t expect me to look no higher than
      when I hadn&rsquo;t a penny but what I worked for? I&rsquo;ve no patience with you.
      You ought to be glad&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t no patience, of course you haven&rsquo;t. And I&rsquo;m to be glad when a
      son of mine does things as he deserves to be sent to prison for! I don&rsquo;t
      understand that kind o&rsquo; gladness. But mind what I say; do what you like
      with your money, I&rsquo;ll have no more part in it. If I had as much as ten
      shillings a week of my own, I&rsquo;d go and live by myself, and leave you to
      take your own way. But I tell you what I <i>can</i> do, and what I will.
      I&rsquo;ll have no more servants a-waitin&rsquo; on <i>me</i>; I wasn&rsquo;t never used to
      it, and I&rsquo;m too old to begin. I go to my own bedroom upstairs, and there I
      live, and there &lsquo;ll be nobody go into that room but myself. I&rsquo;ll get my
      bits o&rsquo; meals from the kitchen. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t much as I want, thank goodness,
      an&rsquo; it won&rsquo;t be missed. I&rsquo;ll have no more doin&rsquo;s with servants, understand
      that; an&rsquo; if I can&rsquo;t be left alone i&rsquo; my own room, I&rsquo;ll go an&rsquo; find a room
      where I can, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll find some way of earnin&rsquo; what little I want. It&rsquo;s
      your own house, and you&rsquo;ll do what you like in it. There&rsquo;s the keys, I&rsquo;ve
      done with &lsquo;em; an&rsquo; here&rsquo;s the money too, I&rsquo;m glad to be rid of it. An&rsquo; 
      you&rsquo;ll just tell Dick. I ain&rsquo;t one as says what I don&rsquo;t mean, nor never
      was, as that you know. You take your way, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll take mine. An&rsquo; now may
      be I&rsquo;ll get a night&rsquo;s sleep, the first I&rsquo;ve had under this roof.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she took from her pockets the house keys, and from her purse
      the money she used for current expenses, and threw all together on to the
      table. Alice had turned to the fireplace, and she stood so for a long time
      after her mother had left the room. Then she took the keys and the money,
      consulted her watch, and in a few minutes was walking from the house to a
      neighbouring cab-stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drove to Wilton Square. Inspecting the front of the house before
      knocking at the door, she saw a light in the kitchen and a dimmer gleam at
      an upper window. It was Mrs. Clay who opened to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Emma in?&rsquo; Alice inquired as she shook hands rather coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s sitting with Jane. I&rsquo;ll tell her. There&rsquo;s no fire except in the
      kitchen,&rsquo; Kate added, in a tone which implied that doubtless her visitor
      was above taking a seat downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go down,&rsquo; Alice replied, with just a touch of condescension. &lsquo;I want
      to speak a word or two with Emma, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate left her to descend the stairs, and went to inform her sister. Emma
      was not long in appearing; the hue of her face was troubled, for she had
      deceived herself with the belief that it was Richard who knocked at the
      door. What more natural than for him to have come on Christmas Eve? She
      approached Alice with a wistful look, not venturing to utter any question,
      only hoping that some good news might have been brought her. Long watching
      in the sick room had given her own complexion the tint of ill-health; her
      eyelids were swollen and heavy; the brown hair upon her temples seemed to
      droop in languor. You would have noticed that her tread was very soft, as
      if she still were moving in the room above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How&rsquo;s Jane?&rsquo; Alice began by asking. She could not quite look the other in
      the face, and did not know how to begin her disclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No better,&rsquo; Emma gave answer, shaking her head. Her voice, too, was
      suppressed; it was weeks since she had spoken otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am so sorry, Emma. Are you in a hurry to go up again?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. Kate will sit there a little.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You look very poorly yourself. It must be very trying for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t feel it,&rsquo; Emma said, with a pale smile. &lsquo;She gives no trouble.
      It&rsquo;s only her weakness now; the pain has almost gone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But then she must be getting better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma shook her head, looking aside. As Alice kept silence, she continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was glad to hear you&rsquo;d gone to see Richard. He wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;I was
      afraid he mightn&rsquo;t have time to get here for Christmas.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a question in the words, a timorously expectant question. Emma
      had learnt the sad lesson of hope deferred, always to meet discouragement
      halfway. It is thus one seeks to propitiate the evil powers, to turn the
      edge of their blows by meekness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, he couldn&rsquo;t come,&rsquo; said Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a muff on her left hand, and was turning it round and round with
      the other. Emma had not asked her to sit down, merely because of the
      inward agitation which absorbed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s quite well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, quite well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Alice paused. Emma&rsquo;s heart was beating painfully. She knew now that
      Richard&rsquo;s sister had not come on an ordinary visit; she felt that the call
      to Wanley had had some special significance. Alice did not ordinarily
      behave in this hesitating way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did&mdash;did he send me a message?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But even now Alice could not speak. She found a way of leading up to the
      catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, mother has been going on so, Emma! What do you think? She won&rsquo;t have
      anything to do with the house any longer. She&rsquo;s given me the keys and all
      the money she had, and she&rsquo;s going to live just in her bedroom. She says
      she&rsquo;ll get her food from the kitchen herself, and she won&rsquo;t have a thing
      done for her by any one. I&rsquo;m sure she means it; I never saw her in such a
      state. She says if she&rsquo;d ever so little money of her own, she&rsquo;d leave the
      house altogether. She&rsquo;s been telling me I&rsquo;ve no feeling, and that I&rsquo;m
      going to the bad, that I shall live to disgrace her, and I can&rsquo;t tell you
      what. Everything is so miserable! She says it&rsquo;s all the money, and that
      she knew from the first how it would be. And I&rsquo;m afraid some of what she
      says is true, I am indeed, Emma. But things happen in a way you could
      never think. I half wish myself the money had never come. It&rsquo;s making us
      all miserable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma listened, expecting from phrase to phrase some word which would be to
      her a terrible enlightenment But Alice had ceased, and the word still
      unspoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You say he sent me a message?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not ask directly the cause of Mrs. Mutimer&rsquo;s anger. Instinct told
      her that to hear the message would explain all else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Emma, I&rsquo;m afraid to tell you. You&rsquo;ll blame <i>me</i>, like mother did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shan&rsquo;t blame you, Alice. Will you please tell me the message?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma&rsquo;s lips seemed to speak without her volition. The rest o her face was
      fixed and cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s married, Emma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He asked you to tell me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice was surprised at the self-restraint proved by so quiet an
      interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he did. Emma, I&rsquo;m so, so sorry! If only you&rsquo;ll believe I&rsquo;m sorry,
      Emma! He <i>made</i> me come and tell you. He said if I didn&rsquo;t you&rsquo;d have
      to find out by chance, because he couldn&rsquo;t for shame tell you himself. And
      he couldn&rsquo;t tell mother neither. I&rsquo;ve had it all to do. If you knew what
      I&rsquo;ve gone through with mother! It&rsquo;s very hard that other people should
      suffer so much just on his account. I am really sorry for you, Emma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is it he&rsquo;s married?&rsquo; Emma asked. Probably all the last speech had
      been but a vague murmur to her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some one at Wanley.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A lady?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I suppose she&rsquo;s a lady.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t see her, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I saw her. I don&rsquo;t like her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Alice meant this to be soothing. Emma knew it, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think she cares much after all,&rsquo; Alice said to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But was that the message?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only to tell you of it, Emma. There was something else,&rsquo; she added
      immediately; &lsquo;not exactly a message, but he told me, and I dare say he
      thought I should let you know. He said that of course you were to have the
      money still as usual.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the listener&rsquo;s face came a cloud, a deep, turbid red. It was not
      anger, but shame which rose from the depths of her being. Her head sank;
      she turned and walked aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not angry with <i>me</i>, Emma?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not angry at all, Alice,&rsquo; was the reply in a monotone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must say good-bye now. I hope you won t take on much. And I hope Jane
      &lsquo;ll soon be better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you. I must go up to her; she doesn&rsquo;t like me to be away long.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice went before up the kitchen stairs, the dark, narrow stairs which now
      seemed to her so poverty-stricken. Emma did not speak, but pressed her
      hand at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate stood above her on the first landing, and, as Emma came up,
      whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has he come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something has hindered him.&rsquo; And Emma added, &lsquo;He couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, I think he ought to have helped it,&rsquo; said the other tartly.
      &lsquo;When does he mean to come, I&rsquo;d like to know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s uncertain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma passed into the sick-room. Her sister followed her with eyes of
      ill-content, then returned to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane lay against pillows. Red light from the fire played over her face,
      which was wasted beyond recognition. She looked a handmaiden of Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The atmosphere of the room was warm and sickly. A small green-shaded lamp
      stood by the looking-glass in front of the window; it cast a disk of light
      below, and on the ceiling concentric rings of light and shade, which
      flickered ceaselessly, and were at times all but obliterated in a gleam
      from the fireplace. A kettle sang on the trivet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sick girl&rsquo;s hands lay on the counterpane; one of them moved as Emma
      came to the bedside, and rested when the warmer fingers clasped it. There
      was eager inquiry in the sunken eyes; her hand tried to raise itself, but
      in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did Alice say?&rsquo; she asked, in quick feeble tones. &lsquo;Is he coming?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not for Christmas, I&rsquo;m afraid, dear. He&rsquo;s still very busy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But he sent you a message?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. He would have come if he could.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you tell Alice I wanted to see her? Why didn&rsquo;t she come up? Why did
      she stay such a short time?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She couldn&rsquo;t stay to-night, Jane. Are you easy still, love?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I did so want to see her. Why couldn&rsquo;t she stop, Emma? It wasn&rsquo;t kind
      of her to go without seeing me. I&rsquo;d have made time if it had been her as
      was lying in bed. And he doesn&rsquo;t even answer what I wrote to him. It was
      such work to write&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t now; and he might have answered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He very seldom writes to any one, you know, Jane. He has so little time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Little time! I have less, Emma, and he must know that. It&rsquo;s unkind of
      him. What did Alice tell you? Why did he want her to go there? Tell me
      everything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma felt the sunken eyes burning her with their eager look. She
      hesitated, pretended to think of something that had to be done, and the
      eyes burned more and more. Jane made repeated efforts to raise herself, as
      if to get a fuller view of her sister&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I move you?&rsquo; Emma asked. &lsquo;Would you like another pillow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; was the impatient answer. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go away from me; don&rsquo;t take
      your hand away. I want to know all that Alice said. You haven&rsquo;t any
      secrets from me, Emmy. Why <i>does</i> he stay away so long? It seems
      years since he came to see you. It&rsquo;s wrong of him. There&rsquo;s no business
      ought to keep him away all this time. Look at me, and tell me what she
      said.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only that he hadn&rsquo;t time. Dear, you mustn&rsquo;t excite yourself so. Isn&rsquo;t it
      all right, Jane, as long as I don&rsquo;t mind it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you look away from me? No, it isn&rsquo;t all right. Oh, I can&rsquo;t rest, I
      can&rsquo;t lie here! Why haven&rsquo;t I strength to go and say to him what I want to
      say? I thought it was him when the knock came. When Kate told me it
      wasn&rsquo;t, I felt as if my heart was sinking down; and I don&rsquo;t seem to have
      no tears left to cry. It &lsquo;ud ease me a little if I could. And now <i>you&rsquo;re</i>
      beginning to have secrets. Emmy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a cry of anguish. The mention of tears had brought them to Emma&rsquo;s
      eyes, for they lurked very near the surface, and Jane had seen the
      firelight touch on a moist cheek. For an instant she raised herself from
      the pillows. Emma folded soft arms about her and pressed her cheek against
      the heat which consumed her sister&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Emmy, I must know,&rsquo; wailed the sick girl. &lsquo;Is it what I&rsquo;ve been afraid
      of? No, not that! Is it the worst of all? You must tell me now. You don&rsquo;t
      love me if you keep away the truth. I can&rsquo;t have anything between you and
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A dry sob choked her; she gasped for breath. Emma, fearful lest the very
      life was escaping from her embrace, drew away and looked in anguish. Her
      involuntary tears had ceased, but she could no longer practise deception.
      The cost to Jane was greater perhaps than if she knew the truth. At least
      their souls must be united ere it was too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The truth, Emmy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will tell it you, darling,&rsquo; she replied, with quiet sadness. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s for
      him that I&rsquo;m sorry. I never thought anything could tempt him to break his
      word. Think of it in the same way as I do, dear-sister; don&rsquo;t be sorry for
      me, but for him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s never coming? He won&rsquo;t marry you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s already married, Jane. Alice came to tell me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she would have raised herself, but this time there was no strength.
      Not even her arms could she lift from the coverlets. But Emma saw the vain
      effort, raised the thin arms, put them about her neck, and held her sister
      to her heart as if for eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Darling, darling, it isn&rsquo;t hard to bear. I care for nothing but your
      love. Live for my sake, dearest dear; I have forgotten every one and
      everything but you. It&rsquo;s so much better. I couldn&rsquo;t have changed my life
      so; I was never meant to be rich. It seems unkind of him, but in a little
      time we shall see it was best. Only you, Janey; you have my whole heart,
      and I&rsquo;m so glad to feel it is so. Live, and I&rsquo;ll give every minute of my
      life to loving you, poor sufferer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane could not breathe sound into the words she would have spoken. She lay
      with her eyes watching the fire-play on the ceiling. Her respiration was
      quick and feeble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer&rsquo;s name was not mentioned by either again that night, by one of
      them never again. Such silence was his punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate entered the room a little before midnight. She saw one of Jane&rsquo;s
      hands raised to impose silence. Emma, still sitting by the bedside, slept;
      her head rested on the pillows. The sick had become the watcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;d better go to bed,&rsquo; Kate whispered. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll wake her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no You needn&rsquo;t stay, Kate. I don&rsquo;t want anything. Let her sleep as
      she is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder sister left the room. Then Jane approached her head to that of
      the sleeper, softly, softly, and her arm stole across Emma&rsquo;s bosom and
      rested on her farther shoulder. The fire burned with little whispering
      tongues of flame; the circles of light and shade quivered above the lamp.
      Abroad the snow fell and froze upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later Alice Mutimer, as she sat at breakfast, was told that a
      visitor named Mrs. Clay desired to see her. It was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock;
      Alice had no passion for early rising, and since her mother&rsquo;s retirement
      from the common table she breakfasted alone at any hour which seemed good
      to her. &lsquo;Arry always&mdash;or nearly always&mdash;left the house at eight
      o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clay was introduced into the dining-room. Alice received her with an
      anxious face, for she was anticipating trouble from the house in Wilton
      Square. But the trouble was other than she had in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jane died at four o&rsquo;clock this morning,&rsquo; the visitor began, without
      agitation, in the quick, unsympathetic voice which she always used when
      her equanimity was in any way disturbed. &lsquo;Emma hasn&rsquo;t closed her eyes for
      two days and nights, and now I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if she&rsquo;s going to be ill
      herself. I made her lie down, and then came out just to ask you to write
      to your brother. Surely he&rsquo;ll come now. I don&rsquo;t know what to do about the
      burying; we ought to have some one to help us. I expected your mother
      would be coming to see us, but she&rsquo;s kept away all at once. Will you write
      to Dick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice was concerned to perceive that Kate was still unenlightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did Emma know you were coming?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I suppose she did. But it&rsquo;s hard to get her to attend to anything.
      I&rsquo;ve left her alone, &lsquo;cause there wasn&rsquo;t any one I could fetch at once.
      Will you write to-day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll see to it,&rsquo; said Alice. &lsquo;Have some breakfast, will you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind just a cup o&rsquo; coffee. It&rsquo;s very cold, and I had to
      walk a long way before I could get a &lsquo;bus.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Kate refreshed herself, Alice played nervously with her tea-spoon,
      trying to make up her mind what must be done. The situation was
      complicated with many miseries, but Alice had experienced a growth of
      independence since her return from Wanley. All she had seen and heard
      whilst with her brother had an effect upon her in the afterthought, and
      her mother&rsquo;s abrupt surrender into her hands of the household control gave
      her, when she had time to realise it, a sense of increased importance not
      at all disagreeable. Already she had hired a capable servant in addition
      to the scrubby maid-of-all-work who had sufficed for Mrs. Mutimer, and it
      was her intention that henceforth domestic arrangements should be
      established on quite another basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll telegraph to Dick,&rsquo; she said, presently. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt he&rsquo;ll see
      that everything&rsquo;s done properly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But won&rsquo;t he come himself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is your mother in?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s not very well; I don&rsquo;t think I must disturb her with bad news. Tell
      Emma I&rsquo;m very sorry, will you? I do hope she isn&rsquo;t going to be ill. You
      must see that she gets rest now. Was it sudden?&rsquo; she added, showing in her
      face how little disposed she was to dwell on such gloomy subjects as death
      and burial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She was wandering all yesterday. I don&rsquo;t think she knew anything after
      eight o&rsquo;clock last night. She went off in a sleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When the visitor had gone, Alice drove to the nearest telegraph office and
      despatched a message to her brother, giving the news and asking what
      should be done. By three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon no reply had yet
      arrived; but shortly after Mr. Keene presented himself at the house. Alice
      had not seen him since her return. He bowed to her with extreme gravity,
      and spoke in a subdued voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I grieve that I have lost time, Miss Mutimer. Important business had
      taken me from home, and on my return I found a telegram from Wanley. Your
      brother directs me to wait upon you at once, on a very sad subject, I
      fear. He instructs me to purchase a grave in Manor Park Cemetery. No near
      relative, I trust?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, only a friend,&rsquo; Alice replied. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve heard me speak of a girl
      called Emma Vine. It&rsquo;s a sister of hers. She died this morning, and they
      want help about the funeral.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Precisely, precisely. You know with what zeal I hasten to perform your&rsquo;&mdash;a
      slight emphasis on this word&mdash;&lsquo;brother&rsquo;s pleasure, be the business
      what it may. I&rsquo;ll see about it at once. I was to say to you that your
      brother would be in town this evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, very well. But you needn&rsquo;t look so gloomy, you know, Mr. Keene. I&rsquo;m
      very sorry, but then she&rsquo;s been ill for a very long time, and it&rsquo;s really
      almost a relief&mdash;to her sisters, I mean.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I trust you enjoyed your visit to Wanley, Miss Mutimer?&rsquo; said Keene,
      still preserving his very respectful tone and bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, thanks. I dare say I shall go there again before very long. No
      doubt you&rsquo;ll be glad to hear that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will try to be, Miss Mutimer. I trust that your pleasure is my first
      consideration in life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice was, to speak vulgarly, practising on Mr. Keene. He was her first
      visitor since she had entered upon rule, and she had a double satisfaction
      in subduing him with airs and graces. She did not trouble to reflect that
      under the circumstances he might think her rather heartless, and indeed
      hypocrisy was not one of her failings. Her <i>naivete</i> constituted such
      charm as she possessed; in the absence of any deep qualities it might be
      deemed a virtue, for it was inconsistent with serious deception.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose you mean you&rsquo;d really much rather I stayed here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Keene eyed her with observation. He himself had slight depth for a man
      doomed to live by his wits, and he was under the disadvantage of really
      feeling something of what he said. He was not a rascal by predilection;
      merely driven that way by the forces which in our social state abundantly
      make for rascality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Mutimer,&rsquo; he replied, with a stage sigh, &lsquo;why do you tempt my
      weakness? I am on my honour; I am endeavouring to earn your good opinion.
      Spare me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s no harm in you, Mr. Keene. I suppose you&rsquo;d better go
      and see after your&mdash;your business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are right. I go at once, Princess. I may call you Princess?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know about that. Of course only when there&rsquo;s no one else in
      the room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I shall think it always.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I can&rsquo;t prevent, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, I fear you mean nothing, Miss Mutimer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his leave, and Alice enjoyed reflecting upon the dialogue, which
      certainly had meant nothing for her in any graver sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, that&rsquo;s what the books call <i>flirtation</i>,&rsquo; she said to herself.
      &lsquo;I think I can do that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And on the whole she could, vastly better than might have been expected of
      her birth and breeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o&rsquo;clock a note was delivered for her. Richard wrote from an hotel
      in the neighbourhood, asking her to come to him. She found him in a
      private sitting-room, taking a meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come to the house?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;You knew mother never
      comes down-stairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard looked at her with lowered brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean to say she&rsquo;s doing that in earnest?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That she is She comes down early in the morning and gets all the food she
      wants for the day. I heard her cooking something in a frying-pan to-day.
      She hasn&rsquo;t been out of the house yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does she know about Jane?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. I know what it would be if I went and told her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He ate in silence. Alice waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must go and see Emma,&rsquo; was his next remark. &lsquo;Tell her there&rsquo;s a grave
      in Manor Park Cemetery; her father and mother were buried there, you know.
      Keene &lsquo;ll look after it all and he&rsquo;ll come and tell you what to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did you come up?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t talk about these things in letters. You&rsquo;ll have to tell
      mother; she might want to go to the funeral.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see why I should do all your disagreeable work, Dick!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, don&rsquo;t do it,&rsquo; he replied sullenly, throwing down his knife and
      fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      A scene of wrangling followed, without violence, but of the kind which is
      at once a cause and an effect of demoralisation. The old disagreements
      between them had been in another tone, at all events on Richard&rsquo;s side,
      for they had arisen from his earnest disapproval of frivolities and the
      like. Richard could no longer speak in that way. To lose the power of
      honest reproof in consequence of a moral lapse is to any man a
      wide-reaching calamity; to a man of Mutimer&rsquo;s calibre it meant disaster of
      which the end could not be foreseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Alice yielded; her affection and Richard&rsquo;s superior force always
      made it a foregone result that she should do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you won&rsquo;t come and see mother?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. She&rsquo;s behaving foolishly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s precious dull at home, I can tell you. I can&rsquo;t go on much longer
      without friends of some kind. I&rsquo;ve a good mind to marry Mr. Keene, just
      for a change.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard started up, with his fist on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean to say he&rsquo;s been talking to you in that way?&rsquo; he cried
      angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice had spoken with thoughtless petulance. She hastened eagerly to
      correct her error.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As if I meant it! Don&rsquo;t be stupid, Dick. Of course he hasn&rsquo;t said a word;
      I believe he&rsquo;s engaged to somebody; I thought so from something he said a
      little while ago. The idea of me marrying a man like that!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He examined her closely, and Alice was not afraid of telltale cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d be such a fool. If I thought there was any
      danger of that, I&rsquo;d soon stop it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you, indeed! Why, that would be just the way to make me say I&rsquo;d
      have him. You&rsquo;d have known that if only you read novels.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Novels!&rsquo; he exclaimed, with profound contempt. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go playing with
      that kind of thing; it&rsquo;s dangerous. At least you can wait a week or two
      longer. I&rsquo;ve only let him see so much of you because I felt sure you&rsquo;d got
      common sense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I have. But what&rsquo;s to happen in a week or two?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think you might come to Wanley for a little. We shall see. If
      mother had only &lsquo;Arry in the house, she might come back to her senses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I tell her you&rsquo;ve been to London?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can if you like,&rsquo; he replied, with a show of indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane Vine was buried on Sunday afternoon, her sisters alone accompanying
      her to the grave. Alice had with difficulty obtained admission to her
      mother&rsquo;s room, and it seemed to her that the news she brought was received
      with little emotion. The old woman had an air of dogged weariness; she did
      not look her daughter in the face, and spoke only in monosyllables. Her
      face was yellow, her cheeks like wrinkled parchment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manor Park Cemetery lies in the remote East End, and gives sleeping-places
      to the inhabitants of a vast district. There Jane&rsquo;s parents lay, not in a
      grave to themselves, but buried amidst the nameless dead, in that part of
      the ground reserved for those who can purchase no more than a portion in
      the foss which is filled when its occupants reach statutable distance from
      the surface. The regions around were then being built upon for the first
      time; the familiar streets of pale, damp brick were stretching here and
      there, continuing London, much like the spreading of a disease. Epping
      Forest is near at hand, and nearer the dreary expanse of Wanstead Flats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not grief, but chill desolation makes this cemetery its abode. A country
      churchyard touches the tenderest memories, and softens the heart with
      longing for the eternal rest. The cemeteries of wealthy London abound in
      dear and great associations, or at worst preach homilies which connect
      themselves with human dignity and pride. Here on the waste limits of that
      dread East, to wander among tombs is to go hand in hand with the stark and
      eyeless emblem of mortality; the spirit falls beneath the cold burden of
      ignoble destiny. Here lie those who were born for toll; who, when toil has
      worn them to the uttermost, have but to yield their useless breath and
      pass into oblivion. For them is no day, only the brief twilight of a
      winter sky between the former and the latter night For them no aspiration;
      for them no hope of memory in the dust; their very children are wearied
      into forgetfulness. Indistinguishable units in the vast throng that
      labours but to support life, the name of each, father, mother, child, is
      as a dumb cry for the warmth and love of which Fate so stinted them. The
      wind wails above their narrow tenements; the sandy soil, soaking in the
      rain as soon as it has fallen, is a symbol of the great world which
      absorbs their toil and straightway blots their being.
    </p>
    <p>
      It being Sunday afternoon the number of funerals was considerable; even to
      bury their dead the toilers cannot lose a day of the wage week. Around the
      chapel was a great collection of black vehicles with sham-tailed mortuary
      horses; several of the families present must have left themselves bare in
      order to clothe a coffin in the way they deemed seemly. Emma and her
      sister had made their own funeral garments, and the former, in consenting
      for the sake of poor Jane to receive the aid which Mutimer offered, had
      insisted through Alice that there should be no expenditure beyond the
      strictly needful. The carriage which conveyed her and Kate alone followed
      the hearse from Hoxton; it rattled along at a merry pace, for the way was
      lengthy, and a bitter wind urged men and horses to speed. The occupants of
      the box kept up a jesting colloquy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Impossible to read the burial service over each of the dead separately;
      time would not allow it. Emma and Kate found themselves crowded among a
      number of sobbing women, just in time to seat themselves before the
      service began. Neither of them had moist eyes; the elder looked about the
      chapel with blank gaze, often shivering with cold; Emma&rsquo;s face was bent
      downwards, deadly pale, set in unchanging woe. A world had fallen to
      pieces about her; she did not feel the ground upon which she trod; there
      seemed no way from amid the ruins. She had no strong religious faith; a
      wail in the darkness was all the expression her heart could attain to; in
      the present anguish she could not turn her thoughts to that far vision of
      a life hereafter. All day she had striven to realise that a box of wood
      contained all that was left of her sister. The voice of the clergyman
      struck her ear with meaningless monotony. Not immortality did she ask for,
      but one more whisper from the lips that could not speak, one throb of the
      heart she had striven so despairingly to warm against her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate was plucking at her arm, for the service was over, and unconsciously
      she was impeding people who wished to pass from the seats. With difficulty
      she rose and walked; the cold seemed to have checked the flow of her
      blood; she noticed the breath rising from her mouth, and wondered that she
      could have so much whilst those dear lips were breathless. Then she was
      being led over hard snow, towards a place where men stood, where there was
      new-turned earth, where a coffin lay upon the ground. She suffered the
      sound of more words which she could not follow, then heard the dull
      falling of clods upon hollow wood. A hand seemed to clutch her throat, she
      struggled convulsively and cried aloud. But the tears would not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      No memory of the return home dwelt afterwards in her mind. The white
      earth, the headstones sprinkled with snow, the vast grey sky over which
      darkness was already creeping, the wind and the clergyman&rsquo;s voice joining
      in woful chant, these alone remained with her to mark the day. Between it
      and the days which then commenced lay formless void.

    <p>
      On Tuesday morning Alice Mutimer came to the house. Mrs. Clay chanced to
      be from home; Emma received the visitor and led her down into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad you have come,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;I wanted to see you to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you feeling better?&rsquo; Alice asked. She tried in vain to speak with the
      friendliness of past days; that could never be restored. Her advantages of
      person and dress were no help against the embarrassment caused in her by
      the simple dignity of the wronged and sorrowing girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma replied that she was better, then asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you come only to see me; or for something else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wanted to know how you were; but I&rsquo;ve brought you something as well&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She took an envelope from within her muff. Emma shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, nothing more,&rsquo; she said, in a tone removed alike from resentment and
      from pathos; &lsquo;I want you, please, to say that we can t take anything after
      this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what are you going to do, Emma?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To leave this house and live as we did before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, but you can&rsquo;t do that What does Kate say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t told her yet; I&rsquo;m going to do so to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But she&rsquo;ll feel it very hard with the children.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The children were sitting together in a corner of the kitchen. Emma
      glanced at them, and saw that Bertie, the elder, was listening with a
      surprised look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rsquo; she replied simply, &lsquo;but we have no choice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice had an impulse of generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then take it from <i>me</i>,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t mind that. You know I
      have plenty of my own. Live here and let one or two of the rooms, and I&rsquo;ll
      lend you what you need till the business is doing well. Now you can&rsquo;t have
      anything to say against that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma still shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The business will never help us. We must go back to the old work; we can
      always live on that. I can&rsquo;t take anything from you, Alice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I think it&rsquo;s very unkind, Emma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps so, but I can&rsquo;t help it: It&rsquo;s kind of you to offer, I feel that;
      but I&rsquo;d rather work my fingers to the bone than touch one halfpenny now
      that I haven&rsquo;t earned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice bridled slightly and urged no more. She left before Kate returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the morning Emma strung herself to the effort of letting
      her sister know the true state of affairs. It was only what Kate had for a
      long time suspected, and she freely said as much, expressing her
      sentiments with fluent indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I know you won&rsquo;t hear of it,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but if I was in your
      place I&rsquo;d make him smart. I&rsquo;d have him up and make him pay, see if I
      wouldn&rsquo;t. Trust him, he knows you&rsquo;re too soft-hearted, and he takes
      advantage of you. It&rsquo;s girls like you as encourages men to think they can
      do as they like. You&rsquo;ve no right, you haven&rsquo;t, to let him off. I&rsquo;d have
      him in the newspapers and show him up, see if I wouldn&rsquo;t. And he shan&rsquo;t
      have it quite so easy as he thinks neither; I&rsquo;ll go about and tell
      everybody as I know. Only let him come a-lecturin&rsquo; hereabouts, that&rsquo;s
      all!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kate,&rsquo; broke in the other, &lsquo;if you do anything of the kind, I don&rsquo;t know
      how I shall speak to you again. Its not you he&rsquo;s harmed; you&rsquo;ve no right
      to spread talk about me It&rsquo;s my affair, and I must do as I think fit. It&rsquo;s
      all over and there&rsquo;s no occasion for neither you nor me to speak of him
      again I&rsquo;m going out this afternoon to find a room for us, and we shall be
      no worse off than we was before. We&rsquo;ve got to work, that&rsquo;s all, and to
      earn our living like other women do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sister stared incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean to say he&rsquo;s stopped sending money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have refused to take it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve done <i>what</i>? Well, of all the&mdash;!&rsquo; Comparisons failed
      her. &lsquo;And I&rsquo;ve got to take these children back again into a hole like the
      last? Not me! You do as you like; I suppose you know your own business.
      But if he doesn&rsquo;t send the money as usual, I&rsquo;ll find some way to make him,
      see if I don&rsquo;t! You&rsquo;re off your head, I think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma had anticipated this, and was prepared to bear the brunt of her
      sister&rsquo;s anger. Kate was not originally blessed with much sweetness of
      disposition, and an unhappy marriage had made her into a sour, nagging
      woman. But, in spite of her wretched temper and the low moral tone induced
      during her years of matrimony, she was not evil-natured, and her chief
      safeguard was affection for her sister Emma. This seldom declared itself,
      for she was of those unhappily constituted people who find nothing so hard
      as to betray the tenderness of which they are capable, and, as often as
      not, are driven by a miserable perversity to words and actions which seem
      quite inconsistent with such feeling. For Jane she had cared far less than
      for Emma, yet her grief at Jane&rsquo;s death was more than could be gathered
      from her demeanour. It had, in fact, resulted in a state of nervous
      irritableness; an outbreak of anger came to her as a relief, such as Emma
      had recently found in the shedding of tears. On her own account she felt
      strongly, but yet more on Emma&rsquo;s; coarse methods of revenge naturally
      suggested themselves to her, and to be thwarted drove her to exasperation.
      When Emma persisted in steady opposition, exerting all the force of her
      character to subdue her sister&rsquo;s ignoble purposes, Kate worked herself to
      frenzy. For more than an hour her voice was audible in the street, as she
      poured forth torrents of furious reproach and menace; all the time Emma
      stood patient and undaunted, her own anger often making terrible struggle
      for mastery, but ever finding itself subdued. For she, too, was of a
      passionate nature, but the treasures of sensibility which her heart
      enclosed consecrated all her being to noble ends. One invaluable aid she
      had in a contest such as this&mdash;her inability to grow sullen.
      Righteous anger might gleam in her eyes and quiver upon her lips, but the
      fire always burnt clear; it is smoulder that poisons the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew her sister, pitied her, always made for her the gentlest
      allowances. It would have been easy to stand aside, to disclaim
      responsibility, and let Kate do as she chose, but the easy course was
      never the one she chose when endurance promised better results. To resist
      to the uttermost, even to claim and exert the authority she derived from
      her suffering, was, she knew, the truest kindness to her sister. And in
      the end she prevailed. Kate tore her passion to tatters, then succumbed to
      exhaustion. But she did not fling out of the room, and this Emma knew to
      be a hopeful sign. The opportunity of strong, placid speech at length
      presented itself, and Emma used it well. She did not succeed in eliciting
      a promise, but when she declared her confidence in her sister&rsquo;s better
      self, Kate made no retort, only sat in stubborn muteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon Emma went forth to fulfil her intention of finding
      lodgings. She avoided the neighbourhood in which she had formerly lived,
      and after long search discovered what she wanted in a woful byway near Old
      Street. It was one room only, but larger than she had hoped to come upon;
      fortunately her own furniture had been preserved, and would now suffice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate remained sullen, but proved by her actions that she had surrendered;
      she began to pack her possessions. Emma wrote to Alice, announcing that
      the house was tenantless; she took the note to Highbury herself, and left
      it at the door, together with the house key. The removal was effected
      after nightfall.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Movements which appeal to the reason and virtue of humanity, and are
      consequently doomed to remain long in the speculative stage, prove their
      vitality by enduring the tests of schism. A Socialistic propaganda in
      times such as our own, an insistence upon the principles of Christianity
      in a modern Christian state, the advocacy of peace and good-will in an age
      when falsehood is the foundation of the social structure, and internecine
      warfare is presupposed in every compact between man and man, might
      anticipate that the test would come soon, and be of a stringent nature.
      Accordingly it did not surprise Mr. Westlake when he discerned the
      beginnings of commotion in the Union of which he represented the cultured
      and leading elements. A comrade named Roodhouse had of late been coming
      into prominence by addressing himself in fiery eloquence to open-air
      meetings, and at length had taken upon himself to more than hint that the
      movement was at a standstill owing to the lukewarmness (in guise of
      practical moderation) of those to whom its guidance had been entrusted.
      The reports of Comrade Roodhouse&rsquo;s lectures were of a nature that made it
      difficult for Mr. Westlake to print them in the &lsquo;Fiery Cross;&rsquo; one such
      report arrived at length, that of a meeting held on Clerkenwell Green on
      the first Sunday of the new year, to which the editor refused admission.
      The comrade who made it his business to pen notes of the new apostle&rsquo;s
      glowing words, had represented him as referring to the recognised leader
      in such very uncompromising terms, that to publish the report in the
      official columns would have been stultifying. In the lecture in question
      Roodhouse declared his adherence to the principles of assassination; he
      pronounced them the sole working principles; to deny to Socialists the
      right of assassination was to rob them of the very sinews of war. Men who
      affected to be revolutionists, but were in reality nothing more than
      rose-water romancers, would of course object to anything which looked like
      business; they liked to sit in their comfortable studies and pen daintily
      worded articles, thus earning for themselves a humanitarian reputation at
      a very cheap rate. That would not do; <i>&amp;#224; bas</i> all such
      penny-a-liner pretence! Blood and iron! that must be the revolutionists&rsquo; 
      watchword. Was it not by blood and iron that the present damnable system
      was maintained? To arms, then secretly, of course. Let tyrants be made to
      tremble upon their thrones in more countries than Russia. Let capitalists
      fear to walk in the daylight. This only was the path of progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was thought by the judicious that Comrade Roodhouse would, if he
      repeated this oration, find himself the subject of a rather ugly
      indictment. For the present, however, his words were ignored, save in the
      Socialist body. To them, of course, he had addressed himself, and
      doubtless he was willing to run a little risk for the sake of a most
      practical end, that of splitting the party, and thus establishing a
      sovereignty for himself; this done, he could in future be more guarded.
      His reporter purposely sent &lsquo;copy&rsquo; to Mr. Westlake which could not be
      printed, and the rejection of the report was the signal for secession.
      Comrade Roodhouse printed at his own expense a considerable number of
      leaflets, and sowed them broadcast in the Socialist meeting-places. There
      were not wanting disaffected brethren, who perused these appeals with
      satisfaction. Schism flourished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comrade Roodhouse was of course a man of no means, but he numbered among
      his followers two extremely serviceable men, one of them a practical
      printer who carried on a small business in Camden Town; the other an oil
      merchant, who, because his profits had never exceeded a squalid two
      thousand a year, whereas another oil merchant of his acquaintance made at
      least twice as much, was embittered against things in general, and ready
      to assist any subversionary movement, yea, even with coin of the realm, on
      the one condition that he should be allowed to insert articles of his own
      composition in the new organ which it was proposed to establish. There was
      no difficulty in conceding this trifle, and the &lsquo;Tocsin&rsquo; was the result.
      The name was a suggestion of the oil merchant himself, and no bad name if
      Socialists at large could be supposed capable of understanding it; but the
      oil merchant was too important a man to be thwarted, and the argument by
      which he supported his choice was incontestable. &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it our aim to
      educate the people? Very well, then let them begin by knowing what Tocsin
      means. I shouldn&rsquo;t know myself if I hadn&rsquo;t come across it in the newspaper
      and looked it up in the dictionary; so there you are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was the &lsquo;Tocsin,&rsquo; a weekly paper like the &lsquo;Fiery Cross.&rsquo; The
      first number appeared in the middle of February, so admirably prepared
      were the plans of Comrade Roodhouse. It appeared on Friday; the next
      Sunday promised to be a lively day at Commonwealth Hall and elsewhere. At
      the original head-quarters of the Union addresses were promised from two
      leading men, Comrades Westlake and Mutimer. Comrade Roodhouse would in the
      morning address an assembly on Clerkenwell Green; in the evening his voice
      would summon adherents to the meeting-place in Hoxton which had been the
      scene of our friend Richard&rsquo;s earliest triumphs. With few exceptions the
      Socialists of that region had gone over to the new man and the new paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard arrived in town on the Saturday, and went to the house in
      Highbury, whither disagreeable business once more summoned him. Alice,
      who, owing to her mother&rsquo;s resolute refusal to direct the household, had
      not as yet been able to spend more than a day or two with Richard and his
      wife, sent nothing but ill news to Wanley. Mrs. Mutimer seemed to be
      breaking down in health, and &lsquo;Arry was undisguisedly returning to evil
      ways. For the former, it was suspected&mdash;a locked door prevented
      certainty&mdash;that she had of late kept her bed the greater part of the
      day; a servant who met her downstairs in the early morning reported that
      she &lsquo;looked very bad indeed.&rsquo; The case of the latter was as hard to deal
      with. &lsquo;Arry had long ceased to attend his classes with any regularity, and
      he was once more asserting the freeman&rsquo;s right to immunity from day
      labour. Moreover, he claimed in practice the freeman&rsquo;s right to get drunk
      four nights out of the seven. No one knew whence he got his money; Richard
      purposely stinted him, but the provision was useless. Mr. Keene declared
      with lamentations that his influence over &lsquo;Arry was at an end; nay, the
      youth had so far forgotten gratitude as to frankly announce his intention
      of &lsquo;knockin&rsquo; Keene&rsquo;s lights out&rsquo; if he were further interfered with. To
      the journalist his &lsquo;lights&rsquo; were indispensable; in no sense of the word
      did he possess too many of them; so it was clear that he must abdicate his
      tutorial functions. Alice implored her brother to come and &lsquo;do something.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard, though a married man of only six weeks&rsquo; standing, had troubles
      altogether in excess of his satisfactions. Things were not as they should
      have been in that earthly paradise called New Wanley. It was not to be
      expected that the profits of that undertaking would be worth speaking of
      for some little time to come, but it was extremely desirable that it
      should pay its own expenses, and it began to be doubtful whether even this
      moderate success was being achieved. Various members of the directing
      committee had visited New Wanley recently, and Richard had talked to them
      in a somewhat discouraging tone; his fortune was not limitless, it had to
      be remembered; a considerable portion of old Mutimer&rsquo;s money had lain in
      the vast Belwick concern of which he was senior partner; the surviving
      members of the firm were under no specified obligation to receive Richard
      himself as partner, and the product of the realised capital was a very
      different thing from the share in the profits which the old man had
      enjoyed. Other capital Richard had at his command, but already he was
      growing chary of encroachments upon principal. He began to murmur inwardly
      that the entire fortune did not lie at his disposal; willingly he would
      have allowed Alice a handsome portion; and as for &lsquo;Arry, the inheritance
      was clearly going to be his ruin. The practical difficulties at New Wanley
      were proving considerable; the affair was viewed with hostility by
      ironmasters in general, and the results of such hostility were felt. But
      Richard was committed to his scheme; all his ambitions based themselves
      thereupon. And those ambitions grew daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      These greater troubles must to a certain extent solve themselves, but in
      Highbury it was evidently time, as Alice said, to &lsquo;do something.&rsquo; His
      mother&rsquo;s obstinacy stood in the way of almost every scheme that suggested
      itself. Richard was losing patience with the poor old woman, and suffered
      the more from his irritation because he would so gladly have behaved to
      her with filial kindness. One plan there was to which she might possibly
      agree, and even have pleasure in accepting it, but it was not easy to
      propose. The house in Wilton Square was still on his hands; upon the
      departure of Emma and her sister; a certain Mrs. Chattaway, a poor friend
      of old times, who somehow supported herself and a grandchild, had been put
      into the house as caretaker, for Richard could not sell all the furniture
      to which his mother was so attached, and he had waited for her return to
      reason before ultimately deciding how to act in that matter. Could he now
      ask the old woman to return to the Square, and, it might be, live there
      with Mrs. Chattaway? In that case both &lsquo;Arry and Alice would have to leave
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday afternoon he had a long talk with his sister. To Alice also it
      had occurred that their mother&rsquo;s return to the old abode might be
      desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you may depend upon it, Dick,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;she&rsquo;ll never rest again
      till she does get back. I believe you&rsquo;ve only got to speak of it, and
      she&rsquo;ll go at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll think it unkind,&rsquo; Richard objected. &lsquo;It looks as if we wanted to
      get her out of the way. Why on earth does she carry on like this? As if we
      hadn&rsquo;t bother enough!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t help what she thinks. I believe it&rsquo;ll be for her own good.
      She&rsquo;ll be comfortable with Mrs. Chattaway, and that&rsquo;s more than she&rsquo;ll
      ever be here. But what about &lsquo;Arry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll have to come to Wanley. I shall find him work there&mdash;I wish
      I&rsquo;d done so months ago.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no longer the objections to &lsquo;Arry&rsquo;s appearance at Wanley that
      had existed previous to Richard&rsquo;s marriage; none the less the resolution
      was courageous, and proved the depth of Mutimer&rsquo;s anxiety for his brother.
      Having got the old woman to Wilton Square, and Alice to the Manor, it
      would have been easy enough to bid Mr. Henry Mutimer betake himself&mdash;whither
      his mind directed him. Richard could not adopt that rough-and-ready way
      out of his difficulty. Just as he suffered in the thought that he might be
      treating his mother unkindly, so he was constrained to undergo annoyances
      rather than abandon the hope of saving &lsquo;Arry from ultimate destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will he live at the Manor?&rsquo; Alice asked uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard mused; then a most happy idea struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have it! He shall live with Rodman. The very thing! Rodman&rsquo;s the fellow
      to look after him. Yes; that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I&rsquo;m to live at the Manor?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think Adela won&rsquo;t mind?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mind? How the deuce can she mind it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of form Adela would of course be consulted, but Richard had no
      notion of submitting practical arrangements in his own household to his
      wife&rsquo;s decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now we shall have to see mother,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;How&rsquo;s that to be managed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you go and speak at her door?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That be hanged! Confound it, has she gone crazy? Just go up and say I
      want to see her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I say that, I&rsquo;m quite sure she won&rsquo;t come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard waxed in anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But she <i>shall</i> come! Go and say I want to see her, and that if she
      doesn&rsquo;t come down I&rsquo;ll force the door. There&rsquo;ll have to be an end to this
      damned foolery. I&rsquo;ve got no time to spend humbugging. It&rsquo;s four o&rsquo;clock,
      and I have letters to write before dinner. Tell her I must see her, and
      have done with it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice went upstairs with small hope of success. She knocked twice before
      receiving an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother, are you there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; came back in a voice of irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dick&rsquo;s here, and wants to speak to you. He says he <i>must</i> see you;
      it&rsquo;s something very important.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to do with him,&rsquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you see him if he comes up here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I won&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice went down and repeated this. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation Mutimer
      ascended the stairs by threes. He rapped loudly at the bedroom door. No
      answer was vouchsafed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother, you must either open the door or come downstairs,&rsquo; he cried with
      decision. &lsquo;This has gone on long enough. Which will you do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do neither,&rsquo; was the angry reply. &lsquo;What right have you to order me
      about, I&rsquo;d like to know? You mind your business, and I&rsquo;ll mind mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right. Then I shall send for a man at once, and have the door
      forced.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mutimer knew well the tone in which these words were spoken; more
      than once ere now it had been the preliminary of decided action. Already
      Richard had reached the head of the stairs, when he heard a key turn, and
      the bedroom door was thrown open with such violence that the walls shook.
      He approached the threshold and examined the interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one noticeable change in the appearance of the bedroom
      since he had last seen it. The dressing-table was drawn near to the fire,
      and on it were a cup and saucer, a few plates, some knives, forks, and
      spoons, and a folded tablecloth. A kettle and a saucepan stood on the
      fender. Her bread and butter Mrs. Mutimer kept in a drawer. All the
      appointments of the chamber were as clean and orderly as could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of his mother&rsquo;s face all but stilled Richard&rsquo;s anger; she was
      yellow and wasted; her hair seemed far more grizzled than he remembered
      it. She stood as far from him as she could get, in an attitude not devoid
      of dignity, and looked him straight in the face. He closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother, I&rsquo;ve not come here to quarrel with you,&rsquo; Mutimer began, his voice
      much softened. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s done is done, and there&rsquo;s no helping it. I can
      understand you being angry at first, but there&rsquo;s no sense in making
      enemies of us all in this way. It can&rsquo;t go on any longer&mdash;neither for
      your sake nor ours. I want to talk reasonably, and to make some kind of
      arrangement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You want to get me out o&rsquo; the &lsquo;ouse. I&rsquo;m ready to go, an&rsquo; glad to go.
      I&rsquo;ve earnt my livin&rsquo; before now, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not so old but I can do it again.
      You always was one for talkin&rsquo;, but the fewest words is best. Them as
      talks most isn&rsquo;t allus the most straightfor&rsquo;ard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t that kind of talk that&rsquo;ll do any good, mother. I tell you again,
      I&rsquo;m not going to use angry words; You know perfectly well I&rsquo;ve never
      behaved badly to you, and I&rsquo;m not going to begin now. What I&rsquo;ve got to say
      is that you&rsquo;ve no right to go on like this. Whilst you&rsquo;ve been shutting
      yourself up in this room, there&rsquo;s Alice living by herself, which it isn&rsquo;t
      right she should do; and there&rsquo;s &lsquo;Arry going to the bad as fast as he can,
      and just because you won&rsquo;t help to look after him. If you&rsquo;ll only think of
      it in the right way, you&rsquo;ll see that&rsquo;s a good deal your doing. If &lsquo;Arry
      turns out a scamp and a blackguard, it&rsquo;s you that &lsquo;ll be greatly to blame
      for it. You might have helped to look after him. I always thought you&rsquo;d
      more common sense. You may say what you like about me, and I don&rsquo;t care;
      but when you talk about working for your living, you ought to remember
      that there&rsquo;s work enough near at hand, if only you&rsquo;d see to it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to do neither with you nor &lsquo;Arry nor Alice,&rsquo; answered the
      old woman stubbornly. &lsquo;If &lsquo;Arry disgraces his name, he won&rsquo;t be the first
      as has done it. I done my best to bring you all up honest, but that was a
      long time ago, and things has changed. You&rsquo;re old enough to go your own
      ways, an&rsquo; your ways isn&rsquo;t mine. I told you how it &lsquo;ud be, an&rsquo; the only
      mistake I made was comin&rsquo; to live here at all. Now I can&rsquo;t be left alone,
      an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll go. You&rsquo;ve no call to tell me a second time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long, miserable wrangle, lasting half an hour, before a
      possibility of agreement presented itself. Richard at length ceased to
      recriminate, and allowed his mother to talk herself to satiety. He then
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of giving up this house, mother. What I want to know is,
      whether it would please you to go back to the old place again? I ask you
      because I can think of ud other way for putting you in comfort. You must
      say and think what you like, only just answer me the one question as I ask
      it&mdash;that is, honestly and good-temperedly. I shall have to take &lsquo;Arry
      away with me; I can&rsquo;t let him go to the dogs without another try to keep
      him straight. Alice &lsquo;ll have to go with me too, at all events for a time.
      Whether we like it or not, she&rsquo;ll have to accustom herself to new ways,
      and I see my way to helping her. I don&rsquo;t know whether you&rsquo;ve been told
      that Mrs. Chattaway&rsquo;s been living in the house since the others went away.
      The furniture&rsquo;s just as you left it; I dare say you&rsquo;d feel it like going
      home again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;ve gone, have they?&rsquo; Mrs. Mutimer asked, as if unwilling to show the
      interest which this proposal had excited in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, they went more than a month ago. We put Mrs. Chattaway in just to
      keep the place in order. I look on the house as yours. You might let Mrs.
      Chattaway stay there still, perhaps; but that&rsquo;s just as you please. You
      oughtn&rsquo;t to live quite alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mutimer did not soften, but, after many words, Richard understood her
      to agree to what he proposed. She had stood all through the dialogue; now
      at length she moved to a seat, and sank upon it with trembling limbs.
      Richard wished to go, but had a difficulty in leaving abruptly. Darkness
      had fallen whilst they talked; they only saw each other by the light of
      the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I to come and see you or not, mother, when you get back to the old
      quarters?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t tell me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must come or stay away, as it suits you,&rsquo; she said, in a tone of
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, then I shall come, if it&rsquo;s only to tell you about &lsquo;Arry and
      Alice. And now will you let Alice come up and have some tea with you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell her she may,&rsquo; he said kindly, and went from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Alice in the drawing-room, and persuaded her to go up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just take it as if there &lsquo;d been nothing wrong,&rsquo; he said to his sister.
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s had a wretched time of it, I can see that. Take some tea-cakes up
      with you, and talk about going back to the Square as if she&rsquo;d proposed it
      herself. We mustn&rsquo;t be hard with her just because she can&rsquo;t change, poor
      old soul.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Socialistic business took him away during the evening. When he returned at
      eleven o&rsquo;clock, &lsquo;Arry had not yet come in. Shortly before one there were
      sounds of ineffectual effort at the front-door latch. Mutimer, who
      happened to be crossing the hall, heard them, and went to open the door.
      The result was that his brother fell forward at full length upon the mat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get up, drunken beast!&rsquo; Richard exclaimed angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beast yourself,&rsquo; was the hiccupped reply, repeated several times whilst
      &lsquo;Arry struggled to his feet. Then, propping himself against the door-post,
      the maligned youth assumed the attitude of pugilism, inviting all and
      sundry to come on and have their lights extinguished. Richard flung him
      into the hall and closed the door. &lsquo;Arry had again to struggle with
      gravitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Walk upstairs, if you can!&rsquo; ordered his brother with contemptuous
      severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      After much trouble &lsquo;Arry was got to his room, thrust in, and the door
      slammed behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard was not disposed to argue with his brother this time. He waited in
      the dining-room next morning till the champion of liberty presented
      himself; then, scarcely looking at him, said with quiet determination:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pack your clothes some time to-day. You&rsquo;re going to Wanley to-morrow
      morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not unless I choose,&rsquo; remarked &lsquo;Arry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You look here,&rsquo; exclaimed the elder, with concentrated savageness which
      did credit to his powers of command. What you choose has nothing to do
      with it, and that you&rsquo;ll please to understand. At half-past nine to-morrow
      morning you&rsquo;re ready for me in this room; hear that? I&rsquo;ll have an end to
      this kind of thing, or I&rsquo;ll know the reason why. Speak a word of impudence
      to me and I&rsquo;ll knock half your teeth out!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was capable of doing it. &lsquo;Arry got to his morning meal in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the morning Mr. Keene called. Mutimer received him in the
      dining-room, and they smoked together. Their talk was of the meetings to
      be held in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;ll be nasty doings up there,&rsquo; Keene remarked, indicating with his
      head the gathering place of Comrade Roodhouse&rsquo;s adherents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of what kind?&rsquo; Mutimer asked with indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s disagreeable talk going about. Probably they&rsquo;ll indulge in
      personalities a good deal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course they will,&rsquo; assented the other after a short pause. &lsquo;Westlake,
      eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not only Westlake. There&rsquo;s a more important man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer could not resist a smile, though he was uneasy. Keene understood
      the smile; it was always an encouragement to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have they got hold of?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;ll be references to the girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The girl?&rsquo; Richard hesitated. &lsquo;What girl? What do you know about any
      girl?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only the gossip I&rsquo;ve heard. I thought it would be as well if I went
      about among them last night just to pick up hints, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re talking about that, are they? Well, let them. It isn&rsquo;t hard to
      invent lies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just so,&rsquo; observed Mr. Keene sympathisingly. &lsquo;Of course I know they&rsquo;d
      twisted the affair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer glanced at him and smoked in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;d better be there to-night,&rsquo; the journalist continued. &lsquo;I shall
      be more useful there than at the hall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you like,&rsquo; said Mutimer lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject was not pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the occasion was of so much importance, Commonwealth Hall contained
      but a moderate audience when Mr. Westlake rose to deliver his address. The
      people who occupied the benches were obviously of a different stamp from
      those wont to assemble at the Hoxton meeting-place. There were perhaps a
      dozen artisans of intensely sober appearance, and the rest were men and
      women who certainly had never wrought with their hands. Near Mrs. Westlake
      sat several ladies, her personal friends. Of the men other than artisans
      the majority were young, and showed the countenance which bespeaks
      meritorious intelligence rather than ardour of heart or brain. Of
      enthusiasts in the true sense none could be discerned. It needed but a
      glance over this assembly to understand how very theoretical were the
      convictions that had brought its members together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Westlake&rsquo;s address was interesting, very interesting; he had prepared
      it with much care, and its literary qualities were admired when
      subsequently it saw the light in one of the leading periodicals. Now and
      then he touched eloquence; the sincerity animating him was unmistakable,
      and the ideal he glorified was worthy of a noble mind. Not in anger did he
      speak of the schism from which the movement was suffering; even his sorrow
      was dominated by a gospel of hope. Optimism of the most fervid kind glowed
      through his discourse; he grew almost lyrical in his anticipation of the
      good time coming. For to-night it seemed to him that encouragement should
      be the prevailing note; it was always easy to see the dark side of things.
      Their work, he told his hearers, was but just beginning. They aimed at
      nothing less than a revolution, and revolutions were not brought about in
      a day. None of them would in the flesh behold the reign of justice; was
      that a reason why they should neglect the highest impulses of their nature
      and sit contented in the shadow of the world&rsquo;s mourning? He spoke with
      passion of the millions disinherited before their birth, with infinite
      tenderness of those weak ones whom our social system condemns to a life of
      torture, just because they are weak. One loved the man for his great heart
      and for his gift of moving speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife sat, as she always did when listening intently, her body bent
      forward, one hand supporting her chin. Her eyes never quitted his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the second speaker it had fallen to handle in detail the differences of
      the hour. Mutimer&rsquo;s exordium was not inspiriting after the rich-rolling
      periods with which Mr. Westlake had come to an end; his hard voice
      contrasted painfully with the other&rsquo;s cultured tones. Richard was probably
      conscious of this, for he hesitated more than was his wont, seeking words
      which did not come naturally to him. However, he warmed to his work, and
      was soon giving his audience clearly to understand how he, Richard
      Mutimer, regarded the proceedings of Comrade Roodhouse. Let us be
      practical&mdash;this was the burden of his exhortation. We are Englishmen&mdash;and
      women&mdash;not flighty, frothy foreigners. Besides, we have the blessings
      of free speech, and with the tongue and pen we must be content to fight,
      other modes of warfare being barbarous. Those who in their inconsiderate
      zeal had severed the Socialist body, were taking upon themselves a very
      grave responsibility; not only had they troubled the movement internally,
      but they would doubtless succeed in giving it a bad name with many who
      were hitherto merely indifferent, and who might in time have been brought
      over. Let it be understood that in this hall the true doctrine was
      preached, and that the &lsquo;Fiery Cross&rsquo; was the true organ of English
      Socialism as distinguished from foreign crazes. The strength of England
      had ever been her sobriety; Englishmen did not fly at impossibilities like
      noisy children. He would not hesitate to say that the revolutionism
      preached in the newspaper called the &lsquo;Tocsin&rsquo; was dangerous, was immoral.
      And so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard was not at his best this evening. You might have seen Mrs.
      Westlake abandon her attentive position, and lean back rather wearily; you
      might have seen a covert smile on a few of the more intelligent faces. It
      was awkward for Mutimer to be praising moderation in a movement directed
      against capital, and this was not exactly the audience for eulogies of
      Great Britain at the expense of other countries. The applause when the
      orator seated himself was anything but hearty. Richard knew it, and
      inwardly cursed Mr. Westlake for taking the wind out of his sails.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very different was the scene in the meeting-room behind the coffee-shop.
      There, upon Comrade Roodhouse&rsquo;s harangue, followed a debate more stirring
      than any on the records of the Islington and Hoxton branch. The room was
      thoroughly full; the roof rang with tempestuous acclamations. Messrs.
      Cowes and Cullen were in their glory; they roared with delight at each
      depreciatory epithet applied to Mr. Westlake and his henchmen, and
      prompted the speakers with words and phrases of a rich vernacular. If
      anything, Comrade Roodhouse fell a little short of what was expected of
      him. His friends had come together prepared for gory language, but the
      murderous instigations of Clerkenwell Green were not repeated with the
      same crudity. The speaker dealt in negatives; not thus and thus was the
      social millennium to be brought about, it was open to his hearers to
      conceive the practical course. For the rest, the heresiarch had a mighty
      flow of vituperative speech. Aspirates troubled him, so that for the most
      part he cast them away, and the syntax of his periods was often
      anacoluthic; but these matters were of no moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Questions being called for, Mr. Cowes and Mr. Cullen of course started up
      simultaneously. The former gentleman got the ear of the meeting. With
      preliminary swaying of the hand, he looked round as one about to propound
      a question which would for ever establish his reputation for acumen. In
      his voice of quiet malice, with his frequent deliberate pauses, with the
      wonted emphasis on absurd pronunciations, he spoke somewhat thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the course of his address&mdash;I shall say nothin&rsquo; about its
      qualities, the time for discussion will come presently&mdash;our Comrade
      has said not a few &lsquo;ard things about certain individooals who put
      themselves forward as perractical Socialists&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not &lsquo;ard enough!&rsquo; roared a voice from the back of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cowes turned his lank figure deliberately, and gazed for a moment in
      the quarter whence the interruption had come. Then he resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I agree with that involuntary exclamation. Certainly, not &lsquo;ard enough.
      And the question I wish to put to our Comrade is this: Is he, or is he
      not, aweer of certain scandalous doin&rsquo;s on the part of one of these said
      individooals, I might say actions which, from the Socialist point of view,
      amount to crimes? If our Comrade is aweer of what I refer to, then it
      seems to me it was his dooty to distinctly mention it. If he was <i>not</i>
      aweer, then we in this neighbourhood shall be only too glad to enlighten
      him. I distinctly assert that a certain individooal we all have in our
      thoughts has proved himself a traitor to the cause of the people. Comrades
      will understand me. And that&rsquo;s the question I wish to put.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cowes had introduced the subject which a considerable number of those
      present were bent on publicly discussing. Who it was that had first spread
      the story of Mutimer&rsquo;s matrimonial concerns probably no one could have
      determined. It was not Daniel Dabbs, though Daniel, partly from genuine
      indignation, partly in consequence of slowly growing personal feeling
      against the Mutimers, had certainly supplied Richard&rsquo;s enemies with
      corroborative details. Under ordinary circumstances Mutimer&rsquo;s change of
      fortune would have seemed to his old mates a sufficient explanation of his
      behaviour to Emma Vine; they certainly would not have gone out of their
      way to condemn him. But Richard was by this time vastly unpopular with
      most of those who had once glorified him. Envy had had time to grow, and
      was assisted by Richard&rsquo;s avoidance of personal contact with his Hoxton
      friends. When they spoke of him now it was with sneers and sarcasms. Some
      one had confidently asserted that the so-called Socialistic enterprise at
      Wanley was a mere pretence, that Mutimer was making money just like any
      other capitalist, and the leaguers of Hoxton firmly believed this. They
      encouraged one another to positive hatred of the working man who had
      suddenly become wealthy; his name stank in their nostrils. This, in a
      great measure, explained Comrade Roodhouse&rsquo;s success; personal feeling is
      almost always the spring of public action among the uneducated. In the
      excitement of the schism a few of the more energetic spirits had
      determined to drag Richard&rsquo;s domestic concerns into publicity. They
      suddenly became aware that private morality was at the root of the general
      good; they urged each other to righteous indignation in a matter for which
      they did not really care two straws. Thus Mr. Cowes&rsquo;s question was
      received with vociferous approval. Those present who did not understand
      the allusion were quickly enlightened by their neighbours. A crowd of
      Englishmen working itself into a moral rage is as glorious a spectacle as
      the world can show. Not one of these men but heartily believed himself
      justified in reviling the traitor to his class, the betrayer of confiding
      innocence. Remember, too, how it facilitates speech to have a concrete
      topic on which to enlarge; in this matter a West End drawing-room and the
      Hoxton coffee-shop are akin. Regularity of procedure was at an end;
      question grew to debate, and debate was riot. Mr. Cullen succeeded Mr.
      Cowes and roared himself hoarse, defying the feeble protests of the
      chairman. He abandoned mere allusion, and rejoiced the meeting by
      declaring names. His example was followed by those who succeeded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little did Emma think, as she sat working, Sunday though it was, in her
      poor room, that her sorrows were being blared forth to a gross assembly in
      venomous accusation against the man who had wronged her. We can imagine
      that the knowledge would not greatly have soothed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comrade Roodhouse at length obtained a hearing. It was his policy to
      deprecate these extreme personalities, and in doing so he heaped on the
      enemy greater condemnation. There was not a little art in the heresiarch&rsquo;s
      modes of speech; the less obtuse appreciated him and bade him live for
      ever. The secretary of the branch busily took notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the meeting had broken up into groups, a number of the more prominent
      Socialists surrounded Comrade Roodhouse on the platform. Their talk was
      still of Mutimer, of his shameless hypocrisy, his greed, his infernal
      arrogance. Near at hand stood Mr. Keene; a word brought him into
      conversation with a neighbour. He began by repeating the prevalent abuse,
      then, perceiving that his hearer merely gave assent in general terms, he
      added:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder, though, if there was some reason we haven&rsquo;t heard of&mdash;I
      mean, about the girl, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think so?&rsquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I <i>have</i> heard it said&mdash;but then one doesn&rsquo;t care to
      repeat such things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that, eh?&rsquo; put in another man, who had caught the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, nothing. Only the girl&rsquo;s made herself scarce. Dare say the fault
      wasn&rsquo;t altogether on one side.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Keene winked meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hint spread among those on the platform. Daniel Dabbs happened to hear
      it repeated in a gross form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s been a-sayin&rsquo; that?&rsquo; he roared. &lsquo;Where have you got that from, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The source was already forgotten, but Daniel would not let the calumny
      take its way unopposed. He harangued those about him with furious
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If any man&rsquo;s got a word to say against Emma Vine, let him come an&rsquo; say it
      to me, that&rsquo;s all I Now look &lsquo;ere, all o&rsquo; you, I know that girl, and I
      know that anyone as talks like that about her tells a damned lie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most like it&rsquo;s Mutimer himself as has set it goin&rsquo;,&rsquo; observed someone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In five minutes all who remained in the room were convinced that Mutimer
      had sent an agent to the meeting for the purpose of assailing Emma Vine&rsquo;s
      good name. Mr. Keene had already taken his departure, and no suspicious
      character was discernible; a pity for the evening might have ended in a
      picturesque way.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Daniel Dabbs went home to his brother&rsquo;s public-house, obtained
      note-paper and an envelope, and forthwith indited a brief epistle which he
      addressed to the house in Highbury. It had no formal commencement, and
      ended with &lsquo;Yours, etc.&rsquo; Daniel demanded an assurance that his former
      friend had not instigated certain vile accusations against Emma, and
      informed him that whatever answer was received would be read aloud at next
      Sunday&rsquo;s meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one not wholly ignoble incident in that evening&rsquo;s transactions.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the partial reconciliation between Mrs. Mutimer and her children there
      was no tenderness on either side. The old conditions could not be
      restored, and the habits of the family did not lend themselves to the
      polite hypocrisy which lubricates the wheels of the refined world. There
      was to be a parting, and probably it would be for life. In Richard&rsquo;s
      household his mother could never have a part, and when Alice married,
      doubtless the same social difficulty would present itself. It was not the
      future to which Mrs. Mutimer had looked forward, but, having said her say,
      she resigned herself and hardened her heart. At least she would die in the
      familiar home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard had supper with his sister on his return from Commonwealth Hall,
      and their plans were discussed in further detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want you,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to go to the Square with mother to-morrow, and to
      stay there till Wednesday. You won&rsquo;t mind doing that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think she&rsquo;d do every bit as well without me,&rsquo; said Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind; I should like you to go. I&rsquo;ll take &lsquo;Arry down to-morrow
      morning, then I&rsquo;ll come and fetch you on Wednesday. You&rsquo;ll just see that
      everything&rsquo;s comfortable in the house, and buy her a few presents, the
      kind of things she&rsquo;d like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose she&rsquo;ll take anything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Try, at all events. And don&rsquo;t mind her talk; it does no harm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning came the letter from Daniel Dabbs. Richard read it without
      any feeling of surprise, still less with indignation, at the calumny of
      which it complained. During the night he had wondered uneasily what might
      have occurred at the Hoxton meeting, and the result was a revival of his
      ignoble anger against Emma. Had he not anxiety enough that she must bring
      him new trouble when he believed that all relations between him and her
      were at an end? Doubtless she was posing as a martyr before all who knew
      anything of her story; why had she refused his money, if not that her case
      might seem all the harder? It were difficult to say whether he really
      believed this; in a nature essentially egoistic, there is often no line to
      be drawn between genuine convictions and the irresponsible charges of
      resentment. Mutimer had so persistently trained himself to regard Emma as
      in the wrong, that it was no wonder if he had lost the power of judging
      sanely in any matter connected with her. Her refusal to benefit by his
      generosity had aggravated him; actually, no doubt, because she thus
      deprived him of a defence against his conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not surprised that libellous rumours were afloat, simply because
      since his yesterday&rsquo;s conversation with Keene the thought of justifying
      himself in some such way&mdash;should it really prove necessary&mdash;had
      several times occurred to him, suggested probably by Keene&rsquo;s own words.
      That the journalist had found means of doing him this service was very
      likely indeed. He remembered with satisfaction that no hint of such a
      thing had escaped his own lips. Still, he was uneasy. Keene might have
      fallen short of prudence, with the result that Daniel Dabbs might be in a
      position to trace this calumny to him, Mutimer. It would not be pleasant
      if the affair, thus represented, came to the ears of his friends,
      particularly of Mr. Westlake.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had just finished his breakfast, and was glancing over the newspaper in
      a dull and irritable mood, when Keene himself arrived. Mutimer expected
      him. Alice quitted the dining-room when he was announced, and &lsquo;Arry, who
      at the same moment came in for breakfast, was bidden go about his
      business, and be ready to leave the house in half-an-hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does this mean?&rsquo; Richard asked abruptly, handing the letter to his
      visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keene perused the crabbed writing, and uttered sundry &lsquo;Ah&rsquo;s&rsquo; and &lsquo;Hum&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know anything about it?&rsquo; Mutimer continued, in a tone between mere
      annoyance and serious indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I had better tell you what took place last night,&rsquo; said the
      journalist, with side glances. He had never altogether thrown off the
      deferential manner when conversing with his patron, and at present he
      emphasised it. &lsquo;Those fellows carry party feeling too far; the proceedings
      were scandalous. It really was enough to make one feel that one mustn&rsquo;t be
      too scrupulous in trying to stop their mouths. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, an
      action for defamation of character would lie against half-a-dozen of
      them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer was unfortunately deficient in sense of humour. He continued to
      scowl, and merely said: &lsquo;Go on; what happened?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keene allowed the evening&rsquo;s proceedings to lose nothing in his
      narration. He was successful in exciting his hearer to wrath, but, to his
      consternation, it was forthwith turned against himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you tried to make things better by going about telling what several
      of them would know perfectly well to be lies?&rsquo; exclaimed Mutimer,
      savagely. &lsquo;Who the devil gave you authority to do so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear sir,&rsquo; protested the journalist, &lsquo;you have quite mistaken me. I
      did not mean to admit that I had told lies. How could I for a moment
      suppose that a man of your character would sanction that kind of thing?
      Pooh, I hope I know you better! No, no; I merely in the course of
      conversation ventured to hint that, as you yourself had explained to me,
      there were reasons quite other than the vulgar mind would conceive for&mdash;for
      the course you had pursued. To my own apprehension such reasons are
      abundant, and, I will add, most conclusive. You have not endeavoured to
      explain them to me in detail; I trust you felt that I was not so dull of
      understanding as to be incapable of&mdash;of appreciating motives when
      sufficiently indicated. Situations of this kind are <i>never</i> to be
      explained grossly; I mean, of course, in the case of men of intellect. I
      flatter myself that I have come to know your ruling principles; and I will
      say that beyond a doubt your behaviour has been most honourable. Of course
      I was mistaken in trying to convey this to those I talked with last night;
      they misinterpreted me, and I might have expected it. We cannot give them
      the moral feelings which they lack. But I am glad that the error has so
      quickly come to light. A mere word from you, and such a delusion goes no
      farther. I regret it extremely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer held the letter in his hand, and kept looking from it to the
      speaker. Keene&rsquo;s subtleties were not very intelligible to him, but, even
      with a shrewd suspicion that he was being humbugged, he could not resist a
      sense of pleasure in hearing himself classed with the superior men whose
      actions are not to be explained by the vulgar. Nay, he asked himself
      whether the defence was not in fact a just one. After all, was it not
      possible that his conduct had been praiseworthy? He recovered the argument
      by which he had formerly tried to silence disagreeable inner voices; a man
      in his position owed it to society to effect a union of classes, and
      private feeling must give way before the higher motive. He reflected for a
      moment when Keene ceased to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did you say?&rsquo; he then asked, still bluntly, but with less anger.
      &lsquo;Just tell me the words, as far as you can remember.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Keene was at no loss to recall inoffensive phrases; in another long
      speech, full of cajolery sufficiently artful for the occasion, he
      represented himself as having merely protested against misrepresentations
      obviously sharpened by malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is just possible that I made some reference to her <i>character</i>,&rsquo; 
      he admitted, speaking more slowly, and as if desirous that no word should
      escape his hearer; &lsquo;but it did not occur to me to guard against
      misunderstandings of the word. I might have remembered that it has such
      different meanings on the lips of educated and of uneducated men. You, of
      course, would never have missed my thoughts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I might suggest,&rsquo; he added, when Mutimer kept silence, I think, if you
      condescend to notice the letter at all, you should reply only in the most
      general terms. Who is this man Dabbs, I wonder, who has the impudence to
      write to you in this way?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, one of the Hoxton Socialists, I suppose,&rsquo; Mutimer answered
      carelessly. &lsquo;I remember the name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A gross impertinence! By no means encourage them in thinking you owe
      explanations. Your position doesn&rsquo;t allow anything of the kind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said Richard, his ill-humour gone; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see to it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not able, after all, to catch the early train by which he had meant
      to take his brother to Wanley. He did not like to leave without some kind
      of good-bye to his mother, and Alice said that the old woman would not be
      ready to go before eleven o&rsquo;clock. After half an hour of restlessness he
      sat down to answer Daniel&rsquo;s letter. Keene&rsquo;s flattery had not been without
      its fruit. From anger which had in it an element of apprehension he passed
      to an arrogant self-confidence which character and circumstances were
      conspiring to make his habitual mood. It <i>was</i> a gross impertinence
      in Daniel to address him thus. What was the use of wealth if it did not
      exempt one from the petty laws binding on miserable hand to mouth toilers!
      He would have done with Emma Vine; his time was of too much value to the
      world to be consumed in wranglings about a work-girl. What if here and
      there someone believed the calumny? Would it do Emma any harm? That was
      most unlikely. On the whole, the misunderstanding was useful; let it take
      its course. Men with large aims cannot afford to be scrupulous in small
      details. Was not New Wanley a sufficient balance against a piece of
      injustice, which, after all, was only one of words?
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;DEAR SIR,&mdash;I have received your letter, but it is impossible for me
      to spend time in refuting idle stories. What&rsquo;s more, I cannot see that my
      private concerns are a fit subject for discussion at a public meeting, as
      I understand they have been made. You are at liberty to read this note
      when and where you please, and in that intention let me add that the cause
      of Socialism will not be advanced by attacks on the character of those
      most earnestly devoted to it. I remain, yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;RICHARD MUTIMER.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Richard that this was the very thing, alike in tone and
      phrasing. A week or two previously a certain statesman had written to the
      same effect in reply to calumnious statements, and Richard consciously
      made that letter his model. The statesman had probably been sounder in his
      syntax, but his imitator had, no doubt, the advantage in other points.
      Richard perused his composition several times, and sent it to the post.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven o&rsquo;clock Mrs. Mutimer descended to the hall, ready for her
      journey. She would not enter any room. Her eldest son came out to meet
      her, and got rid of the servant who had fetched a cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye for the present, mother,&rsquo; he said, giving his hand &lsquo;I hope
      you&rsquo;ll find everything just as you wish it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I don&rsquo;t, I shan&rsquo;t complain,&rsquo; was the cold reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman had clad herself, since her retreat, in the garments of
      former days; and the truth must be told that they did not add to the
      dignity of her appearance. Probably no costume devisable could surpass in
      ignoble ugliness the attire of an English working-class widow when she
      appears in the streets. The proximity of Alice, always becomingly clad,
      drew attention to the poor mother&rsquo;s plebeian guise. Richard, watching her
      enter the cab, felt for the first time a distinct shame. His feelings
      might have done him more credit but for the repulse he had suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arry contented himself with standing at the front-room window, his hands
      in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the same day Daniel Dabbs, who had by chance been following the
      British workman&rsquo;s practice and devoting Monday to recreation, entered an
      omnibus in which Mrs. Clay was riding. She had a heavy bundle on her lap,
      shopwork which she was taking home. Daniel had already received Mutimer&rsquo;s
      reply, and was nursing a fit of anger. He seated himself by Kate&rsquo;s side,
      and conversed with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heard anything from <i>him</i> lately?&rsquo; he asked, with a motion of the
      head which rendered mention of names unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not we,&rsquo; Kate replied bitterly, her eyes fixing themselves in scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No loss,&rsquo; remarked Daniel, with an expression of disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll hear from <i>me</i> some day,&rsquo; said the woman, &lsquo;and in a way as he
      won&rsquo;t like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise of the vehicle did not favour conversation. Daniel waited till
      Kate got out, then he too descended, and walked along by her side. He did
      not offer to relieve her of the bundle in primitive societies woman is
      naturally the burden-bearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t a&rsquo; thought it o&rsquo; Dick,&rsquo; he said, his head thrust forward, and
      his eyes turning doggedly from side to side. They say as how too much
      money ain&rsquo;t good for a man, but it&rsquo;s changed <i>him</i> past all knowin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He always had a good deal too much to say for himself,&rsquo; remarked Mrs.
      Clay, speaking with difficulty through her quickened breath, the bundle
      almost more than she could manage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish just now as he&rsquo;d say a bit more,&rsquo; said Daniel. &lsquo;Now, see, here&rsquo;s a
      letter I&rsquo;ve just got from him. I wrote to him last night to let him know
      of things as was goin&rsquo; round at the lecture. There&rsquo;s one or two of our
      men, you know, think he&rsquo;d ought to be made to smart a bit for the way he&rsquo;s
      treated Emma, and last night they up an&rsquo; spoke&mdash;you should just a&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;eard them. Then someone set it goin&rsquo; as the fault wasn&rsquo;t Dick&rsquo;s at all.
      See what I mean? I don&rsquo;t know who started that. I can&rsquo;t think as he&rsquo;d try
      to blacken a girl&rsquo;s name just to excuse himself; that&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; a bit too
      far.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clay came to a standstill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s been saying things of Emma?&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;Is that what you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, see now. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t rightly believe it yet.
      I&rsquo;ll read you the answer as he&rsquo;s sent me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel gave forth the letter, getting rather lost amid its pretentious
      periods, with the eccentric pauses and intonation of an uneducated reader.
      Standing in a busy thoroughfare, he and Kate almost blocked the pavement;
      impatient pedestrians pushed against them, and uttered maledictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s Dick&rsquo;s new way o&rsquo; sayin&rsquo; he hadn&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to do with
      it,&rsquo; Daniel commented at the end. &lsquo;Money seems always to bring long words
      with it somehow. It seems to me he&rsquo;d ought to speak plainer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s done it, if he didn&rsquo;t?&rsquo; Kate exclaimed, with shrill anger. &lsquo;You
      don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s another man &lsquo;ud go about telling coward lies? The
      mean wretch! Says things about my sister, does he? I&rsquo;ll be even with that
      man yet, never you mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t believe it o&rsquo; Dick,&rsquo; muttered Dabbs. &lsquo;He says &lsquo;ere, you
      see, as he hasn&rsquo;t time to contradict &ldquo;idle stories.&rdquo; I suppose that means
      he didn&rsquo;t start &lsquo;em.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he tells one lie, won&rsquo;t he tell another?&rsquo; cried the woman. She was
      obliged to put down her bundle on a doorstep, and used the moment of
      relief to pour forth vigorous vituperation. Dick listened with an air half
      of approval, half doggedly doubtful. He was not altogether satisfied with
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I must get off &lsquo;ome,&rsquo; he said at length. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only right as you
      should know what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on. There&rsquo;s no one believes a word of it, and
      that you can tell Emma. If I hear it repeated, you may be sure I&rsquo;ll up an&rsquo; 
      say what I think. It won&rsquo;t go no further if I can stop it. Well, so long!
      Give my respects to your sister.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel waved his arm and made off across the street. Kate, clutching her
      bundle again, panted along by-ways; reaching the house-door she rang a
      bell twice, and Emma admitted her. They climbed together to an upper room,
      where Kate flung her burden on to the floor and began at once to relate
      with vehemence all that Daniel had told her. The calumny lost nothing in
      her repetition. After listening in surprise for a few moments, Emma turned
      away and quietly began to cut bread and butter for the children, who were
      having their tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got anything to say?&rsquo; cried her sister. &lsquo;I suppose he&rsquo;ll be
      telling his foul lies about me next. Oh, he&rsquo;s a good-&rsquo;earted man, is
      Mutimer! Perhaps you&rsquo;ll believe me now. Are you going to let him talk what
      he likes about you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the abandonment of the house in Wilton Square, Kate had incessantly
      railed in this way; it was a joy to her to have discovered new matter for
      invective. Emma&rsquo;s persistent silence maddened her; even now not a word was
      to be got from the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you speak?&rsquo; shrilled Mrs. Clay. &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t do something, I let
      you know that I shall! I&rsquo;m not going to stand this kind o&rsquo; thing, don&rsquo;t
      think it. If they talk ill of you they&rsquo;ll do the same of me. It&rsquo;s time
      that devil had something for himself. You might be made o&rsquo; stone! I only
      hope I may meet him in the streets, that&rsquo;s all! I&rsquo;ll show him up, see if I
      don&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;ll let all the people know what he is, the cur! I&rsquo;ll do something
      to make him give me in charge, and then I&rsquo;ll tell it all out before the
      magistrates. I don&rsquo;t care what comes, I&rsquo;ll find some way of paying out
      that beast!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma turned angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold your tongue, Kate! If you go on like this day after day we shall
      have to part; I can&rsquo;t put up with it, so there now! I&rsquo;ve begged and prayed
      you to stop, and you don&rsquo;t pay the least heed to me; I think you might
      have more kindness. You&rsquo;ll never make me say a single word about him, do
      what you will; I&rsquo;ve told you that many a time, and I mean what I say. Let
      him say what he likes and do what he likes. It&rsquo;s nothing to me, and it
      doesn&rsquo;t concern you. You&rsquo;ll drive me out of the house again, like you did
      the other night. I can&rsquo;t bear it. Do you understand, Kate?&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
      bear it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice shook, and there were tears of uttermost shame and misery in her
      eyes. The children sitting at the table, though accustomed to scenes of
      this kind, looked at the disputants with troubled faces, and at length the
      younger began to cry. Emma at once turned to the little one with smiles of
      re-assurance. Kate would have preferred to deal slaps, but contented
      herself with taking a cup of tea to the fireside, and sulking for half an
      hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma unrolled the bundle of work, and soon the hum of the sewing-machine
      began, to continue late into the night.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      You remember that one side of the valley in which stood New Wanley was
      clad with trees. Through this wood a public path made transverse ascent to
      the shoulder of the bill, a way little used save by Wanley ramblers in
      summer time. The section of the wood above the path was closed against
      trespassers; among the copses below anyone might freely wander. In places
      it was scarcely possible to make a way for fern, bramble, and underwood,
      but elsewhere mossy tracks led one among hazels or under arches of foliage
      which made of the mid-day sky a cool, golden shimmer. One such track,
      abruptly turning round a great rock over the face of which drooped the
      boughs of an ash, came upon a little sloping lawn, which started from a
      high hazel-covered bank. The bank itself was so shaped as to afford an
      easy seat, shaded even when the grass in front was all sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela had long known this retreat, and had been accustomed to sit here
      with Letty, especially when she needed to exchange deep confidences with
      her friend. Once, just as they were settling themselves upon the bank,
      they were startled by a movement among the leaves above, followed by the
      voice of someone addressing them with cheerful friendliness, and making
      request to be allowed to descend and join them. It was Hubert Eldon, just
      home for the long vacation. Once or twice subsequently the girls had met
      Hubert on the same spot; there had been a picnic here, too, in which Mrs.
      Eldon and Mrs. Waltham took part. But Adela always thought of the place as
      peculiarly her own. To others it was only a delightfully secluded corner
      of the wood, fresh and green; for her it had something intimately dear, as
      the haunt where she had first met her own self face to face and had heard
      the whispering of secrets as if by another voice to her tremulous heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat here one morning in July, six months after her marriage. It was
      more than a year since she had seen the spot, and on reaching it to-day it
      seemed to her less beautiful than formerly; the leafage was to her eyes
      thinner and less warm of hue than in earlier years, the grass had a
      coarser look and did not clothe the soil so completely. An impulse had
      brought her hither, and her first sense on arriving had been one of
      disappointment. Was the change in her way of seeing? or had the retreat
      indeed suffered, perchance from the smoke of New Wanley? The
      disappointment was like that we experience in revisiting a place kept only
      in memory since childhood. Adela had not travelled much in the past year,
      but her growth in experience had put great tracts between her and the days
      when she came here to listen and wonder. It was indeed a memory of her
      childhood that led her into the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had brought with her a German book on Socialism and a little German
      dictionary. At the advice of Mr. Westlake, given some months ago on the
      occasion of a visit to the Manor, she had applied herself diligently to
      this study. But it was not only with a view to using the time that she had
      selected these books this morning. In visiting a scene which would
      strongly revive the past, instinct&mdash;rather than conscious purpose&mdash;had
      bidden her keep firm hold upon the present. On experiencing her
      disillusion a sense of trouble had almost led her to retrace her steps at
      once, but she overcame this, and, seating herself on the familiar bank,
      began to toil through hard sentences. Such moments of self-discipline were
      of daily occurrence in her life; she kept watch and ward over her feelings
      and found in efforts of the mind a short way out of inner conflicts which
      she durst not suffer to pass beyond the first stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near at hand there grew a silver birch Hubert Eldon, on one of the
      occasions when he talked here with Adela and Letty, had by chance let his
      eyes wander from Adela to the birch tree, and his fancy, just then active
      among tender images, suggested a likeness between that graceful, gleaming
      stem with its delicately drooping foliage and the sweet-featured girl who
      stood before him with her head bowed in unconscious loveliness. As the
      silver birch among the trees of the wood, so was Adela among the men and
      women of the world. And to one looking upon her by chance such a
      comparison might still have occurred. But in face she was no longer what
      she had then been. Her eyebrows, formerly so smooth and smiling, now
      constantly drew themselves together as if at a thought of pain or in some
      mental exertion. Her cheeks had none of their maiden colour. Her lips were
      closed too firmly, and sometimes trembled like those of old persons who
      have known much trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of herself her attention flagged from the hard, dull book; the
      spirit of the place was too strong for her, and, as in summers gone by,
      she was lost in vision. But not with eyes like these had she been wont to
      dream on the green branches or on the sward that lay deep in sunlight. On
      her raised lids sat the heaviness of mourning; she seemed to strain her
      sight to something very far off, something which withdrew itself from her
      desire, upon which her soul called and called in vain. Her cheeks showed
      their thinness, her brow foretold the lines which would mark it when she
      grew old. It was a sob in her throat which called her back to
      consciousness, a sob which her lips, well-trained warders, would not allow
      to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      She forced herself to the book again, and for some minutes plied her
      dictionary with feverish zeal. Then there came over her countenance a
      strange gleam of joy, as if she triumphed in self-conquest. She smiled as
      she continued her work, clearly making a happiness of each mastered
      sentence. And, looking up with the smile still fixed, she found that her
      solitude was invaded. Letty Tew had just appeared round the rock which
      sheltered the green haven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You here, Adela?&rsquo; the girl exclaimed. &lsquo;How strange!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why strange, Letty?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, only because I had a sort of feeling that perhaps I might meet you.
      Not here, particularly,&rsquo; she added, as if eager to explain herself, &lsquo;but
      somewhere in the wood. The day is so fine; it tempts one to walk about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty did not approach her friend as she would have done when formerly
      they met here. Her manner was constrained, almost timid; it seemed an
      afterthought when she bent forward for the kiss. Since Adela&rsquo;s marriage
      the intercourse between them had been comparatively slight. For the first
      three months they had seen each other only at long intervals, in part
      owing to circumstances. After the fortnight she spent in London at the
      time of her marriage, Adela had returned to Wanley in far from her usual
      state of health; during the first days of February there had been a fear
      that she might fall gravely ill. Only in advanced spring had she begun to
      go beyond the grounds of the Manor, and it was still unusual for her to do
      so except in her carriage. Letty had acquiesced in the altered relations;
      she suffered, and for various reasons, but did not endeavour to revive an
      intimacy which Adela seemed no longer to desire. Visits to the Manor were
      from the first distressing to her; the natural subjects of conversation
      were those which both avoided, and to talk in the manner of mere
      acquaintances was scarcely possible. Of course this state of things led to
      remark. Mrs. Waltham was inclined to suspect some wrong feeling on Letty&rsquo;s
      side, though of what nature it was hard to determine. Alfred, on the other
      hand, took his sister&rsquo;s behaviour ill, more especially as he felt a
      distinct change in her manner to himself. Was the girl going to be spoilt
      by the possession of wealth? What on earth did she mean by her reserve,
      her cold dignity? Wasn&rsquo;t Letty good enough for her now that she was lady
      of the Manor? Letty herself, when the subject was spoken of, pretended to
      recognise no change beyond what was to be expected. So far from being
      hurt, her love for Adela grew warmer during these months of seeming
      estrangement; her only trouble was that she could not go often and sit by
      her friend&rsquo;s side&mdash;sit silently, hand holding hand. That would have
      been better than speech, which misled, or at best was inadequate. Meantime
      she supported herself with the hope that love might some day again render
      her worthy of Adela&rsquo;s confidence. That her friend was far above her she
      had always gladly confessed; she felt it more than ever now that she tried
      in vain to read Adela&rsquo;s secret thoughts. The marriage was a mystery to
      her; to the last moment she had prayed that something might prevent it.
      Yet, now that Adela was Mrs. Mutimer, she conscientiously put away every
      thought of discontent, and only wondered what high motive had dictated the
      choice and&mdash;for such she knew it must be&mdash;the sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you reading?&rsquo; Letty asked, sitting down on the bank at a little
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s hardly to be called reading. I have to look out every other word.
      It&rsquo;s a book by a man called Schaeffle, on the &ldquo;Social Question.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes,&rsquo; said the girl, hazarding a conjecture that the work had
      something to do with Socialism. &lsquo;Of course that interests you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to write a translation of it. My husband doesn&rsquo;t read
      German, and this book is important.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose you are quite a Socialist, Adela?&rsquo; Letty inquired, in a tone
      which seemed anxious to presuppose the affirmative answer. She had never
      yet ventured to touch on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I am a Socialist,&rsquo; said Adela firmly. &lsquo;I am sure anyone will be who
      thinks about it, and really understands the need for Socialism. Does the
      word still sound a little dreadful to you? I remember so well when it did
      to me. It was only because I knew nothing about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I have that excuse,&rsquo; said the other. &lsquo;Alfred is constantly
      explaining. But, Adela&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused, not quite daring to speak her thoughts. Adela smiled an
      encouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was going to say&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t be offended. But you still go
      to church?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, I go to church. You mustn&rsquo;t think that everything Alfred insists
      upon belongs to Socialism. I believe that all Christians ought to be
      Socialists; I think it is part of our religion, if only we carry it out
      faithfully.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But does Mr. Wyvern think so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he does; he does indeed. I talk with Mr. Wyvern frequently, and I
      never knew, before he showed me, how necessary it is for a Christian to be
      a Socialist.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You surprise me, Adela. Yet he doesn&rsquo;t confess himself a Socialist.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, he does. When did you hear Mr. Wyvern preach a sermon without
      insisting on justice and unselfishness and love of our neighbour? If we
      try to be just and unselfish, and to love our neighbour as ourself, we
      help the cause of Socialism. Mr. Wyvern doesn&rsquo;t deal with politics&mdash;it
      is not necessary he should. That is for men like my husband, who give
      their lives to the practical work. Mr. Wyvern confines himself to
      spiritual teaching. He would injure his usefulness if he went beyond
      that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty was awed by the exceeding change which showed itself not only in
      Adela&rsquo;s ways of thought, but in her very voice and manner of speaking. The
      tone was so authoritative, so free from the diffidence which had formerly
      kept Adela from asserting strongly even her cherished faiths. She felt,
      too, that with the maiden hesitancy something else had gone, at all events
      in a great degree; something that it troubled her to miss; namely, that
      winning persuasiveness which had been one of the characteristics that made
      Adela so entirely lovable. At present Mrs. Mutimer scarcely sought to
      persuade; she uttered her beliefs as indubitable. A competent observer
      might now and then have surmised that she felt it needful to remind
      herself of the creed she had accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were smiling when I first caught sight of you,&rsquo; Letty said, after
      reflecting for a moment. &lsquo;Was it something in the book?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela again smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, something in myself,&rsquo; she replied with an air of confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because you are happy, Adela?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, because I am happy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How glad I am to hear that, dear!&rsquo; Letty exclaimed, for the first time
      allowing herself to use the affectionate word. &lsquo;You will let me be glad
      with you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hands stole a little forward, but Adela did not notice it; for she was
      gazing straight before her, with an agitated look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I am very happy, I have found something to do in life. I was afraid
      at first that I shouldn&rsquo;t be able to give my husband any help in his work;
      I seemed useless. But I am learning, and I hope soon to be of real use, if
      only in little things. You know that I have begun to give a tea to the
      children every Wednesday? They&rsquo;re not in need of food and comforts, I&rsquo;m
      glad to say; nobody wants in New Wanley; but it&rsquo;s nice to bring them
      together at the Manor, and teach them to behave gently to each other, and
      to sit properly at table, and things like that. Will you come and see them
      to-day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be very pleased.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-day I&rsquo;m going to begin something new. After tea we shall have a
      reading. Mr. Wyvern sent me a book this morning&mdash;&ldquo;Andersen&rsquo;s Fairy
      Tales.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve read them. Yes, that&rsquo;ll do nicely. Read them &ldquo;The Ugly
      Duckling,&rdquo; Adela; it&rsquo;s a beautiful story. I thought perhaps you were going
      to read something&mdash;something instructive, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela laughed. It was Adela&rsquo;s laugh still, but not what it used to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I want to amuse them. They get enough instruction in school. I hope
      soon to give another evening to the older girls. I wonder whether you
      would like to come and help me then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If only you would let me! There is nothing I should like more than to do
      something for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you mustn&rsquo;t do it for me. It must be for the girls&rsquo; sake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, for theirs as well, but ever so much more for yours, dear. You can&rsquo;t
      think how glad I am that you have asked me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the little hand was put forward, and this time Adela took it. But
      she did not soften as she once would have done. With eyes still far away,
      she talked for some minutes of the hopes with which her life was filled.
      Frequently she made mention of her husband, and always as one to whom it
      was a privilege to devote herself. Her voice had little failings and
      uncertainties now and then, but this appeared to come of excessive
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rose and walked from the wood together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alfred wants us to go to Malvern for a fortnight,&rsquo; Letty said, when they
      were near the gates of the Manor. &lsquo;We were wondering whether you could
      come, Adela?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I can&rsquo;t leave Wanley,&rsquo; was the reply. &lsquo;My husband&rsquo;&mdash;she never
      referred to Mutimer otherwise than by this name&mdash;&lsquo;spoke of the
      seaside the other day, but we decided not to go away at all. There is so
      much to be done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When Adela went to the drawing-room just before luncheon, she found Alice
      Mutimer engaged with a novel. Reading novels had become an absorbing
      occupation with Alice. She took them to bed with her so as to read late,
      and lay late in the morning for the same reason. She must have been one of
      Mr. Mudie&rsquo;s most diligent subscribers. She had no taste for walking in the
      country, and could only occasionally be persuaded to take a drive. It was
      not surprising that her face had not quite the healthy colour of a year
      ago; there was negligence, too, in her dress, and she had grown addicted
      to recumbent attitudes. Between her and Adela no semblance of friendship
      had yet arisen, though the latter frequently sought to substitute a nearer
      relation for superficial friendliness. Alice never exhibited anything
      short of good-will, but her first impressions were lasting; she suspected
      her sister-in-law of a desire to patronise, and was determined to allow
      nothing of the kind. With a more decided character, Alice&rsquo;s prepossessions
      would certainly have made life at the Manor anything but smooth; as it
      was, nothing ever occurred to make unpleasantness worth her while.
      Besides, when not buried in her novels, she gave herself up to
      absentmindedness; Adela found conversation with her almost impossible, for
      Alice would answer a remark with a smiling &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;No,&rsquo; and at once go
      off into dreamland, so that one hesitated to disturb her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What time is it?&rsquo; she inquired, when she became aware of Adela moving
      about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All but half-past one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really? I suppose I must go and get ready for lunch. What a pity we can&rsquo;t
      do without meals!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You should go out in the morning and get an appetite. Really, you are
      getting very pale, Alice. I&rsquo;m sure you read far too much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela had it on her lips to say &lsquo;too many novels,&rsquo; but was afraid to
      administer a direct rebuke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I like reading, and I don&rsquo;t care a bit for going out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What about your practising?&rsquo; Adela asked, with a playful shake of the
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I know it&rsquo;s very neglectful, but really it is such awful work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And your French?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make a beginning to-morrow. At least, I think I will. I don&rsquo;t
      neglect things wilfully, but it&rsquo;s so awfully hard to really get at it when
      the time comes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The luncheon-bell rang, and Alice, with a cry of dismay, sped to her room.
      She knew that her brother was to lunch at home to-day, and Richard was
      terrible in the matter of punctuality.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Soon as the meal was over Alice hastened back to her low chair in the
      drawing-room. Richard and his wife went together into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think Rodman&rsquo;s been advising me this morning?&rsquo; Mutimer said,
      speaking with a cigar in his mouth. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a queer idea; I don&rsquo;t quite know
      what to think of it. You know there&rsquo;ll be a general election some time
      next year, and he advises me to stand for Belwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not look at his wife. Coming to a garden-seat, he put up one foot
      upon it, and brushed the cigar ash against the back. Adela sat down; she
      had not replied at once, and was thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As a Socialist candidate?&rsquo; she asked, when at length he turned his eyes
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. Radical rather, I should think. It would come to the
      same thing, of course, and there&rsquo;d be no use in spoiling the thing for the
      sake of a name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela had a Japanese fan in her hand; she put it against her forehead, and
      still seemed to consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think you could find time for Parliament?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That has to be thought of, of course; but by then I should think we might
      arrange it. There&rsquo;s not much that Rodman can&rsquo;t see to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are inclined to think of it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela&rsquo;s tone to her husband was not one of tenderness, but of studious
      regard and deference. She very seldom turned her eyes to his, but there
      was humility in her bent look. If ever he and she began to speak at the
      same time, she checked herself instantly, and Mutimer had no thought of
      giving her precedence. This behaviour in his wife struck him as altogether
      becoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I almost think I am,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a notion I could give them an
      idea or two at Westminster. It would be news to them to hear a man say
      what he really thinks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela smiled faintly, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you like me to be in Parliament?&rsquo; Richard asked, putting down his
      foot and leaning back his head a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, if you feel that it is a step gained.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s just what I think it would be. Well, we must talk about it again.
      By-the-by, I&rsquo;ve just had to send a fellow about his business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To discharge a man?&rsquo; Adela asked, with pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s that man Rendal; I was talking about him the other day, you
      remember. He&rsquo;s been getting drunk; I&rsquo;ll warrant it&rsquo;s not the first time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you really must send him away? Couldn&rsquo;t you give him another chance?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. He was impudent to me, and I can&rsquo;t allow that. He&rsquo;ll have to go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard spoke with decision. When the fact of impudence was disclosed
      Adela felt that it was useless to plead. She looked at her fan and was
      sorrowful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you are going to read to the youngsters to-day?&rsquo; Mutimer recommenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; Mr. Wyvern has given me a book that will do very well indeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, has he?&rsquo; said Richard doubtfully. &lsquo;Is it a religious book? That kind
      of thing won&rsquo;t do, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t religious at all. Only a book of fairy tales.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fairy tales!&rsquo; There was scorn in his way of repeating the words.
      &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you find something useful? A history book, you know, or about
      animals, or something of that kind. We mustn&rsquo;t encourage them in idle
      reading. And that reminds me of Alice. You really must get her away from
      those novels. I can&rsquo;t make out what&rsquo;s come to the girl. She seems to be
      going off her head. Did you notice at lunch?&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t seem to
      understand what I said to her. Do try and persuade her to practise, if
      nothing else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid to do more than just advise in a pleasant way,&rsquo; said Adela.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I shall lose my temper with her before long.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is Harry doing? &lsquo;Adela asked, to pass over the difficult subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s an idle scamp! If some one &lsquo;ud give him a good thrashing, that&rsquo;s
      what <i>he</i> wants.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I ask him to dinner to-morrow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can if you like, of course,&rsquo; Richard replied with hesitation. &lsquo;I
      shouldn&rsquo;t have thought you cared much about having him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I am always very glad to have him. I have meant to ask you to let him
      dine with us oftener. I am so afraid he should think we neglect him, and
      that would be sure to have a bad effect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer looked at her with satisfaction, and assented to her reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But about the fairy tales,&rsquo; Adela said presently, when Richard had
      finished his cigar and was about to return to the works. &lsquo;Do you seriously
      object to them? Of course I could find another book.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do <i>you</i> think? I am rather surprised that Wyvern suggested
      reading of that kind; he generally has good ideas.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fancy he wished to give the children a better kind of amusement,&rsquo; said
      Adela, with hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A better kind, eh? Well, do as you like. I dare say it&rsquo;s no great harm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if you really&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; read the tales. I dare say they wouldn&rsquo;t listen to a better
      book.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not very encouraging, but Adela ventured to abide by the vicar&rsquo;s
      choice. She went to her own sitting-room and sought the story that Letty
      had spoken of. From &lsquo;The Ugly Duckling&rsquo; she was led on to the story of the
      mermaid, from that to the enchanted swans. The book had never been in her
      hands before, and the delight she received from it was of a kind quite new
      to her. She had to make an effort to close it and turn to her specified
      occupations. For Adela had so systematised her day that no minute&rsquo;s margin
      was left for self-indulgence. Her reading was serious study. If ever she
      was tempted to throw open one of the volumes which Alice left about, a
      glance at the pages was enough to make her push it away as if it were
      impure. She had read very few stories of any kind, and of late had felt a
      strong inclination towards such literature; the spectacle of Alice&rsquo;s
      day-long absorption was enough to excite her curiosity, even if there had
      not existed other reasons. But these longings for a world of romance she
      crushed down as unworthy of a woman to whom life had revealed its dread
      significances: and, though she but conjectured the matter and tone of the
      fiction Alice delighted in, instinctive fear would alone have restrained
      her from it. For pleasure in the ordinary sense she did not admit into her
      scheme of existence; the season for that had gone by. Henceforth she must
      think, and work, and pray. Therefore she had set herself gladly to learn
      German; it was a definite task to which such and such hours could be
      devoted, and the labour would strengthen her mini Her ignorance she
      represented as a great marsh which by toil had to be filled up and
      converted into solid ground. She had gone through the library catalogue
      and made a list of books which seemed needful to be read; and Mr. Wyvern
      had been of service in guiding her, as well as in lending volumes from his
      own shelves. The vicar, indeed, had surprised her by the zealous kindness
      with which he entered into all her plans; at first she had talked to him
      with apprehension, remembering that chance alone had prevented her from
      appealing to him to save her from this marriage. But Mr. Wyvern, with
      whose philosophy we have some acquaintance, exerted himself to make the
      best of the irremediable, and Adela already owed him much for his
      unobtrusive moral support. Even Mutimer was putting aside his suspicions
      and beginning to believe that the clergyman would have openly encouraged
      Socialism had his position allowed him to do so. He was glad to see his
      wife immersed in grave historical and scientific reading; he said to
      himself that in this way she would be delivered from her religious
      prejudices, and some day attain to &lsquo;free thought.&rsquo; Adela as yet had no
      such end in view, but already she understood that her education, in the
      serious sense, was only now beginning. As a girl, her fate had been that
      of girls in general; when she could write without orthographical errors,
      and could play by rote a few pieces of pianoforte music, her education had
      been pronounced completed. In the profound moral revolution which her
      nature had recently undergone her intellect also shared; when the first
      numbing shock had spent itself, she felt the growth of an intellectual
      appetite formerly unknown. Resolutely setting herself to exalt her
      husband, she magnified his acquirements, and, as a duty, directed her mind
      to the things he deemed of importance. One of her impulses took the form
      of a hope which would have vastly amused Richard had he divined it. Adela
      secretly trusted that some day her knowledge might be sufficient to allow
      her to cope with her husband&rsquo;s religious scepticism. It was significant
      that she could face in this way the great difficulty of her life; the
      stage at which it seemed sufficient to iterate creeds was already behind
      her. Probably Mr. Wyvern&rsquo; 5 conversation was not without its effect in
      aiding her to these larger views, but she never spoke to him on the
      subject directly. Her native dignity developed itself with her womanhood,
      and one of the characteristics of the new Adela was a reserve which at
      times seemed to indicate coldness or even spiritual pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather made it possible to spread the children&rsquo;s tea in the open air.
      At four o&rsquo;clock Letty came, and was quietly happy in being allowed to
      superintend one of the tables. Adela was already on affectionate terms
      with many of the little ones, though others regarded her with awe rather
      than warmth of confidence. This was strange, when we remember how
      childlike she had formerly been with children. But herein, too, there was
      a change; she could not now have caught up Letty&rsquo;s little sister and
      trotted with her about the garden as she was used to do. She could no
      longer smile in the old simple, endearing way; it took some time before a
      child got accustomed to her eyes and lips. Her movements, though graceful
      as ever, were subdued to matronly gravity; never again would Adela turn
      and run down the hill, as after that meeting with Hubert Eldon. But her
      sweetness was in the end irresistible to all who came within the circle of
      its magic. You saw its influence in Letty, whose eyes seemed never at rest
      save when they were watching Adela, who sprang to her side with delight if
      the faintest sign did but summon her. You saw its influence, moreover,
      when, the tea over, the children ranged themselves on the lawn to hear her
      read. After the first few sentences, everywhere was profoundest attention;
      the music of her sweetly modulated voice, the art which she learnt only
      from nature, so allied themselves with the beauty of the pages she read
      that from beginning to end not a movement interrupted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst she was reading a visitor presented himself at the Manor, and asked
      if Mrs. Mutimer was at home. The servant explained how and where Mrs.
      Mutimer was engaged, for the party was held in a quarter of the garden
      hidden from the approach to the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Miss Mutimer within?&rsquo; was the visitor&rsquo;s next inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Receiving an affirmative reply, he begged that Miss Mutimer might be
      informed of Mr. Keene&rsquo;s desire to see her. And Mr. Keene was led to the
      drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice was reposing on a couch; she did not trouble herself to rise when
      the visitor entered, but held a hand to him, at the same time scarcely
      suppressing a yawn. Novel reading has a tendency to produce this
      expression of weariness. Then she smiled, as one does in greeting an old
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who ever would have expected to see you!&rsquo; she began, drawing away her
      hand when it seemed to her that Mr. Keene had detained it quite long
      enough. &lsquo;Does Dick expect you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your brother does not expect me, Miss Mutimer,&rsquo; Keene replied. He
      invariably began conversation with her in a severely formal and respectful
      tone, and to-day there was melancholy in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve just come on your own&mdash;because you thought you would?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have come because I could not help it, Miss Mutimer. It is more than a
      month since I had the happiness of seeing you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood by the couch, his body bent in deference, his eyes regarding her
      with melancholy homage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Mutimer has a tea-party of children from New Wanley,&rsquo; said Alice
      with a provoking smile. &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you go and join them? She&rsquo;s reading to
      them, I believe; no doubt it&rsquo;s something that would do you good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I will go if you send me. I would go anywhere at your command.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then please do. Turn to the right when you get out into the garden.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Keene stood for an instant with his eyes on the ground, then sighed deeply&mdash;groaned,
      in fact&mdash;smote his breast, and marched towards the door like a
      soldier at drill. As soon as he had turned his back Alice gathered herself
      from the couch, and, as soon as she stood upright, called to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Keene!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He halted and faced round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t go unless you like, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He almost ran towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just ring the bell, will you? I want some tea, and I&rsquo;ll give you a cup if
      you care for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a seat, and indicated with a finger the place where he might
      repose. It was at a three yards&rsquo; distance. Then they talked as they were
      wont to, with much coquetry on Alice&rsquo;s side, and on Keene&rsquo;s always humble
      submissiveness tempered with glances and sighs. They drank tea, and Keene
      used the opportunity of putting down his cup to take a nearer seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Mutimer&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there any hope for me? You remember you said I was to wait a month,
      and I&rsquo;ve waited longer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, you have been very good,&rsquo; said Alice, smiling loftily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there any hope for me?&rsquo; he repeated, with an air of encouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Less than ever,&rsquo; was the girl&rsquo;s reply, lightly given, indeed, but not to
      be mistaken for a jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean that? Come, now, you don&rsquo;t really mean that? There must be, at
      all events, as much hope as before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There isn&rsquo;t. There never was so little hope. There&rsquo;s no hope at all, <i>not
      a scrap</i>!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She pressed her lips and looked at him with a grave face. He too became
      grave, and in a changed way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not to take this seriously?&rsquo; he asked with bated breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are. There&rsquo;s not one scrap of hope, and it&rsquo;s better you should know
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then&mdash;there&mdash;there must be somebody else?&rsquo; he groaned, his
      distress no longer humorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice continued to look him in the face for a moment, and at length nodded
      twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There <i>is</i> somebody else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded three times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go. Good-bye, Miss Mutimer. Yes, I&rsquo;ll go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not offer to shake hands, but bowed and moved away dejectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you&rsquo;re not going back to London?&rsquo; Alice asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better not do that. They&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;ve called. You&rsquo;d far better
      stay and see Dick; don&rsquo;t you think so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head and still moved towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Keene!&rsquo; Alice raised her voice. &lsquo;Please do as I tell you. It isn&rsquo;t my
      fault, and I don&rsquo;t see why you should pay no heed to me all at once. Will
      you attend to me, Mr. Keene?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you wish me to do?&rsquo; he asked, only half turning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To go and see Mrs. Mutimer in the garden, and accept her invitation to
      dinner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t got a dress-suit,&rsquo; he groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No matter. If you go away I&rsquo;ll never speak to you again, and you know you
      wouldn&rsquo;t like that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at her miserably&mdash;his face was one which lent itself to a
      miserable expression, and the venerable appearance of his frockcoat and
      light trousers filled in the picture of mishap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you been joking with me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ve been telling you the truth. But that&rsquo;s no reason why you should
      break loose all at once. Please do as I tell you; go to the garden now and
      stop to dinner. I am not accustomed to ask a thing twice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was almost serious. Keene smiled in a sickly way, bowed, and went to
      do her bidding.

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Among the little girls who had received invitations to the tea-party were
      two named Rendal, the children of the man whose dismissal from New Wanley
      had been announced by Mutimer. Adela was rather surprised to see them in
      the garden. They were eight and nine years old respectively, and she
      noticed that both had a troubled countenance, the elder showing signs of
      recent tears. She sought them out particularly for kind words during
      tea-time. After the reading she noticed them standing apart, talking to
      each other earnestly; she saw also that they frequently glanced at her. It
      occurred to her that they might wish to say something and had a difficulty
      in approaching. She went to them, and a question or two soon led the elder
      girl to disclose that she was indeed desirous of speaking in private.
      Giving a hand to each, she drew them a little apart. Then both children
      began to cry, and the elder sobbed out a pitiful story. Their mother was
      wretchedly ill and had sent them to implore Mrs. Mutimer&rsquo;s good word that
      the father might be allowed another chance. It was true he had got drunk&mdash;the
      words sounded terrible to Adela from the young lips&mdash;but he vowed
      that henceforth he would touch no liquor. It was ruin to the family to be
      sent away; Rendal might not find work for long enough; there would be
      nothing for it but to go to a Belwick slum as long as their money lasted,
      and thence to the workhouse. For it was well understood that no man who
      had worked at New Wanley need apply to the ordinary employers; they would
      have nothing to do with him. The mother would have come herself, but could
      not walk the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela was pierced with compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will do my best,&rsquo; she said, as soon as she could trust her voice. &lsquo;I
      promise you I will do my best.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not say more, and the children evidently hoped she would have
      been able to grant their father&rsquo;s pardon forthwith. They had to be content
      with Adela&rsquo;s promise, which did not sound very cheerful, but meant more
      than they could understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not do more than give such a promise, and even as she spoke
      there was a coldness about her heart. The coldness became a fear when she
      met her husband on his return from the works. Richard was not in the same
      good temper as at mid-day. He was annoyed to find Keene in the house&mdash;of
      late he had grown to dislike the journalist very cordially&mdash;and he
      had heard that the Rendal children had been to the party, which enraged
      him. You remember he accused the man of impudence in addition to the
      offence of drunkenness. Rendal, foolishly joking in his cups, had urged as
      extenuation of his own weakness the well-known fact that &lsquo;Arry Mutimer had
      been seen one evening unmistakably intoxicated in the street of Wanley
      village. Someone reported these words to Richard, and from that moment it
      was all over with the Rendals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela, in her eagerness to plead, quite forgot (or perhaps she had never
      known) that with a certain order of men it is never wise to prefer a
      request immediately before dinner. She was eager, too, to speak at once; a
      fear, which she would not allow to become definite, drove her upon the
      undertaking without delay. Meeting Richard on the stairs she begged him to
      come to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; he asked with small ceremony, as soon as the door closed
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She mastered her voice, and spoke with a sweet clearness of advocacy which
      should have moved his heart to proud and noble obeisance. Mutimer was not
      very accessible to such emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s like the fellow&rsquo;s impertinence,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to send his children to
      you. I&rsquo;m rather surprised you let them stay after what I had told you.
      Certainly I shall not overlook it. The thing&rsquo;s finished I it&rsquo;s no good
      talking about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fear had passed, but the coldness about her heart was more deadly. For
      a moment it seemed as if she could not bring herself to utter another
      word; she drew apart, she could not raise her face, which was beautiful in
      marble pain. But there came a rush of such hot anguish as compelled her to
      speak again. Something more than the fate of that poor family was at
      stake. Is not the quality of mercy indispensable to true nobleness? Had
      she voiced her very thought, Adela would have implored him to exalt
      himself in her eyes, to do a good deed which cost him some little effort
      over himself. For she divined with cruel certainty that it was not the
      principle that made him unyielding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Richard, are you sure that the man has offended before?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, of course he has. I&rsquo;ve no doubt of it. I remember feeling uncertain
      when I admitted him first of all. I didn&rsquo;t like his look.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you have not really had to complain of him before. Your suspicions <i>may</i>
      be groundless. And he has a good wife, I feel sure of that. The children
      are very clean and nicely dressed. She will help him to avoid drink in
      future. It is impossible for him to fail again, now that he knows how
      dreadful the results will be to his wife and his little girls.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pooh! What does he care about them? If I begin letting men off in that
      way, I shall be laughed at. There&rsquo;s an end of my authority. Don&rsquo;t bother
      your head about them. I must go and get ready for dinner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      An end of <i>my</i> authority. Yes, was it not the intelligence of her
      maiden heart returning to her? She had no pang from the mere refusal of a
      request of hers; Richard had never affected tenderness&mdash;not what she
      understood as tenderness&mdash;and she did not expect it of him. The union
      between them had another basis. But the understanding of his motives was
      so terribly distinct in her! It had come all at once; it was like the
      exposure of something dreadful by the sudden raising of a veil. And had
      she not known what the veil covered? Yet for the poor people&rsquo;s sake, for
      his own sake, she must try the woman&rsquo;s argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you refuse me, Richard? I will be guarantee for him. I promise you he
      shall not offend again. He shall apologise humbly to you for his&mdash;his
      words. You won&rsquo;t really refuse me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What nonsense! How can you promise for him, Adela? Ask for something
      reasonable, and you may be sure I shan&rsquo;t refuse you. The fellow has to go
      as a warning. It mustn&rsquo;t be thought we&rsquo;re only playing at making rules. I
      can&rsquo;t talk any more; I shall keep dinner waiting.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pride helped her to show a smooth face through the evening, and in the
      night she conquered herself anew. She expelled those crying children from
      her mind; she hardened her heart against their coming misery. It was wrong
      to judge her husband so summarily; nay, she had not judged him, but had
      given way to a wicked impulse, without leaving herself a moment to view
      the case. Did he not understand better than she what measures were
      necessary to the success of his most difficult undertaking? And then was
      it certain that expulsion meant ruin to the Rendals? Richard would insist
      on the letter of the regulations, just, as he said, for the example&rsquo;s
      sake; but of course he would see that the man was put in the way of
      getting new employment and did not suffer in the meantime. In the morning
      she made atonement to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was wrong in annoying you yesterday,&rsquo; she said as she walked with him
      from the house to the garden gate. &lsquo;In such things you are far better able
      to judge. You won&rsquo;t let it trouble you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a form of asceticism; Adela had a joy in humbling herself and
      crushing her rebel instincts. She even raised her eyes to interrogate him.
      On Richard&rsquo;s face was an uneasy smile, a look of puzzled reflection. It
      gratified him intensely to hear such words, yet he could not hear them
      without the suspicions of a vulgar nature brought in contact with
      nobleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, yes,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;I think you were a bit too hasty: you&rsquo;re not
      practical, you see. It wants a practical man to manage those kind of
      things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The reply was not such as completes the blessedness of pure submission.
      Adela averted her eyes. Another woman would perchance have sought to
      assure herself that she was right in crediting him with private
      benevolence to the family he was compelled to visit so severely. Such a
      question Adela could not ask. It would have been to betray doubt; she
      imagined a replying glance which would shame her. To love, to honour, to
      obey:&mdash;many times daily she repeated to herself that threefold vow,
      and hitherto the first article had most occupied her striving heart. But
      she must not neglect the second; perhaps it came first in natural order.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the gate Richard nodded to her kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye. Be a good girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      What was it that caused a painful flutter at her heart as he spoke so? She
      did not answer, but watched him for a few moments as he walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did <i>he</i> love <i>her</i>? The question which she had not asked
      herself for a long time came of that heart-tremor. She had been living so
      unnatural a life for a newly wedded woman, a life in which the intellect
      and the moral faculties held morbid predominance. &lsquo;Be a good girl.&rsquo; How
      was it that the simple phrase touched her to emotion quite different in
      kind from any thing she had known since her marriage, more deeply than any
      enthusiasm, as with a comfort more sacred than any she had known in
      prayer? As she turned to go back to the house a dizziness affected her
      eyes; she had to stand still for a moment. Involuntarily she clasped her
      hands upon her bosom and looked away into the blue summer sky. Did he love
      her? She had never asked him that, and all at once she felt a longing to
      hasten after him and utter the question. Would he know what she meant?
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it the instantaneous reward for having conscientiously striven to
      honour him? That there should be love on his side had not hitherto seemed
      of so much importance; probably she had taken it for granted; she had been
      so preoccupied with her own duties. Yet now it had all at once become of
      moment that she should know. &lsquo;Be a good girl.&rsquo; She repeated the words over
      and over again, and made much of them. Perhaps she had given him no
      opportunity, no encouragement, to say all he felt; she knew him to be
      reserved in many things.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she entered the house the dizziness again troubled her. But it passed
      as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keene, who had stayed over-night, was waiting to take leave of her;
      the trap which would carry him to Agworth station had just driven up.
      Adela surprised the poor journalist by the warmth with which she shook his
      hand, and the kindness of her farewell. She was not deceived as to the
      motive of his visit, and just now she allowed herself to feel sympathy for
      him, though in truth she did not like the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning she could not settle to her work. The dreaming mood was upon
      her, and she appeared rather to encourage it, seeking a quiet corner of
      the garden and watching for a whole hour the sun-dappled trunk of a great
      elm. At times her face seemed itself to be a source of light, so vivid
      were the thoughts that transformed it Her eyes were moist once or twice,
      and then no dream of artist-soul ever embodied such passionate loveliness,
      such holy awe, as came to view upon her countenance. At lunch she was
      almost silent, but Alice, happening to glance at her, experienced a
      surprise; she had never seen Adela so beautiful and so calmly bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      After lunch she attired herself for walking, and went to the village to
      see her mother. Lest Mrs. Waltham should be lonely, it had been arranged
      that Alfred should come home every evening, instead of once a week. Even
      thus, Adela had frequently reproached herself for neglecting her mother.
      Mrs. Waltham, however, enjoyed much content. The material comforts of her
      life were considerably increased, and she had many things in anticipation.
      Adela&rsquo;s unsatisfactory health rendered it advisable that the present year
      should pass in quietness, but Mrs. Waltham had made up her mind that
      before long there should be a house in London, with the delights
      appertaining thereto. She did not feel herself at all too old to enjoy the
      outside view of a London season; more than that it would probably be
      difficult to obtain just yet. To-day she was in excellent spirits, and
      welcomed her daughter exuberantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen Letty yet?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;To-day, I mean.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. Has she some news for me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alfred has an excellent chance of promotion. That old Wilkinson is dead,
      and he thinks there&rsquo;s no doubt he&rsquo;ll get the place. It would be two
      hundred and fifty a year.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s good news, indeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course it would mean Letty&rsquo;s immediate marriage. Mrs. Waltham discussed
      the prospect in detail. No doubt the best and simplest arrangement would
      be for the pair to live on in the same house. For the present, of course.
      Alfred was now firm on the commercial ladder, and in a few years his
      income would doubtless be considerable; then a dwelling of a very
      different kind could be found. With the wedding, too, she was occupying
      her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yours was not quite what it ought to have been, Adela. I felt it at the
      time, but then things were done in such a hurry. Of course the church must
      be decorated. The breakfast you will no doubt arrange to have at the
      Manor. Letty ought to have a nice, a really nice <i>trousseau</i>; I know
      you will be kind to her, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Alice had done, Mrs. Waltham noticed before long that Adela was far
      brighter than usual. She remarked upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You begin to look really well, my love. It makes me happy to see you. How
      much we have to be thankful for! I&rsquo;ve had a letter this morning from poor
      Lizzie Henbane; I must show it you. They&rsquo;re in such misery as never was.
      Her husband&rsquo;s business is all gone to nothing, and he is cruelly unkind to
      her. How thankful we ought to be!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely not for poor Lizzie&rsquo;s unhappiness!&rsquo; said Adela, with a return of
      her maiden archness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On our own account, my dear. We have had so much to contend against. At
      one time, just after your poor father&rsquo;s death, things looked very
      cheerless: I used to fret dreadfully on your account. But everything, you
      see, was for the best.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela had something to say and could not find the fitting moment. She
      first drew her chair a little nearer to her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, mother, I am happy,&rsquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Silly child! As if I didn&rsquo;t know best. It&rsquo;s always the same, but <i>you</i>
      had the good sense to trust to my experience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela slipped from her seat and put her arms about her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it, dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The reply was whispered. Adela&rsquo;s embrace grew closer; her face was hidden,
      and all at once she began to sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Love me, mother! Love me, dear mother!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham beamed with real tenderness. For half an hour they talked as
      mother and child alone can. Then Adela walked back to the Manor, still
      dreaming. She did not feel able to call and see Letty.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an afternoon postal delivery at Wanley, and the postman had just
      left the Manor as Adela returned. Alice, who for a wonder had been walking
      in the garden, saw the man going away, and, thinking it possible there
      might be a letter for her, entered the house to look. Three letters lay on
      the hall table; two were for Richard, the other was addressed to Mrs.
      Mutimer. This envelope Alice examined curiously. Whose writing could that
      be? She certainly knew it; it was a singular hand, stiff, awkward,
      untrained. Why, it was the writing of Emma&rsquo;s sister, Kate, Mrs. Clay. Not
      a doubt of it. Alice had received a note from Mrs. Clay at the time of
      Jane Vine&rsquo;s death, and remembered comparing the hand with her own and
      blessing herself that at all events she wrote with an elegant slope, and
      not in that hideous upright scrawl. The post-mark? Yes, it was London,
      E.C. But if Kate addressed a letter to Mrs. Mutimer it must be with
      sinister design, a design not at all difficult to imagine. Alice had a
      temptation. To take this letter and either open it herself or give it
      secretly to her brother? But the servant might somehow make it known that
      such a letter had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anything for me, Alice?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Adela&rsquo;s voice. She had approached unheard; Alice was so intent upon
      her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, one letter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no help for it. Alice glanced at her sister-in-law, and strolled
      away again into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela examined the envelope. She could not conjecture from whom the letter
      came; certainly from some illiterate person. Was it for her husband? Was
      not the &lsquo;Mrs.&rsquo; a mistake for &lsquo;Mr.&rsquo; or perhaps mere ill-writing that
      deceived the eye? No, the prefix was so very distinct. She opened the
      envelope where she stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Mutimer, I dare say you don&rsquo;t know me nor my name, but I write to
      you because I think it only right as you should know the truth about your
      husband, and because me and my sister can&rsquo;t go on any longer as we are. My
      sister&rsquo;s name is Emma Vine. She was engaged to be married to Richard M.
      two years before he knew you, and to the last he put her off with
      make-believe and promises, though it was easy to see what was meant. And
      when our sister Jane was on her very death-bed, which she died not a week
      after he married you, and I know well as it was grief as killed her. And
      now we haven&rsquo;t got enough to eat for Emma and me and my two little
      children, for I am a widow myself. But that isn&rsquo;t all. Because he found
      that his friends in Hoxton was crying shame on him, he got it said as Emma
      had misbehaved herself, which was a cowardly lie, and all to protect
      himself. And now Emma is that ill she can&rsquo;t work; it&rsquo;s come upon her all
      at once, and what&rsquo;s going to happen God knows. And his own mother cried
      shame on him, and wouldn&rsquo;t live no longer in the big house in Highbury. He
      offered us money&mdash;I will say so much&mdash;but Emma was too proud,
      and wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it. And then he went giving her a bad name. What do
      you think of your husband now, Mrs. Mutimer? I don&rsquo;t expect nothing, but
      it&rsquo;s only right you should know. Emma wouldn&rsquo;t take anything, not if she
      was dying of starvation, but I&rsquo;ve got my children to think of. So that&rsquo;s
      all I have to say, and I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve said it.&mdash;Yours truly, KATE
      CLAY.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela remained standing for a few moments when she had finished the
      letter, then went slowly to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice returned from the garden in a short time. In passing through the
      hall she looked again at the two letters which remained. Neither of them
      had a sinister appearance; being addressed to the Manor they probably came
      from personal friends. She went to the drawing-room and glanced around for
      Adela, but the room was empty. Richard would not be home for an hour yet;
      she took up a novel and tried to pass the time so, but she had a
      difficulty in fixing her attention. In the end she once more left the
      house, and, after a turn or two on the lawn, strolled out of the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      She met her brother a hundred yards along the road. The sight of her
      astonished him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s up now, Princess?&rsquo; he exclaimed. &lsquo;House on fire? Novels run
      short?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something that I expect you won&rsquo;t care to hear. Who do you think&rsquo;s been
      writing to Adela? Someone in London.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard stayed his foot, and looked at his sister with the eyes which
      suggested disagreeable possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who do you mean?&rsquo; he asked briefly. &lsquo;Not mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The change in him was very sudden. He had been merry and smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; worse than that. She&rsquo;s got a letter from Kate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From Kate? Emma&rsquo;s sister?&rsquo; he asked in a low voice of surprise which
      would have been dismay had he not governed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I saw it on the hall table; I remember her writing well enough. Just as I
      was looking at it Adela came in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you seen her since?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice shook her head. She had this way of saving words. Richard walked on.
      His first movement of alarm had passed, and now he affected to take the
      matter with indifference. During the week immediately following his
      marriage he had been prepared for this very incident; the possibility had
      been one of the things he faced with a certain recklessness. But impunity
      had set his mind at ease, and the news in the first instant struck him
      with a trepidation which a few minutes&rsquo; thought greatly allayed. By a
      mental process familiar enough he at first saw the occurrence as he had
      seen it in the earlier days of his temptation, when his sense of honour
      yet gave him frequent trouble; he had to exert himself to recover his
      present standpoint. At length he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just like that woman,&rsquo; he said, turning half an eye on Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If she means trouble, you&rsquo;ll have it,&rsquo; returned the girl sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s no doubt over by this time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Over? Beginning, I should say,&rsquo; remarked Alice, swinging her parasol at a
      butterfly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They finished their walk to the house in silence, and Richard went at once
      to his dressing-room. Here he sat down. After all, his mental disquiet was
      not readily to be dismissed; it even grew as he speculated and viewed
      likelihoods from all sides. Probably Kate had made a complete disclosure.
      How would it affect Adela?
    </p>
    <p>
      You must not suppose that his behaviour in the case of the man Rendal had
      argued disregard for Adela&rsquo;s opinion of him. Richard was incapable of
      understanding how it struck his wife, that was all. If he reflected on the
      matter, no doubt he was very satisfied with himself, feeling that he had
      displayed a manly resolution and consistency. But the present difficulty
      was grave. Whatever Adela might say, there could be no doubt as to her
      thought; she would henceforth&mdash;yes, despise him. That cut his thick
      skin to the quick; his nature was capable of smarting when thus assailed.
      For he had by no means lost his early reverence for Adela; nay, in a sense
      it had increased. His primitive ideas on woman had undergone a change
      since his marriage. Previously he had considered a wife in the light of
      property; intellectual or moral independence he could not attribute to
      her. But he had learnt that Adela was by no means his chattel. He still
      knew diffidence when he was inclined to throw a joke at her, and could not
      take her hand without involuntary respect&mdash;a sensation which
      occasionally irritated him. A dim inkling of what was meant by woman&rsquo;s
      strength and purity had crept into his mind; he knew&mdash;in his heart he
      knew&mdash;that he was unworthy to touch her garment. And, to face the
      whole truth, he all but loved her; that was the meaning of his mingled
      sentiments with regard to her. A danger of losing her in the material
      sense would have taught him that better than he as yet knew it; the fear
      of losing her respect was not attributable solely to his restless egoism.
      He had wedded her in quite another frame of mind than that in which he now
      found himself when he thought of her. He cared much for the high opinion
      of people in general; Adela was all but indispensable to him. When he
      said, &lsquo;My wife,&rsquo; he must have been half-conscious that the word bore a
      significance different from that he had contemplated. On the lips of those
      among whom he had grown up the word is desecrated, or for the most part
      so; it has contemptible, and ridiculous, and vile associations, scarcely
      ever its true meaning. Formerly he would have laughed at the thought of
      standing in awe of his wife; nay, he could not have conceived the
      possibility of such a thing; it would have appeared unnatural,
      incompatible with the facts of wedded life. Yet he sat here and almost
      dreaded to enter her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man of more culture might have thought: A woman cannot in her heart be
      revolted because another has been cast off for her. Mutimer could not
      reason so far. It would have been reasoning inapplicable to Adela, but
      from a certain point of view it might have served as a resource. Richard
      could only accept his instincts.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was useless to postpone the interview; come of it what would, he
      must have it over and done with. He could not decide how to speak until he
      knew what the contents of Kate&rsquo;s letter were. He was nervously anxious to
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela sat in her boudoir, with a book open on her lap. After the first
      glance on his entering she kept her eyes down. He sauntered up and stood
      before her in an easy attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who has been writing to you from London?&rsquo; he at once asked, abruptly in
      consequence of the effort to speak without constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela was not prepared for such a question. She remembered all at once
      that Alice had seen the letter as it lay on the table. Why had Alice
      spoken to her brother about it? There could be only one explanation of
      that, and of his coming thus directly. She raised her eyes for a moment,
      and a slight shock seemed to affect her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was unconscious how long she delayed her reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell me?&rsquo; Richard said, with more roughness than he intended.
      He was suffering, and suffering affected his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela drew the letter from her pocket and in silence handed it to him. He
      read it quickly, and, before the end was reached, had promptly chosen his
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think of this?&rsquo; was his question, as he folded the letter and
      rolled it in his hand. He was smiling, and enjoyed complete self-command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot think,&rsquo; fell from Adela&rsquo;s lips. &lsquo;I am waiting for jour words.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He noticed at length, now he was able to inspect her calmly, that she
      looked faint, pain-stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alice told me who had written to you,&rsquo; Richard pursued, in his frankest
      tones. &lsquo;It was well she saw the letter; you might have said nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That would have been very unjust to you,&rsquo; said Adela in a low regular
      voice. &lsquo;I could only have done that if&mdash;if I had believed it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t altogether believe it, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with full eyes and made answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are my husband.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It echoed in his ears; not to many men does it fall to hear those words so
      spoken. Another would have flung himself at her feet and prayed to her.
      Mutimer only felt a vast relief, mingled with gratitude. The man all but
      flattered himself that she had done him justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you are quite right,&rsquo; he spoke. &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t true, and if you knew
      this woman you would understand the whole affair. I dare say you can
      gather a good deal from the way she writes. It&rsquo;s true enough that I was
      engaged to her sister, but it was broken off before I knew you, and for
      the reasons she says here. I&rsquo;m not going to talk to you about things of
      that kind; I dare say you wouldn&rsquo;t care to hear them. Of course she says I
      made it all up. Do you think I&rsquo;m the kind of man to do that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps she did not know that she was gazing at him. The question
      interrupted her in a train of thought which was going on in her mind even
      while she listened. She was asking herself why, when they were in London,
      he had objected to a meeting between her and his mother. He had said his
      mother was a crotchety old woman who could not make up her mind to the
      changed circumstances, and was intensely prejudiced against women above
      her own class. Was that a very convincing description? She had accepted it
      at the time, but now, after reading this letter&mdash;? But could any man
      speak with that voice and that look, and lie? Her agitation grew
      intolerable. Answer she must; could she, could she say &lsquo;No&rsquo; with truth?
      Answer she must, for he waited. In the agony of striving for voice there
      came upon her once more that dizziness of the morning, but in a more
      severe form. She struggled, felt her breath failing, tried to rise, and
      fell back unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time Alice was sitting in the drawing-room, in conversation
      with Mr. Willis Rodman. &lsquo;Arry having been invited for this evening, Rodman
      was asked with him, as had been the case before. &lsquo;Arry was at present
      amusing himself in the stables, exchanging sentiments with the groom.
      Rodman sat near Alice, or rather he knelt upon a chair, so that at any
      moment he could assume a standing attitude before her. He talked in a low
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll come out to-night?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, not to-night. You must speak to him to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodman mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; resumed the girl eagerly, in a tone as unlike that
      she used to Mr. Keene as well could be. She was in earnest; her eyes never
      moved from her companion&rsquo;s face; her lips trembled. &lsquo;Why should you put it
      off? I can&rsquo;t see why we keep it a secret. Dick can&rsquo;t have a word to say
      against it; you know he can&rsquo;t. Tell him to-night after dinner. Do! do!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodman frowned in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t like it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why not? I believe he will. He will, he shall, he must! I&rsquo;m not to
      depend on him, surely?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A day or two more, Alice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t keep up the shamming!&rsquo; she exclaimed. &lsquo;Adela suspects, I feel
      sure. Whenever you come in I feel that hot and red.&rsquo; She laughed and
      blushed. &lsquo;If you won&rsquo;t do as I tell you, I&rsquo;ll give you up, I will indeed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodman stroked his moustache, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will, will you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See if I don&rsquo;t. To-night! It must be to-night! Shall I call you a pretty
      name? it&rsquo;s only because I couldn&rsquo;t bear to be found out before you tell
      him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He still stroked his moustache. His handsome face was half amused, half
      troubled. At last he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well; to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after, Mutimer came into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Adela isn&rsquo;t up to the mark,&rsquo; he said to Alice. &lsquo;She&rsquo;d better have dinner
      by herself, I think; but she&rsquo;ll join us afterwards.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother and sister exchanged looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s only a headache or something of the kind,&rsquo; he continued. &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll
      be all right soon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he began to talk with Rodman cheerfully, so that Alice felt it must
      really be all right. She drew aside and looked into a novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela did appear after dinner, very pale and silent, but with a smile on
      her face. There had been no further conversation between her and her
      husband. She talked a little with &lsquo;Arry, in her usual gentle way, then
      asked to be allowed to say goodnight. &lsquo;Arry at the same time took his
      leave, having been privately bidden to do so by his sister. He was glad
      enough to get away; in the drawing-room his limbs soon began to ache, from
      inability to sit at his ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Alice withdrew, and the men were left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela did not go to bed. She suffered from the closeness of the evening
      and sat by her open windows, trying to read a chapter in the New
      Testament. About eleven o&rsquo;clock she had a great desire to walk upon the
      garden grass for a few minutes before undressing; perhaps it might help
      her to the sleep she so longed for yet feared she would not obtain. The
      desire became so strong that she yielded to it, passed quietly downstairs,
      and out into the still night. She directed her steps to her favourite
      remote corner. There was but little moonlight, and scarcely a star was
      visible. When she neared the laburnums behind which she often sat or
      walked, her ear caught the sound of voices. They came nearer, on the other
      side of the trees. The first word which she heard distinctly bound her to
      the spot and forced her to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t put it off.&rsquo; It was Alice speaking. &lsquo;I know what comes of
      that kind of thing. I am old enough to be my own mistress.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not twenty-one,&rsquo; replied Richard in an annoyed voice. &lsquo;I shall do
      everything I can to put it off till you are of age. Rodman is a good
      enough fellow in his place; but it isn&rsquo;t hard to see why he&rsquo;s talked you
      over in this way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He hasn&rsquo;t talked me over!&rsquo; cried Alice, passionately. &lsquo;I needn&rsquo;t have
      listened if I hadn&rsquo;t liked.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a foolish girl, and you want someone to look after you. If you&rsquo;ll
      only wait you can make a good marriage. This would be a bad one, in every
      sense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall marry him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I shall prevent it. It&rsquo;s for your own sake, Alice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you try to prevent it&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell Adela everything about Emma I
      I&rsquo;ll tell her the whole plain truth, and I&rsquo;ll prove it to her. So hinder
      me if you dare!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice hastened away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the month of September Mr. Wyvern was called upon to unite in holy
      matrimony two pairs in whom we are interested. Alice Mutimer became Mrs.
      Willis Rodman, and Alfred Waltham took home a bride who suited him
      exactly, seeing that she was never so happy as when submitting herself to
      a stronger will. Alfred and Letty ran away and hid themselves in South
      Wales. Mr. and Mrs. Rodman fled to the Continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half Alice&rsquo;s fortune was settled upon herself, her brother and Alfred
      Waltham being trustees. This was all Mutimer could do. He disliked the
      marriage intensely, and not only because he had set his heart on a far
      better match for Alice; he had no real confidence in Rodman. Though the
      latter&rsquo;s extreme usefulness and personal tact had from the first led
      Richard to admit him to terms of intimacy, time did not favour the
      friendship. Mutimer, growing daily more ambitious and more punctilious in
      his intercourse with all whom, notwithstanding his principles, he deemed
      inferiors from the social point of view, often regretted keenly that he
      had allowed any relation between himself and Rodman more than that of
      master and man. Experience taught him how easily he might have made the
      most of Rodman without granting him a single favour. The first suggestion
      of the marriage enraged him; in the conversation with Rodman, which took
      place, moreover, at an unfavourable moment, he lost his temper and flung
      out very broad hints indeed as to the suitor&rsquo;s motives. Rodman was calm;
      life had instructed him in the advantages of a curbed tongue; but there
      was heightened colour on his face, and his demeanour much resembled that
      of a proud man who cares little to justify himself, but will assuredly
      never forget an insult. It was one of the peculiarities of this gentleman
      that his exterior was most impressive when the inner man was most busy
      with ignoble or venomous thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for Alice&rsquo;s sake Mutimer could not persist in his hostility. Alice had
      a weapon which he durst not defy, and, the marriage being inevitable, he
      strove hard to see it in a more agreeable light, even tried to convince
      himself that his prejudice against Rodman was groundless. He loved his
      sister, and for her alone would put up with things otherwise intolerable.
      It was a new exasperation when he discovered that Rodman could not be
      persuaded to continue his work at New Wanley. All inducements proved vain.
      Richard had hoped that at least one advantage might come of the marriage,
      that Rodman would devote capital to the works; but Rodman&rsquo;s Socialism
      cooled strangely from the day when his ends were secured. He purposed
      living in London, and Alice was delighted to encourage him. The girl had
      visions of a life such as the heroines of certain novels rejoice in. For a
      wonder, her husband was indispensable to the brightness of that future.
      Rodman had inspired her with an infatuation. Their relations once
      declared, she grudged him every moment he spent away from her. It was
      strangely like true passion, the difference only marked by an extravagant
      selfishness. She thought of no one, cared for no one, but herself, Rodman
      having become part of that self. With him she was imperiously slavish; her
      tenderness was a kind of greed; she did not pretend to forgive her brother
      for his threatened opposition, and, having got hold of the idea that Adela
      took part against Rodman, she hated her and would not be alone in her
      company for a moment. On her marriage day she refused Adela&rsquo;s offered kiss
      and did her best to let everyone see how delighted she was to leave them
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The autumn was a time of physical suffering for Adela. Formerly she had
      sought to escape her mother&rsquo;s attentions, now she accepted them with
      thankfulness. Mrs. Waltham had grave fears for her daughter; doctors
      suspected some organic disease, one summoned from London going so far as
      to hint at a weakness of the chest. Early in November it was decided to go
      south for the winter, and Exmouth was chosen, chiefly because Mrs.
      Westlake was spending a month there. Mr. Westlake, whose interest in Adela
      had grown with each visit he paid to the Manor, himself suggested the
      plan. Mrs. Waltham and Adela left Wanley together; Mutimer promised visits
      as often as he could manage to get away. Since Rodman&rsquo;s departure Richard
      found himself overwhelmed with work. None the less he resolutely pursued
      the idea of canvassing Belwick at the coming general election. Opposition,
      from whomsoever it came, aggravated him. He was more than ever troubled
      about the prospects of New Wanley; there even loomed before his mind a
      possible abandonment of the undertaking. He had never contemplated the
      sacrifice of his fortune, and though anything of that kind was still very
      far off, it was daily more difficult for him to face with equanimity even
      moderate losses. Money had fostered ambition, and ambition full grown had
      more need than ever of its nurse. New Wanley was no longer an end in
      itself, but a stepping-stone You must come to your own conclusions in
      judging the value of Mutimer&rsquo;s social zeal; the facts of his life up to
      this time are before you, and you will not forget how complex a matter is
      the mind of a strong man with whom circumstances have dealt so strangely.
      His was assuredly not the vulgar self-seeking of the gilded <i>bourgeois</i>
      who covets an after-dinner sleep on Parliamentary benches. His ignorance
      of the machinery of government was profound; though he spoke scornfully of
      Parliament and its members, he had no conception of those powers of
      dulness and respectability which seize upon the best men if folly lures
      them within the precincts of St. Stephen&rsquo;s. He thought, poor fellow! that
      he could rise in his place and thunder forth his indignant eloquence as he
      did in Commonwealth Hall and elsewhere; he imagined a conscience-stricken
      House, he dreamed of passionate debates on a Bill which really had the
      good of the people for its sole object. Such Bill would of course bear <i>his</i>
      name; shall we condemn him for that?
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela was at Exmouth, drinking the mild air, wondering whether there was
      in truth a life to come, and, if so, whether it was a life wherein Love
      and Duty were at one. A year ago such thoughts could not have entered her
      mind. But she had spent several weeks in close companionship with Stella
      Westlake, and Stella&rsquo;s influence was subtle. Mrs. Westlake had come here
      to regain strength after a confinement; the fact drew her near to Adela,
      whose time for giving birth to a child was not far off.

    <p>
      Adela at first regarded this friend with much the same feeling of awe as
      mingled with Letty&rsquo;s affection for Adela herself. Stella Westlake was not
      only possessed of intellectual riches which Adela had had no opportunity
      of gaining; her character was so full of imaginative force, of dreamy
      splendours, that it addressed itself to a mind like Adela&rsquo;s with magic
      irresistible and permanent. No rules of the polite world applied to
      Stella; she spoke and acted with an independence so spontaneous that it
      did not suggest conscious opposition to the received ways of thought to
      which ordinary women are confined, but rather a complete ignorance of
      them. Adela felt herself startled, but never shocked, even when the
      originality went most counter to her own prejudices; it was as though she
      had drunk a draught of most unexpected flavour, the effect of which was to
      set her nerves delightfully trembling, and make her long to taste it
      again. It was not an occasional effect, the result of an effort on
      Stella&rsquo;s part to surprise or charm; the commonest words had novel meanings
      when uttered in her voice; a profound sincerity seemed to inspire every
      lightest question or remark. Her presence was agitating; she had but to
      enter the room and sit in silence, and Adela forthwith was raised from the
      depression of her broodings to a vividness of being, an imaginative
      energy, such as she had never known. Adela doubted for some time whether
      Stella regarded her with affection; the little demonstrations in which
      women are wont to indulge were incompatible with that grave dreaminess,
      and Stella seemed to avoid even the common phrases of friendship. But one
      day, when Adela had not been well enough to rise, and as she lay on the
      borderland of sleeping and waking, she half dreamt, half knew, that a face
      bent over her, and that lips were pressed against her own; and such a
      thrill struck through her that, though now fully conscious, she had not
      power to stir, but lay as in the moment of some rapturous death. For when
      the presence entered into her dream, when the warmth melted upon her lips,
      she imagined it the kiss which might once have come to her but now was
      lost for ever. It was pain to open her eyes, but when she did so, and met
      Stella&rsquo;s silent gaze, she knew that love was offered her, a love of which
      it was needless to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham was rather afraid of Stella; privately she doubted whether
      the poor thing was altogether in her perfect mind. When the visitor came
      the mother generally found occupation or amusement elsewhere, conversation
      with Stella was so extremely difficult. Mr. Westlake was also at Exmouth,
      but much engaged in literary work. There was, too, an artist and his
      family, with whom the Westlakes were acquainted, their name Boscobel. Mrs.
      Boscobel was a woman of the world, five-and-thirty, charming, intelligent;
      she read little, but was full of interest in literary and artistic
      matters, and talked as only a woman can who has long associated with men
      of brains. To her Adela was interesting, personally and still more as an
      illustration of a social experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How young she is!&rsquo; was her remark to Mr. Westlake shortly after making
      Adela&rsquo;s acquaintance. &lsquo;It will amuse you, the thought I had; I really must
      tell it you. She realises my idea of a virgin mother. Haven&rsquo;t you felt
      anything of the kind?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Westlake smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I understand. Stella said something evidently traceable to the same
      impression; her voice, she said, is full of forgiveness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excellent! And has she much to forgive, do you think?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yet she is not exactly happy, I imagine?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Westlake did not care to discuss the subject. The lady had recourse to
      Stella for some account of Mr. Mutimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a strong man,&rsquo; Stella said in a tone which betrayed the Socialist&rsquo;s
      enthusiasm. &lsquo;He stands for earth-subduing energy. I imagine him at a
      forge, beating fire out of iron.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;H&rsquo;m! That&rsquo;s not quite the same thing as imagining him that beautiful
      child&rsquo;s husband. No education, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sufficient. With more, he would no longer fill the place he does. He can
      speak eloquently; he is the true voice of the millions who cannot speak
      their own thoughts. If he were more intellectual he would become
      commonplace; I hope he will never see further than he does now. Isn&rsquo;t a
      perfect type more precious than a man who is neither one thing nor
      another?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Artistically speaking, by all means.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In his case I don&rsquo;t mean it artistically. He is doing a great work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A friend of mine&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know Hubert Eldon, I think?&mdash;tells
      me he has ruined one of the loveliest valleys in England.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I dare say he has done that. It is an essential part of his protest
      against social wrong. The earth renews itself, but a dead man or woman who
      has lived without joy can never be recompensed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She, of course, is strongly of the same opinion?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Adela is a Socialist.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boscobel laughed rather satirically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I doubt it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Stella, when she went to sit with Adela, either at home or by the
      sea-shore, often carried a book in her hand, and at Adela&rsquo;s request she
      read aloud. In this way Adela first came to know what was meant by
      literature, as distinguished from works of learning. The verse of Shelley
      and the prose of Landor fell upon her ears; it was as though she had
      hitherto lived in deafness. Sometimes she had to beg the reader to pause
      for that day; her heart and mind seemed overfull; she could not even speak
      of these new things, but felt the need of lying back in twilight to marvel
      and repeat melodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boscobel happened to approach them once whilst this reading was going
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are educating her?&rsquo; she said to Stella afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps&mdash;a little,&rsquo; Stella replied absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it just a trifle dangerous?&rsquo; suggested the understanding lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dangerous? How?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wife of the man who makes sparks fly out of iron? The man who is on
      no account to learn anything?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Stella shook her head, saying, &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should much like to,&rsquo; was Mrs. Boscobel&rsquo;s smiling rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Stella&rsquo;s company it did not seem very likely that Adela would lose her
      social enthusiasm, yet danger there was, and that precisely on account of
      Mrs. Westlake&rsquo;s idealist tendencies. When she spoke of the toiling
      multitude, she saw them in a kind of exalted vision; she beheld them
      glorious in their woe, ennobled by the tyranny under which they groaned.
      She had seen little if anything of the representative proletarian, and
      perchance even if she had the momentary impression would have faded in the
      light of her burning soul. Now Adela was in the very best position for
      understanding those faults of the working class which are ineradicable in
      any one generation. She knew her husband, knew him better than ever now
      that she regarded him from a distance; she knew &lsquo;Arry Mutimer; and now she
      was getting to appreciate with a thoroughness impossible hitherto, the
      monstrous gulf between men of that kind and cultured human beings. She
      had, too, studied the children and the women of New Wanley, and the
      results of such study were arranging themselves in her mind. All
      unconsciously, Stella Westlake was cooling Adela&rsquo;s zeal with every fervid
      word she uttered; Adela at times with difficulty restrained herself from
      crying, &lsquo;But it is a mistake! They have not these feelings you attribute
      to them. Such suffering as you picture them enduring comes only of the
      poetry-fed soul at issue with fate.&rsquo; She could not as yet have so
      expressed herself, but the knowledge was growing within her. For Adela was
      not by nature a social enthusiast. When her heart leapt at Stella&rsquo;s chant,
      it was not in truth through contagion of sympathy, but in admiration and
      love of the noble woman who could thus think and speak. Adela&mdash;and
      who will not be thankful for it?&mdash;was, before all things, feminine;
      her true enthusiasms were personal. It was a necessity of her nature to
      love a human being, this or that one, not a crowd. She had been starving,
      killing the self which was her value. This home on the Devon coast
      received her like an earthly paradise; looking back on New Wanley, she saw
      it murky and lurid; it was hard to believe that the sun ever shone there.
      But for the most part, she tried to keep it altogether from her mind,
      tried to dissociate her husband from his public tasks, and to remember him
      as the man with whom her life was irrevocably bound up. When delight in
      Stella&rsquo;s poetry was followed by fear, she strengthened herself by thought
      of the child she bore beneath her heart; for that child&rsquo;s sake she would
      accept the beautiful things offered to her, some day to bring them, as
      rich gifts to the young life. Her own lot was fixed; she might not muse
      upon it, she durst not consider it too deeply. There were things in the
      past which she had determined, if by any means it were possible, utterly
      to forget. For the future, there was her child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer came to Exmouth when she had been there three weeks, and he stayed
      four days. Mrs. Boscobel had an opportunity of making his acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who contrived that marriage?&rsquo; she asked of Mr. Westlake subsequently.
      &lsquo;Our lady mother, presumably.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no reason to think it was not well done,&rsquo; replied Mr. Westlake
      with reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most skilfully done, no doubt,&rsquo; rejoined the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the end of the year, the Westlakes returned to London, the
      Boscobels shortly after. Mrs. Waltham and her daughter had made no other
      close connections, and Adela&rsquo;s health alone allowed of her leaving the
      house for a short drive on sunny days. At the end of February the child
      was born prematurely; it entered the world only to leave it again. For a
      week they believed that Adela would die. Scarcely was she pronounced out
      of danger by the end of March. But after that she recovered strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      May saw her at Wanley once more. She had become impatient to return. The
      Parliamentary elections were very near at hand, and Mutimer almost lived
      in Belwick; it seemed to Adela that duty required her to be near him, as
      well as to supply his absence from New Wanley as much as was possible. She
      was still only the ghost of her former self, but disease no longer
      threatened her, and activity alone could completely restore her health.
      She was anxious to recommence her studies, to resume her readings to the
      children; and she desired to see Mr. Wyvern. She understood by this time
      why he had chosen Andersen&rsquo;s Tales for her readings; of many other things
      which he had said, causing her doubt, the meaning was now clear enough to
      her. She had so much to talk of with the vicar, so many questions to put
      to him, not a few of a kind that would&mdash;she thought&mdash;surprise
      and trouble him. None the less, they must be asked and answered. Part of
      her desire to see him again was merely the result of her longing for the
      society of well-read and thoughtful people. She knew that he would appear
      to her in a different light from formerly; she would be far better able to
      understand him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began by seeking his opinion of her husband&rsquo;s chances in Belwick. Mr.
      Wyvern shook his head and said frankly that he thought there was no chance
      at all. Mutimer was looked upon in the borough as a mischievous
      interloper, who came to make disunion in the Radical party. The son of a
      lord and an ironmaster of great influence were the serious candidates. Had
      he seen fit, Mr. Wyvern could have mentioned not a few lively incidents in
      the course of the political warfare; such, for instance, as the appearance
      of a neat little pamphlet which purported to give a full and complete
      account of Mutimer&rsquo;s life. In this pamphlet nothing untrue was set down,
      nor did it contain anything likely to render its publisher amenable to the
      law of libel; but the writer, a gentleman closely connected with Comrade
      Roodhouse, most skilfully managed to convey the worst possible impression
      throughout. Nor did the vicar hesitate to express his regret that Mutimer
      should be seeking election at all. Adela felt with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found Richard in a strange state of chronic excitement. On whatever
      subject he spoke it was with the same nervous irritation, and the
      slightest annoyance set him fuming. To her he paid very little attention,
      and for the most part seemed disinclined to converse with her; Adela found
      it necessary to keep silence on political matters; once or twice he
      replied to her questions with a rough impatience which kept her miserable
      throughout the day, so much had it revealed of the working man. As the
      election day approached she suffered from a sinking of the heart, almost a
      bodily fear; a fear the same in kind as that of the wretched woman who
      anticipates the return of a brute-husband late on Saturday night. The same
      in kind; no reasoning would overcome it. She worked hard all day long,
      that at night she might fall on deep sleep. Again she had taken up her
      hard German books, and was also busy with French histories of revolution,
      which did indeed fascinate her, though, as she half perceived, solely by
      the dramatic quality of the stories they told. And at length the morning
      of her fear had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he left home Mutimer bade her not expect him till the following day.
      She spent the hours in loneliness and misery. Mr. Wyvern called, but even
      him she begged through a servant to excuse her; her mother likewise came,
      and her she talked with for a few minutes, then pleaded headache. At nine
      o&rsquo;clock in the evening she went to her bedroom. She had a soporific at
      hand, remaining from the time of her illness, and in dread of a sleepless
      night she had recourse to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to her that she had slept a very long time when a great and
      persistent noise awoke her. It was someone knocking at her door, even, as
      she at length became aware, turning the handle and shaking it. Being
      alone, she had locked herself in. She sprang from bed, put on her
      dressing-gown, and went to the door. Then came her husband&rsquo;s voice,
      impatiently calling her name. She admitted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the white blind the morning twilight just made objects visible in
      the room; Adela afterwards remembered noticing the drowsy pipe of a bird
      near the window. Mutimer came in, and, without closing the door, began to
      demand angrily why she had locked him out. Only now she quite shook off
      her sleep, and could perceive that there was something unusual in his
      manner. He smelt strongly of tobacco, and, as she fancied, of spirits; but
      it was his staggering as he moved to draw up the blind that made her aware
      of his condition. She found afterwards that he had driven all the way from
      Belwick, and the marvel was that he had accomplished such a feat; probably
      his horse deserved most of the credit. When he had pulled the blind up, he
      turned, propped himself against the dressing-table, and gazed at her with
      terribly lack-lustre eyes. Then she saw the expression of his face change;
      there came upon it a smile such as she had never seen or imagined, a
      hideous smile that made her blood cold. Without speaking, he threw himself
      forward and came towards her. For an instant she was powerless, paralysed
      with terror; but happily she found utterance for a cry, and that released
      her limbs. Before he could reach her, she had darted out of the room, and
      fled to another chamber, that which Alice had formerly occupied, where she
      locked herself against him. To her surprise he did not discover her
      retreat; she heard him moving about the passages, stumbling here and
      there, then he seemed to return to his bedroom. She wrapped herself in a
      counterpane, and sat in a chair till it was full morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was absent for a week after that. Of course his polling at the election
      had been ridiculously small compared with that of the other candidates.
      When he returned he went about his ordinary occupations; he was seemingly
      not in his usual health, but the constant irritableness had left him.
      Adela tried to bear herself as though nothing unwonted had come to pass,
      but Mutimer scarcely spoke when at home; if he addressed her it was in a
      quick, off-hand way, and without looking at her. Adela again lived almost
      alone. Her mother and Letty understood that she preferred this. Letty had
      many occupations; before long she hoped to welcome her first child. The
      children of New Wanley still came once a week to the Manor; Adela
      endeavoured to amuse them, to make them thoughtful, but it had become a
      hard, hard task. Only with Mr. Wyvern did she occasionally speak without
      constraint, though not of course without reserve; speech of <i>that</i>
      kind she feared would never again be possible to her. Still she felt that
      the vicar saw far into her life. On some topics she was more open than she
      had hitherto ventured to be; a boldness, almost a carelessness, for which
      she herself could not account, possessed her at such times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in June she received from Stella Westlake a pressing invitation to
      come and spend a fortnight in London. It was like sunshine to her heart;
      almost without hesitation she re solved to accept it. Her husband offered
      no objection, seemed to treat the proposal with indifference. Later in the
      day he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you have time, you might perhaps give Alice a call.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall do that as soon as ever I can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had something else to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps Mrs. Westlake might ask her to come, whilst you are there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very likely, I think,&rsquo; Adela replied, with an attempt at confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only her second visit to London: the first had been in winter time,
      and under conditions which had not allowed her to attend to anything she
      saw. But for Stella&rsquo;s presence there she would have feared London; her
      memory of it was like that of an ill dream long past; her mind only
      reverted to it in darkest hours, and then she shuddered. But now she
      thought only of Stella; Stella was light and joy, a fountain of magic
      waters. Her arrival at the house in Avenue Road was one of the most
      blissful moments she had ever known. The servant led her upstairs to a
      small room, where the veiled sun made warmth on rich hangings, on
      beautiful furniture, on books and pictures, on ferns and flowers. The
      goddess of this sanctuary was alone; as the door opened the notes of a
      zither trembled into silence, and Adela saw a light-robed loveliness rise
      and stand before her. Stella took both her hands very gently, then looked
      into her face with eyes which seemed to be new from some high vision, then
      drew her within the paradise of an embrace. The kiss was once more like
      that first touch of lips which had come to Adela on the verge of sleep;
      she quivered through her frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Westlake shortly joined them, and spoke with an extreme kindness which
      completed Adela&rsquo;s sense of being at home. No one disturbed them through
      the evening; Adela went to bed early and slept without a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stella and her husband talked of her in the night. Mr. Westlake had, at
      the time of the election, heard for the first time the story of Mutimer
      and the obscure work-girl in Hoxton, and had taken some trouble to
      investigate it. It had not reached his ears when the Hoxton Socialists
      made it a subject of public discussion; Comrade Roodhouse had inserted
      only a very general report of the proceedings in his paper the &lsquo;Tocsin,
      and even this Mr. Westlake had not seen. But a copy of the pamphlet which
      circulated in Belwick came into his hands, and when he began to talk on
      the subject with an intimate friend, who, without being a Socialist,
      amused himself with following the movement closely, he heard more than he
      liked. To Stella he said nothing of all this. His own ultimate judgment
      was that you cannot expect men to be perfect, and that great causes have
      often been served by very indifferent characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She looks shockingly ill,&rsquo; he began to-night when alone with Stella.
      &lsquo;Wasn&rsquo;t there something said about consumption when she was at Exmouth?
      Has she any cough?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think it is that,&rsquo; Stella answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She seems glad to be with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very glad, I think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did the loss of her child affect her deeply?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot say. She has never spoken of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor child!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Stella made no reply to the exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Adela went to call on Mrs. Rodman. It was a house in
      Bayswater, not large, but richly furnished. Adela chose a morning hour,
      hoping to find her sister-in-law alone, but in this she was disappointed.
      Four visitors were in the drawing-room, three ladies and a man of horsey
      appearance, who talked loudly as he leaned back with his legs crossed, a
      walking-stick held over his knee, his hat on the ground before him. The
      ladies were all apparently middle-aged; one of them had a great quantity
      of astonishingly yellow hair, and the others made up for deficiency in
      that respect with toilets in very striking taste. The subject under
      discussion was a recent murder. The gentleman had the happiness of being
      personally acquainted with the murderer, at all events had frequently met
      him at certain resorts of the male population. When Mrs. Rodman had
      briefly welcomed Adela, the discussion continued. Its tone was vulgar, but
      perhaps not more so than the average tone among middle-class people who
      are on familiar terms with each other. The gentleman, still leading the
      conversation, kept his eyes fixed on Adela, greatly to her discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less than half an hour these four took their departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So Dick came a cropper!&rsquo; was Alice&rsquo;s first remark, when alone with her
      sister-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela tried in vain to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At the election, you know. I don&rsquo;t see what he wanted to go making
      himself so ridiculous. Is he much cut up?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it troubles him much,&rsquo; Adela said; &lsquo;he really had no
      expectation of being elected. It was just to draw attention to Socialism.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course he&rsquo;ll put it in that way. But I&rsquo;d no idea you were in London.
      Where are you living?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice had suffered, had suffered distinctly, in her manners, and probably
      in her character. It was not only that she affected a fastness of tone,
      and betrayed an ill-bred pleasure in receiving Adela in her fine
      drawing-room; her face no longer expressed the idle good-nature which used
      to make it pleasant to contemplate, it was thinner, less wholesome in
      colour, rather acid about the lips. Her manner was hurried, she seemed to
      be living in a whirl of frivolous excitements. Her taste in dress had
      deteriorated; she wore a lot of jewellery of a common kind, and her
      headgear was fantastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have a few friends to-morrow night,&rsquo; she said when the conversation
      had with difficulty dragged itself over ten minutes. &lsquo;Will you come to
      dinner? I&rsquo;m sure Willis will be very glad to see you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela heard the invitation with distress. Fortunately it was given in a
      way which all but presupposed refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid I cannot,&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;My health is not good; I never see
      people. Thank you very much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, of course I wouldn&rsquo;t put you out,&rsquo; said Alice, inspecting her
      relative&rsquo;s face curiously. And she added, rather more in her old voice,
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you lost your baby. I believe you&rsquo;re fond of children? I don&rsquo;t
      care anything about them myself; I hope I shan&rsquo;t have any.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela could not make any reply; she shook hands with Alice and took her
      leave, only breathing freely when once more in the street. All the way
      back to St. John&rsquo;s Wood she was afflicted by the thought that it would be
      impossible to advise a meeting between Stella and Mrs. Rodman. Yet she had
      promised Richard to do so. Once more she found herself sundered from him
      in sympathies. Affection between Alice and her there could be none, yet
      Alice was the one person in the world whom Richard held greatly dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enchanted life of those first weeks at Exmouth was now resumed. The
      golden mornings passed with poetry and music; in the afternoon visits were
      paid to museums and galleries, or to the studios of artists who were Mrs.
      Westlake&rsquo;s friends, and who, as Adela was pleased to see, always received
      Stella with reverential homage. The evening, save when a concert called
      them forth, was generally a time of peaceful reading and talking, the
      presence of friends making no difference in the simple arrangements of the
      home. If a man came to dine at this house, it was greatly preferred that
      he should not present himself in the costume of a waiter, and only those
      came who were sufficiently intimate with the Westlakes to know their
      habits. One evening weekly saw a purely Socialist gathering; three or four
      artisans were always among the guests. On that occasion Adela was sorely
      tempted to plead a headache, but for several reasons she resisted. It was
      a trial to her, for she was naturally expected to talk a good deal with
      the visitors, several of whom she herself had entertained at Wanley.
      Watching Stella, she had a feeling which she could not quite explain or
      justify; she was pained to see her goddess in this company, and felt
      indignant with some of the men who seemed to make themselves too much at
      their ease. There was no talk of poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the studios to which Stella took her was that of Mr. Boscobel. Mrs.
      Boscobel made much of them, and insisted on Adela&rsquo;s coming to dine with
      her. An evening was appointed. Adela felt reproofs of conscience,
      remembering the excuse she had offered to Alice, but in this case it was
      impossible to decline. Stella assured her that the party would be small,
      and would be sure to comprise none but really interesting people. It was
      so, in fact. Two men whom, on arriving, they found in the drawing-room
      Adela knew by fame, and the next to enter was a lady whose singing she had
      heard with rapture at a concert on the evening before. She was talking
      with this lady when a new announcement fell upon her ear, a name which
      caused her to start and gaze towards the door. Impossible for her to guard
      against this display of emotion; the name she heard so distinctly seemed
      an unreal utterance, a fancy of her brain, or else it belonged to another
      than the one she knew. But there was no such illusion; he whom she saw
      enter was assuredly Hubert Eldon.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few hot seconds only seemed to intervene before she was called upon to
      acknowledge him, for Mrs. Boscobel was presenting him to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have had the pleasure of meeting Mrs. Mutimer before,&rsquo; Hubert said as
      soon as he saw that Adela in voice and look recognised their acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boscobel was evidently surprised. She herself had met Hubert at the
      house of an artist in Rome more than a year ago, but the details of his
      life were unknown to her. Subsequently, in London, she happened once to
      get on the subject of Socialism with him, and told him, as an interesting
      story, what she heard from the Westlakes about Richard Mutimer. Hubert
      admitted knowledge of the facts, and made the remark about the valley of
      Wanley which Mrs. Boscobel repeated at Exmouth, but he revealed nothing
      more. Having no marriageable daughter, Mrs. Boscobel was under no
      necessity of searching into his antecedents. He was one of ten or a dozen
      young men of possible future whom she liked to have about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert seated himself by Adela, and there was a moment of inevitable
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I saw you as soon as I got into the room,&rsquo; he said, in the desperate
      necessity for speech of some kind. &lsquo;I thought I must have been mistaken; I
      was so unprepared to meet you here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela replied that she was staying with Mrs. Westlake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know her,&rsquo; said Hubert, &lsquo;and am very anxious to Boscobel&rsquo;s
      portrait of her&mdash;I saw it in the studio just before it went away&mdash;was
      a wonderful thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was necessarily said in a low tone; it seemed to establish confidence
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela experienced a sudden and strange calm; in a world so entirely new to
      her, was it not to be expected that things would happen of which she had
      never dreamt? The tremor with which she had faced this her first evening
      in general society had allayed itself almost as soon as she entered the
      room, giving place to a kind of pleasure for which she was not at all
      prepared, a pleasure inconsistent with the mood which governed her life.
      Perhaps, had she been brought into this world in those sunny days before
      her marriage, just such pleasure as this, only in a more pronounced
      degree, would have awoke in her and have been fearlessly indulged. The
      first shock of the meeting with Hubert having passed, she was surprised at
      her self-control, at the ease with which she found she could converse.
      Hubert took her down to dinner; on the stairs he twice turned to look at
      her face, yet she felt sure that her hand had betrayed no agitation as it
      lay on his arm. At table he talked freely; did he know&mdash;she asked
      herself&mdash;that this would relieve her? And his conversation was
      altogether unlike what it had been two years and a half ago&mdash;so long
      it was since she had talked with him under ordinary conditions. There was
      still animation, and the note of intellectual impatience was touched
      occasionally, but the world had ripened him, his judgments were based on
      sounder knowledge, he was more polished, more considerate&mdash;&lsquo;gentler,&rsquo; 
      Adela afterwards said to herself. And decidedly he had gained in personal
      appearance; a good deal of the bright, eager boy had remained with him in
      his days of storm and stress, but now his features had the repose of
      maturity and their refinement had fixed itself in lines of strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked solely of the present, discussed with her the season&rsquo;s pictures,
      the books, the idle business of the town. At length she found herself able
      to meet his glance without fear, even to try and read its character. She
      thought of the day when her mother told her of his wickedness. Since then
      she had made acquaintance with wickedness in various forms, and now she
      marvelled at the way in which she had regarded him. &lsquo;I was a child, a
      child,&rsquo; she repeated to herself. Thinking thus, she lost none of his
      words. He spoke of the things which interested her most deeply; how much
      he could teach her, were such teaching possible!
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she ventured upon a personal question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is Mrs. Eldon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought he looked at her gratefully; certainly there was a deep
      kindness in his eyes, a look which was one of the new things she noted in
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very much as when you knew her,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;Weaker, I fear. I have just
      spent a few days at Agworth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless he had often been at Agworth; perchance he was there, so close
      by, in some of the worst hours of her misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the ladies withdrew Mrs. Boscobel seated herself by Adela for a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you really knew Mr. Eldon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but it is some time since I saw him,&rsquo; Adela replied simply, smiling
      in the joy of being so entirely mistress of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were talking pictures, I heard. You can trust him there; his
      criticism is admirable. You know he did the Grosvenor for the&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She mentioned a weekly paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are so many things I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; Adela replied laughingly, &lsquo;and
      that is one of them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert shortly after had his wish in being presented to Mrs. Westlake.
      Adela observed them as they talked together. Gladness she could hardly
      bear possessed her when she saw on Stella&rsquo;s face the expression of
      interest which not everyone could call forth. She did not ask why she was
      so glad; for this one evening it might be allowed her to rest and forget
      and enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was singing, and the sweetest of the songs went home with her and
      lived in her heart all through a night which was too voiceful for sleep.
      Might she think of him henceforth as a friend? Would she meet him again
      before her return to&mdash;to the darkness of that ravaged valley? Her
      mood was a strange one; conscience gave her no trouble, appeared
      suspended. And why should conscience have interfered with her? Her
      happiness was as apart from past and future as if by some magic she had
      been granted an intermezzo of life wholly distinct from her real one.
      These people with whom she found living so pleasant did not really enter
      her existence; it was as though she played parts to give her pleasure; she
      merely looked on for the permitted hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Stella was real, real as that glorious star whose name she knew not,
      the brightest she could see from her chamber window. To Stella her soul
      clung with passion and worship. Stella&rsquo;s kiss had power to make her all
      but faint with ecstasy; it was the kiss which woke her from her dream, the
      kiss which would for ever be to her a terror and a mystery.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Her waking after a short morning sleep was dark and troubled. The taste of
      last night&rsquo;s happiness was like ashes on her tongue; fearing to face the
      daylight, she lay with lids heavily closed on a brain which ached in its
      endeavour to resume the sensations of a few hours ago. The images of those
      with whom she had talked so cheerfully either eluded her memory, or
      flitted before her unexpectedly, mopping and mowing, so that her heart was
      revolted. It is in wakings such as these that Time finds his opportunity
      to harry youth; every such unwinds from about us one of the veils of
      illusion, bringing our eyes so much nearer to the horrid truth of things.
      Adela shrank from the need of rising; she would have abandoned herself to
      voiceless desolation, have lain still and dark whilst the current of
      misery swept over her, deeper and deeper. When she viewed her face, its
      ring-eyed pallor fascinated her with incredulity. Had she looked at all
      like that whilst Hubert Eldon and the others were talking to her? What did
      they secretly think of her? The others might attribute to her many more
      years than she had really seen; but Hubert knew her age. Perhaps that was
      why he glanced at her twice or thrice on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time she wished not to be alone with Stella, fearing lest
      the conversation should turn on Hubert. Yet, when they had sat together
      for nearly an hour, and Stella had not named him, she began to suffer from
      a besieging desire to speak of him, a recurrent impulse to allude to him,
      however distantly, so that her companion might be led to the subject. The
      impulse grew to a torment, more intolerable each time she resisted it. And
      at last she found herself uttering the name involuntarily, overcome by
      something stronger than her dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was surprised to meet Mr. Eldon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you know him?&rsquo; Stella asked simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He used to live at Wanley Manor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Stella seemed to revive memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that was how I knew the name. Mr. Westlake told me of him, at the
      time when the Manor passed to Mr. Mutimer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband was from home, so had not been at the Boscobels&rsquo; last evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela could rest now that she had spoken. She was searching for a means of
      leading the conversation into another channel, when Stella continued,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You knew him formerly?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, when he still lived at Wanley. I have not met him since he went
      away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Stella mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose he came to live in London?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I understood so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Adela succeeded in speaking of something else. Mental excitement
      had set her blood flowing more quickly, as though an obstruction were
      removed. Before long the unreasoning lightness of heart began to take
      possession of her again. It was strangely painful. To one whom suffering
      has driven upon self-study the predominance of a mere mood is always more
      or less a troublesome mystery; in Adela&rsquo;s case it was becoming a source of
      fear. She seemed to be losing self-control; in looking back on last
      evening she doubted whether her own will had been at all operative in the
      state of calm enjoyment to which she had attained. Was it physical
      weakness which put her thus at the mercy of the moment&rsquo;s influences?
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a letter from Mutimer to-day; in it he mentioned Alice and
      reminded Adela of her promise. This revived a trouble which had fallen out
      of activity for a day or two. She could not come to any decision. When at
      Alice&rsquo;s house she had not even suggested a return visit; at the moment it
      had seemed so out of the question for Alice to meet Mrs. Westlake. In any
      case, was it worth while exposing Stella to the difficulties of such a
      meeting when it could not possibly lead to anything further? One reason
      against it Adela was ashamed to dwell upon, yet it weighed strongly with
      her: she was so jealous of her friend&rsquo;s love, so fearful of losing
      anything in Stella&rsquo;s estimation, that she shrank from the danger of
      becoming associated with Mrs. Rodman in Stella&rsquo;s mind. Could she speak
      freely of Alice? Mutimer&rsquo;s affectionate solicitude was honourable to him,
      and might veil much that was disagreeable in Alice. But the intimacy
      between Adela and Mrs. Westlake was not yet of the kind which permits a
      free disclosure of troubles to which, rightly or wrongly, there attaches a
      sense of shame. Such troubles are always the last to be spoken of between
      friends; friendship must be indeed far-reaching before it includes them
      within its scope. They were still but learning to know each other, and
      that more from silent observation, from the sympathy of looks, from
      touchings of hands and lips, than by means of direct examination or
      avowal. The more she strove with her difficulty the less able Adela felt
      herself to ask Mrs. Rodman to come or to mention her to Stella. The
      trouble spoilt her enjoyment of a concert that evening, and kept her
      restless in the night, for, though seemingly a small matter, it had vital
      connection with the core of her life&rsquo;s problem; it forced her relentlessly
      to a consciousness of many things from which she had taught herself to
      avert her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing there was which caused her anxious debate&mdash;a project
      which had been in her mind for nearly a year. You will not imagine that
      Adela had forgotten the letter from Mrs. Clay. The knowledge it brought
      her made the turning-point of her life. No word on the subject passed
      between her and Mutimer after the conversation which ended in her
      fainting-fit. The letter he retained, and the course he had chosen made it
      advisable that he should pay no heed to its request for assistance. Adela
      remembered the address of the writer, and made a note of it, but it was
      impossible to reply. Her state of mind after overhearing the conversation
      between Richard and his sister was such that she durst not even take the
      step of privately sending money, lest her husband should hear of it and it
      should lead to further question. She felt that, hard as it was to live
      with that secret, to hear Mutimer repeat his calumnies would involve her
      in yet worse anguish, leading perhaps to terrible things; for, on her
      return to the house that night, she suffered a revelation of herself,
      which held her almost mute for the following days. In her heart there
      fought passions of which she had not known herself capable; above all a
      scorn so fierce, that had she but opened her lips it must have uttered
      itself. That she lived down by the aid of many strange expedients; but she
      formed a purpose, which seemed indeed nothing less than a duty, to use the
      opportunity of her first visit to London to seek for means of helping Emma
      Vine and her sister. Her long illness had not weakened this resolve; but
      now that she was in London the difficulties of carrying it out proved
      insuperable. She had always imagined herself procuring the services of
      some agent, but what agent was at hand? She might go herself to the
      address she had noted, but it was to incur a danger too great even for the
      end in view. If Mutimer heard of such a visit&mdash;and she had no means
      of assuring herself that communication between him and those people did
      not still exist&mdash;how would it affect him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela&rsquo;s position would not suffer the risk of ever so slight a difference
      between herself and her husband. She had come to fear him, and now there
      was growing in her a yet graver fear of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The condition of her health favoured remissness and postponement. An hour
      of mental agitation left her with headache and a sense of bodily
      feebleness. Emma Vine she felt in the end obliged to dismiss from her
      thoughts; the difficulty concerning Alice she put off from day to day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second week of her visit was just ending, and the return to Wanley was
      in view, when, on entering the drawing-room in the afternoon, she found
      Hubert Eldon sitting there with Mrs. Westlake. If it had been possible to
      draw back her foot and escape unnoticed! But she was observed; Hubert had
      already risen. Adela fancied that Stella was closely observing her; it was
      not so in reality, but the persuasion wrung her heart to courage. Hubert,
      who did make narrow observance of her face, was struck with the cold
      dignity of her smile. In speaking to him she was much less friendly than
      at the Boscobels&rsquo;. He thought he understood, and was in a measure right. A
      casual meeting in the world was one thing; a visit which might be supposed
      half intended to herself called for another demeanour. He addressed a few
      remarks to her, then pursued his conversation with Mrs. Westlake. Adela
      had time to consider his way of speaking; it was entirely natural, that of
      a polished man who has the habit of society, and takes pleasure in it.
      With utter inconsistency she felt pain that he could be so at his ease in
      her presence. In all likelihood he had come with no other end save that of
      continuing his acquaintance with Mrs. Westlake. As she listened to his
      voice, once more an inexplicable and uncontrollable mood possessed her&mdash;a
      mood of petulance, of impatience with him and with herself; with him for
      almost ignoring her presence, with herself for the distant way in which
      she had met him. An insensate rebellion against circumstances encouraged
      her to feel hurt; by a mystery of the mind intervening time was cancelled,
      and it seemed unnatural, hard to bear, that Hubert should by preference
      address another than herself. An impulse similar to that which had forced
      her to speak his name in conversation with Stella now constrained her to
      break silence, to say something which would require a reply. Her feeling
      became a sort of self-pity; he regarded her as beneath his notice, he
      wished her to see that his indifference was absolute; why should he treat
      her so cruelly?
    </p>
    <p>
      She added a few words to a remark Mrs. Westlake made, and, the moment she
      had spoken, was sensible that her tone had been strangely impulsive.
      Stella glanced at her. Hubert, too, turned his eyes, smiled, and made some
      reply; she had no understanding of what he said. Had not force failed her
      she would have risen and left the room. Her heart sank in yet crueller
      humiliation; she believed there were tears in her eyes, yet had no power
      to check them. He was still addressing Mrs. Westlake; herself he deemed
      incapable of appreciating what he said. Perhaps he even&mdash;the thought
      made clanging in her ears, like a rude bell&mdash;perhaps he even regarded
      her as a social inferior since her marriage. It was almost hysteria, to
      such a pitch of unreason was she wrought. Her second self looked on,
      anguished, helpless. The voices in the room grew distant and confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the door was opened and the servant announced&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Mutimer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It saved her. She saw her husband enter, and an ice-cold breath made
      frigid her throbbing veins. She fixed her eyes upon him, and could not
      remove them; they followed him from the door to where Stella stood to
      receive him. She saw that he almost paused on recognising Eldon, that his
      brows contracted, that involuntarily he looked at <i>her</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know Mr. Eldon,&rsquo; Stella said, perhaps in not quite her ordinary
      voice, for the meeting could in no case be a very happy one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes,&rsquo; replied Mutimer, scarcely looking at Hubert, and making an idle
      effort at a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert did not reseat himself. He took leave of Stella cordially; to Adela
      he inclined himself at respectful distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westlake supplied conversation. Adela, leaving her former chair, took
      a seat by her friend&rsquo;s side, but could not as yet trust her voice.
      Presently her husband addressed her; it was for the first time; he had not
      even given his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alice is very anxious that you should dine with her before you go home.
      Do you think Mrs. Westlake could spare you this evening?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And, on Stella&rsquo;s looking an inquiry, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My sister, Mrs. Rodman. I don&rsquo;t think you know her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela had no choice but to procure her hostess&rsquo;s assent to this
      arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll call for you at seven o&rsquo;clock,&rsquo; Mutimer said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela knew that he was commanding himself; his tone was not quite
      discourteous, but he had none of the genial satisfaction which he
      ordinarily showed in the company of refined people. She attributed his
      displeasure to her neglect of Alice. But it did not affect her as it had
      been wont to; she was disposed to resent it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time between his departure and seven o&rsquo;clock she spent by herself,
      unoccupied, sitting as if tired. She put off the necessary changing of
      garments till there was scarcely time for it. When at length she was
      summoned she went down with flushed face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feel as if I were going to have a fever,&rsquo; she said to Stella in the
      drawing-room. She could not help uttering the words, but laughed
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your hand is really very hot,&rsquo; Stella replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer had a cab at the door, and was waiting in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a long time,&rsquo; was his greeting, with more impatience than he had
      ever used to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were together in the hansom:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did you refuse Alice&rsquo;s invitation before?&rsquo; he asked with displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t think she really wished me to accept it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke without misgiving, still resenting his manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t think? Why, what do you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t ask her to call, either?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ought to have done so. I am very sorry to have neglected it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with surprise which was very like a sneer, and kept
      silence till they reached the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the ladies whom Adela had already met, and a gentleman styled
      Captain something, were guests at dinner. Alice received her sister-in-law
      with evident pleasure, though not perhaps that of pure hospitableness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do hope it won&rsquo;t be too much for you,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Pray leave as soon as
      you feel you ought to. I should never forgive myself if you took a cold or
      anything of the kind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Really, Alice had supplied herself with most becoming phrases. The novels
      had done much; and then she had been living in society. At dinner she
      laughed rather too loud, it might be, and was too much given to addressing
      her husband as &lsquo;Willis;&rsquo; but her undeniable prettiness in low-necked
      evening dress condoned what was amiss in manner. Mr. Rodman looked too
      gentlemanly; he reminded one of a hero of polite melodrama on the
      English-French stage. The Captain talked stock-exchange, and was
      continually inquiring about some one or other, &lsquo;Did he drop much?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer was staying at the house over-night. After dinner he spoke aside
      with Adela.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose you go back to-morrow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I meant to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We may as well go together, then. I&rsquo;ll call for you at two o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He considered, and changed the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ll come at ten. I want you to go with me to buy some things. Then
      we&rsquo;ll have lunch here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And go back for my luggage?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll take it away at ten o&rsquo;clock and leave it at the station. I suppose
      you can be ready?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I can be ready,&rsquo; Adela answered mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drove back with her to Avenue Road in the Rodmans&rsquo; carriage, and left
      her at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Westlake was expected home to-night, but had telegraphed to say that
      he would return in the morning. Stella had spent the evening alone; Adela
      found her in the boudoir with a single lamp, reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you still feverish?&rsquo; Stella asked, putting to her cheek the ungloved
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think not&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Stella waited to hear something about the evening, but Adela broke the
      silence to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must leave at ten in the morning. My husband will call for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So early?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you come and see me before long, Stella?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will,&rsquo; was the gentle reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you. I shall look forward to it very much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Adela said good-night, speaking more cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her bedroom she sat as before dinner. The fever had subsided during the
      past two hours, but now it crept into her blood again, insidious,
      tingling. And with it came so black a phantom of despair that Adela closed
      her eyes shudderingly, lay back as one lifeless, and wished that it were
      possible by the will alone to yield the breath and cease. The night pulsed
      about her, beat regularly like a great clock, and its pulsing smote upon
      her brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-morrow she must follow her husband, who would come to lead her home.
      Home? what home had she? What home would she ever have but a grave in the
      grassy churchyard of Wanley? Why did death spare her when it took the life
      which panted but for a moment on her bosom?
    </p>
    <p>
      She must leave Stella and go back to her duties at the Manor; must teach
      the children of New Wanley; must love, honour, obey her husband. Returning
      from Exmouth, she was glad to see her house again; now she had rather a
      thousand times die than go back. Horror shook her like a palsy; all that
      she had borne for eighteen months seemed accumulated upon her now, waited
      for her there at Wanley to be endured again. Oh! where was the maiden
      whiteness of her soul? What malignant fate had robbed her for ever of
      innocence and peace?
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this fever or madness? She rose and flung her arms against a hideous
      form which was about to seize her. It would not vanish, it pressed upon
      her. She cried, fled to the door, escaped, and called Stella&rsquo;s name aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      A door near her own opened, and Stella appeared. Adela clung to her, and
      was drawn into the room. Those eyes of infinite pity gazing into her own
      availed to calm her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I send for some one?&rsquo; Stella asked anxiously, but with no weak
      bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; it is not illness. But I dread to be alone; I am nervous.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you stay with me, dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Stella, let me, let me! I want to be near to you whilst I may!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Stella&rsquo;s child slept peacefully in a crib; the voices were too low to wake
      it. Almost like another child, Adela allowed herself to be undressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I leave a light?&rsquo; Stella asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I can sleep. Only let me feel your arms.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They lay in unbroken silence till both slept.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a character such as Mutimer&rsquo;s there will almost certainly be found a
      disposition to cruelty, for strong instincts of domination, even of the
      nobler kind, only wait for circumstances to develop crude tyranny&mdash;the
      cruder, of course, in proportion to the lack of native or acquired
      refinement which distinguishes the man. We had a hint of such things in
      Mutimer&rsquo;s progressive feeling with regard to Emma Vine. The possibility of
      his becoming a tyrannous husband could not be doubted by any one who
      viewed him closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      There needed only the occasion, and this at length presented itself in the
      form of jealousy. Of all possible incentives it was the one most
      calamitous, for it came just when a slow and secret growth of passion was
      making demand for room and air. Mutimer had for some time been at a loss
      to understand his own sensations; he knew that his wife was becoming more
      and more a necessity to him, and that too when the progress of time would
      have led him to expect the very opposite. He knew it during her absence at
      Exmouth, more still now that she was away in London. It was with
      reluctance that he let her leave home, only his satisfaction in her
      intimacy with the Westlakes and his hopes for Alice induced him to
      acquiesce in her departure. Yet he could show nothing of this. A lack of
      self-confidence, a strange shyness, embarrassed him as often as he would
      give play to his feelings. They were intensified by suppression, and
      goaded him to constant restlessness. When at most a day or two remained
      before Adela&rsquo;s return, he could no longer resist the desire to surprise
      her in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only did he find her in the company of the man whom he had formerly
      feared as a rival, but her behaviour seemed to him distinctly to betray
      consternation at his arrival. She was colourless, agitated, could not
      speak. From that moment his love was of the quality which in its
      manifestations is often indistinguishable from hatred. He resolved to keep
      her under his eye, to enforce to the uttermost his marital authority, to
      make her pay bitterly for the freedom she had stolen. His exasperated
      egoism flew at once to the extreme of suspicion; he was ready to accuse
      her of completed perfidy. Mrs. Westlake became his enemy; the profound
      distrust of culture, which was inseparable from his mental narrowness,
      however ambition might lead him to disguise it, seized upon the occasion
      to declare itself; that woman was capable of conniving at his dishonour,
      even of plotting it. He would not allow Adela to remain in the house a
      minute longer than he could help. Even the casual absence of Mr. Westlake
      became a suspicious circumstance; Eldon of course chose the time for his
      visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela was once more safe in the Manor, under lock and key, as it were. He
      had not spoken of Eldon, though several times on the point of doing so. It
      was obvious that the return home cost her suffering, that it was making
      her ill. He could not get her to converse; he saw that she did not study.
      It was impossible to keep watch on her at all moments of the day; yet how
      otherwise discover what letters she wrote or received? He pondered the
      practicability of bribing her maid to act as a spy upon her, but feared to
      attempt it. He found opportunities of secretly examining the blotter on
      her writing-desk, and it convinced him that she had written to Mrs.
      Westlake. It maddened him that he had not the courage to take a single
      open step, to forbid, for instance, all future correspondence with London.
      To do so would be to declare his suspicions. He wished to declare them; it
      would have gratified him intensely to vomit impeachments, to terrify her
      with coarseness and violence; but, on the other hand, by keeping quiet he
      might surprise positive evidence, and if only he did!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was ill; he had a distinct pleasure in observing it. She longed for
      quiet and retirement; he neglected his business to force his company upon
      her, to laugh and talk loudly. She with difficulty read a page; he made
      her read aloud to him by the hour, or write translations for him from
      French and German. The pale anguish of her face was his joy; it fascinated
      him, fired his senses, made him a demon of vicious cruelty. Yet he durst
      not as much as touch her hand when she sat before him. Her purity, which
      was her safeguard, stirred his venom; he worshipped it, and would have
      smothered it in foulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better have the doctor to see you?&rsquo; he began one morning when
      he had followed her from the dining-room to her boudoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The doctor? Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t seem up to the mark,&rsquo; he replied, avoiding her look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela kept silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were well enough in London, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am never very strong.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you might be a bit more cheerful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will try to be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This submission always aggravated his disease&mdash;by what other name to
      call it? He would have had her resist him, that he might know the pleasure
      of crushing her will.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked about the room, then suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is that man Eldon doing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela looked at him with surprise. It had never entered her thoughts that
      the meeting with Eldon would cost him more than a passing annoyance&mdash;she
      knew he disliked him&mdash;and least of all that such annoyance would in
      any way be connected with herself. It was possible, of course, that some
      idle tongue had gossiped of her former friendship with Hubert, but there
      was no one save Letty who knew what her feelings really had been, and was
      not the fact of her marriage enough to remove any suspicion that Mutimer
      might formerly have entertained? But the manner of his question was so
      singular, the introduction of Eldon&rsquo;s name so abrupt, that she could not
      but discern in a measure what was in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. Do you mean how is he engaged?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How comes he to know Mrs. Westlake?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Through common friends&mdash;some people named Boscobel. Mr. Boscobel is
      an artist, and Mr. Eldon appears to be studying art.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was quite steady through this explanation. The surprise seemed
      to have enabled her to regard him unmoved, almost with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s constantly there&mdash;at the Westlakes&rsquo;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was his first visit. We met him a few evenings before at the
      Boscobels&rsquo;, at dinner. It was then he made Mrs. Westlake&rsquo;s acquaintance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer moved his head as if to signify indifference. But Adela had found
      an unexpected relief in speaking thus openly; she was tempted to go
      further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe he writes about pictures. Mrs. Boscobel told me that he had
      been some time in Italy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well and good; I don&rsquo;t care to hear about his affairs. So you dined with
      these Boscobel people?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled disagreeably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought you were rather particular about telling the truth. You told
      Alice you never dined out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I said that,&rsquo; Adela replied quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused; then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What fault have you to find with Alice, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela was not in the mood for evasions; she answered in much the same tone
      as she had used in speaking of Hubert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think she likes me. If she did, I should be able to be more
      friendly with her. Her world is very different from ours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Different? You mean you don&rsquo;t like Rodman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was not thinking of Mr. Rodman. I mean that her friends are not the
      same as ours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer forgot for a moment his preoccupation in thought of Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was there anything wrong with the people you met there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just tell me what you think. I want to know. What did you object to?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think they were the best kind of people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The best kind? I suppose they are what you call ladies and gentlemen?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must have felt that they were not quite the same as the Westlakes,
      for instance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Westlakes!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He named them sneeringly, to Adela&rsquo;s astonishment. And he added as he
      walked towards the door:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There isn&rsquo;t much to be said for some of the people you meet there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A new complexity was introduced into her life. Viewed by this recent
      light, Mutimer&rsquo;s behaviour since the return from London was not so
      difficult to understand; but the problem of how to bear with it became the
      harder. There were hours when Adela&rsquo;s soul was like a bird of the woods
      cage-pent: it dashed itself against the bars of fate, and in anguish
      conceived the most desperate attempts for freedom. She could always die,
      but was it not hard to perish in her youth and with the world&rsquo;s cup of
      bliss untasted? Flight? Ah! whither could she flee? The thought of the
      misery she would leave behind her, the disgrace that would fall upon her
      mother&mdash;this would alone make flight impossible. Yet could she
      conceive life such as this prolonging itself into the hopeless years,
      renunciation her strength and her reward, duty a grinning skeleton at her
      bedside? It grew harder daily. More than a year ago she thought that the
      worst was over, and since then had known the solace of self-forgetful
      idealisms, of ascetic striving. It was all illusion, the spinning of a
      desolate heart. There was no help now, for she knew herself and the world.
      Foolish, foolish child, who with her own hand had flung away the jewel of
      existence like a thing of no price! Her lot appeared single in its
      haplessness. She thought of Stella, of Letty, even of Alice; <i>they</i>
      had not been doomed to learn in suffering. To her, alone of all women,
      knowledge had come with a curse.
    </p>
    <p>
      A month passed. Since Rodman&rsquo;s departure from Wanley, &lsquo;Arry Mutimer was
      living at the Manor. Her husband and &lsquo;Arry were Adela&rsquo;s sole companions;
      the former she dreaded, the approach of the latter always caused her
      insuperable disgust. To Letty there was born a son; Adela could not bend
      to the little one with a whole heart; her own desolate motherhood wailed
      the more bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more a change was coming. Alice and her husband were going to spend
      August at a French watering-place, and Mutimer proposed to join them for a
      fortnight; Adela of course would be of the party. The invitation came from
      Rodman, who had reasons for wishing to get his brother-in-law aside for a
      little quiet talk. Rodman had large views, was at present pondering a
      financial scheme in which he needed a partner&mdash;one with capital of
      course. He knew that New Wanley was proving anything but a prosperous
      concern, commercially speaking; he divined, moreover, that Mutimer was not
      wholly satisfied with the state of affairs. By judicious management the
      Socialist might even be induced to abandon the non-paying enterprise, and,
      though not perhaps ostensibly, embark in one that promised very different
      results&mdash;at all events to Mr. Rodman. The scheme was not of mushroom
      growth; it dated from a time but little posterior to Mr. Rodman&rsquo;s first
      meeting with Alice Mutimer. &lsquo;Arry had been granted appetising sniffs at
      the cookery in progress, though the youth was naturally left without
      precise information as to the ingredients. The result was a surprising
      self-restraint on &lsquo;Arry&rsquo;s part. The influence which poor Keene had so
      bunglingly tried to obtain over him, the more astute Mr. Rodman had
      compassed without difficulty; beginning with the loan of small sums, to be
      repaid when &lsquo;Arry attained his majority, he little by little made the
      prospective man of capital the creature of his directions; in something
      less than two more years Rodman looked to find ample recompense for his
      expenditure and trouble. But that was a mere parergon; to secure Richard
      Mutimer was the great end steadily held in view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodman and his wife came to Wanley to spend three days before all together
      set out for the Continent. Adela accepted the course of things, and
      abandoned herself to the stream. For a week her husband had been milder;
      we know the instinct that draws the cat&rsquo;s paws from the flagging mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice, no longer much interested in novels, must needs talk with some one;
      she honoured Adela with much of her confidence, seeming to forget and
      forgive, in reality delighted to recount her London experiences to her
      poor tame sister-in-law. Alice, too, had been at moments introduced to her
      husband&rsquo;s kitchen; she threw out vague hints of a wonderful repast in
      preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Willis is going to buy me a house in Brighton,&rsquo; she said, among other
      things. &lsquo;I shall run down whenever I feel it would do me good. You&rsquo;ve no
      idea how kind he is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, in fact, an &lsquo;advancement clause&rsquo; in Alice&rsquo;s deed of settlement.
      If Mr. Rodman showed himself particularly anxious to cultivate the
      friendship of Mr. Alfred Waltham, possibly one might look for the
      explanation to the terms of that same document.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a Sunday morning. Preparations for departure on the morrow were
      practically completed. The weather was delightful. Adela finished
      breakfast in time to wander a little about the garden before it was the
      hour for church; her husband and Rodman breakfasted with her, and went to
      smoke in the library. Alice and &lsquo;Arry did not present themselves till the
      church bells had ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela was glad to be alone in the dusky pew. She was the first of the
      congregation to arrive, and she sat, as always, with the curtains
      enclosing her save in front. The bells ringing above the roof had a
      soothing effect upon her, and gave strange turns to her thought. So had
      their summoning rung out to generation after generation; so would it ring
      long after she was buried and at rest. Where would her grave be? She was
      going for the first time to a foreign country; perhaps death might come to
      her there. Then she would lie for ever among strangers, and her place be
      forgotten. Would it not be the fitting end of so sad and short a life?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the front of the pew was a cupboard; the upper portion, which contained
      the service books, was closed with a long, narrow door, opening downwards
      on horizontal hinges; the shelf on which the books lay went back into
      darkness, being, perhaps, two feet broad. Below this shelf was the door of
      the lower and much larger receptacle; it slid longitudinally, and revealed
      a couple of buffets, kept here to supplement the number in the pew when
      necessary. Adela had only once opened the sliding door, and then merely to
      glance into the dark hollows and close it again. Probably the buffets had
      lain undisturbed for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering the pew this morning she had as usual dropped the upper door,
      and had laid her large church service open on the shelf, where she could
      reach it as soon as Mr. Wyvern began to read. Then began her reverie. From
      thoughts of the grave she passed to memories of her wedding-day. How often
      the scene of that morning had re-enacted itself in her mind! Often she
      dreamed it all over, and woke as from a nightmare. She wished it had not
      taken place in this church; it troubled the sacred recollections of her
      maiden peace. She began to think it over once more, attracted by the pain
      it caused her, and, on coming to the bestowal of the ring, an odd caprice
      led her to draw the circlet itself from her finger. When she had done it
      she trembled. The hand looked so strange. Oh, her hand, her hand! Once
      ringless indeed, once her own to give, to stretch forth in pledge of the
      heart&rsquo;s imperishable faith! Now a prisoner for ever; but, thus ringless,
      so like a maiden hand once more. There came a foolish sense of ease. She
      would keep her finger free yet a little, perhaps through the service. She
      bent forward and laid the ring on the open book.
    </p>
    <p>
      More dreams, quite other than before; then the organ began its prelude, a
      tremor passing through the church before the sound broke forth. Adela sank
      deeper in reverie. At length Mr. Wyvern&rsquo;s voice roused her; she stood up
      and reached her book; but she had wholly forgotten that the ring lay upon
      it, and was only reminded by a glimpse of it rolling away on the shelf,
      rolling to the back of the cupboard. But it did not stop there; surely it
      was the ring that she heard fall down below, behind the large sliding
      door. She had a sudden fright lest it should be lost, and stooped at once
      to search for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew back the door, pushed aside the buffets, then groped in the
      darkness. She touched the ring. But something else lay there; it seemed a
      long piece of thick paper, folded. This too she brought forth, and, having
      slipped the ring on her finger, looked to see what she had found.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was parchment She unfolded it, and saw that it was covered with writing
      in a clerkly hand. How strange!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is the last will and testament of me, RICHMOND MUTIMER&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hand shook. She felt as if the sides of the pew were circling about
      her, as if she stood amid falling and changing things.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked to the foot of the sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In witness whereof I, the said Richard Mutimer, have hereunto set my hand
      this seventeenth day of October, 187-.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The date was some six months prior to old Richard Mutimer&rsquo;s death. This
      could be nothing but the will which every one believed him to have
      destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela sank upon the seat. Her ring! Had she picked it up? Yes; it was
      again upon her finger. How had it chanced to fall down below? She rose
      again and examined the cupboard; there was a gap of four or five inches at
      the back of the upper shelf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the will fallen in the same way? Adela conjectured that thus it had
      been lost, though when or under what circumstances she could not imagine.
      We, who are calmer, may conceive the old man to have taken his will to
      church with him on the morning of his death, he being then greatly
      troubled about the changes he had in view. Perhaps he laid the folded
      parchment on the shelf and rested one of the large books in front of it.
      He breathed his last. Then the old woman, whose duty it was to put the
      pews in order, hurriedly throwing the books into the cupboard as soon as
      the dead man was removed, perchance pushed the document so far back that
      it slipped through the gap and down behind the buffets.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all events, no one has ever hit upon a likelier explanation.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      She could not sit through the service, yet to leave the church she would
      have to walk the whole length of the aisle. What did it matter? It would
      very soon be known why she had gone away, and to face for a moment the
      wonder of Sunday-clad villagers is not a grave trial. Adela opened the pew
      door and quitted the church, the parchment held beneath her mantle.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she issued from the porch the sun smote warm upon her face; it
      encouraged a feeling of gladness which had followed her astonishment. She
      had discovered the tenor of the will; it affected her with a sudden joy,
      undisturbed at first by any reflection. The thought of self was slow in
      coming, and had not power to trouble her greatly even when she faced it.
      Befall herself what might, she held against her heart a power which was
      the utmost limit of that heart&rsquo;s desire. So vast, so undreamt, so
      mysteriously given to her, that it seemed preternatural. Her weakness was
      become strength; with a single word she could work changes such as it had
      seemed no human agency could bring about.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her, to her it had been given! What was all her suffering, crowned with
      power like this?
    </p>
    <p>
      She durst not take the will from beneath her mantle, though burning to
      reassure herself of its contents. Not till she was locked in her room. If
      any one met her as she entered the house, her excuse would be that she did
      not feel well.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as she hurried toward the Manor, she all at once found herself face to
      face with her brother. Alfred was having a ramble, rather glad to get out
      of hearing of the baby this Sunday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo, what&rsquo;s up?&rsquo; was his exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela feared lest her face had betrayed her. She was conscious that her
      look could not be that of illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am obliged to go home,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I have forgotten something.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should have thought you&rsquo;d rather have let the house burn down than
      scutter away in this profane fashion. All right, I won&rsquo;t stop you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, tempted to give some hint. But before she could speak,
      Alfred continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So Mutimer&rsquo;s going to throw it up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; she asked in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded towards New Wanley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Throw it up?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I understand. Don&rsquo;t mention that I said anything; I supposed you
      knew.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knew nothing. You mean that he is going to abandon the works?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something of the kind, I fancy. I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s decided, but that
      fellow Rodman&mdash;well, time enough to talk about it. It&rsquo;s a pity,
      that&rsquo;s all I can say. Still, if he&rsquo;s really losing&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Losing? But he never expected to make money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, but I fancy he&rsquo;s beginning to see things in a different light. I tell
      you what it is, Adela; I can&rsquo;t stand that fellow Rodman. I&rsquo;ve got an idea
      he&rsquo;s up to something. Don&rsquo;t let him lead Mutimer by the nose, that&rsquo;s all.
      But this isn&rsquo;t Sunday talk. Youngster rather obstreperous this morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela had no desire to question further: she let her brother pass on, and
      continued her own walk at a more moderate pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred&rsquo;s words put her in mind of considerations to which in her
      excitement she had given no thought. New Wanley was no longer her
      husband&rsquo;s property, and the great Socialist undertaking must come to an
      end. In spite of her personal feeling, she could not view with
      indifference the failure of an attempt which she had trained herself to
      regard as nobly planned, and full of importance to the world at large.
      Though she no longer saw Mutimer&rsquo;s character in the same light as when
      first she bent her nature to his direction, she still would have
      attributed to him a higher grief than the merely self-regarding; she had
      never suspected him of insincerity in his public zeal. Mutimer had been
      scrupulous to avoid any utterance which might betray half-heartedness; in
      his sullen fits of late he had even made it a reproach against her that
      she cared little for his own deepest interests. To his wife last of all he
      would have confessed a failing in his enthusiasm: jealousy had made him
      discourteous, had lowered the tone of his intercourse with her; but to
      figure as a hero in her eyes was no less, nay more, than ever a leading
      motive in his life. But if what Alfred said was true, Adela saw that in
      this also she had deceived herself: the man whose very heart was in a
      great cause would sacrifice everything, and fight on to the uttermost
      verge of hope. There was no longer room for regret on his account.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the Manor gates she feared to walk straight up to the house;
      she felt that, if she met her husband, she could not command her face, and
      her tongue would falter. She took a path which led round to the gardens in
      the rear. She had remembered a little summer-house which stood beyond the
      kitchen-garden, in a spot sure to be solitary at this hour. There she
      could read the will attentively, and fix her resolution before entering
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trees and bushes screened her. She neared the summerhouse, and was at the
      very door before she perceived that it was occupied. There sat &lsquo;Arry and a
      kitchenmaid, very close to each other, chatting confidentially. &lsquo;Arry
      looked up, and something as near a blush as he was capable of came to his
      face. The kitchen damsel followed the direction of his eyes, and was
      terror-stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela hastened away. An unspeakable loathing turned her heart. She
      scarcely wondered, but pressed the parchment closer, and joyed in the
      thought that she would so soon be free of this tainted air.
    </p>
    <p>
      She no longer hesitated to enter, and was fortunate enough to reach her
      room without meeting any one. She locked the door, then unfolded the will
      and began to peruse it with care.
    </p>
    <p>
      The testator devised the whole of his real estate to Hubert Eldon; to
      Hubert also he bequeathed his personal property, subject to certain
      charges. These were&mdash;first, the payment of a legacy of one thousand
      pounds to Mrs. Eldon; secondly, of a legacy of five hundred pounds to Mr.
      Yottle, the solicitor; thirdly, of an annuity of one hundred and seven
      pounds to the testator&rsquo;s great-nephew, Richard Mutimer, such sum being the
      yearly product of a specified investment. The annuity was to extend to the
      life of Richard&rsquo;s widow, should he leave one; but power was given to the
      trustee to make over to Richard Mutimer, or to his widow, any part or the
      whole of the invested capital, if he felt satisfied that to do so would be
      for the annuitant&rsquo;s benefit. &lsquo;It is not my wish&rsquo;&mdash;these words
      followed the directions&mdash;&lsquo;to put the said Richard Mutimer above the
      need of supporting himself by honest work, but only to aid him to make use
      of the abilities which I understand he possesses, and to become a credit
      to the class to which he belongs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The executors were Hubert Eldon himself and the lawyer Mr. Yottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man of the world brought face to face with startling revelations of this
      kind naturally turns at once to thought of technicalities, evasions,
      compromises. Adela&rsquo;s simpler mind fixed itself upon the plain sense of the
      will; that meant restitution to the uttermost farthing. For more than two
      years Hubert Eldon had been kept out of his possessions; others had been
      using them, and lavishly. Would it be possible for her husband to restore?
      He must have expended great sums, and of his own he had not a penny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thought for herself came last. Mutimer must abandon Wanley, and whither he
      went, thither must she go also. Their income would be a hundred and seven
      pounds. Her husband became once more a working man. Doubtless he would
      return to London; their home would be a poor one, like that of ordinary
      working folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      How would he bear it? How would he take this from <i>her</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      Fear crept insidiously about her heart, though she fought to banish it. It
      was a fear of the instinct, clinging to trifles in the memory, feeding
      upon tones, glances, the impressions of forgotten moments. She was
      conscious that here at length was the crucial test of her husband&rsquo;s
      nature, and in spite of every generous impulse she dreaded the issue. To
      that dread she durst not abandon herself; to let it grow even for an
      instant cost her a sensation of faintness, a desire to flee for cover to
      those who would naturally protect her. To give up all&mdash;and to Hubert
      Eldon! She recalled his voice when the other day he spoke of Hubert. He
      had not since recurred to the subject, but his manner still bore the
      significance with which that conversation had invested it. No dream of
      suspicions on his part had come to her, but it was enough that something
      had happened to intensify his dislike of Hubert. Of her many fears, here
      was one which couched dark and shapeless in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      A feeble woman would have chosen anyone&mdash;her mother, her brother&mdash;rather
      than Mutimer himself for the first participant in such a discovery. Adela
      was not feeble, and the very danger, though it might chill her senses,
      nerved her soul. Was she not making him too ignoble? Was she not herself
      responsible for much of the strangeness in his behaviour of late? The
      question she had once asked herself, whether he loved her, she could not
      answer doubtfully; was it not his love that had set her icily against him?
      If she could not render him love in return, that was the wrong she did
      him, the sin she had committed in becoming his wife. Adela by this time
      knew too well that, in her threefold vows, love had of right the foremost
      place; honour and obedience could not exist without love. Her wrong was
      involuntary, none the less she owed him such reparation as was possible;
      she must keep her mind open to his better qualities. A man might fall, yet
      not be irredeemably base. Oh, that she had never known of that poor girl
      in London! Base, doubly and trebly base, had been his behaviour there, for
      one ill deed had drawn others after it. But his repentance, his
      humiliation, must have been deep, and of the kind which strengthens
      against ill-doing in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had to be done, and had better be done quickly. Adela went to her
      boudoir and rang the bell. The servant who came told her that Mutimer was
      in the house. She summoned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was five minutes before he appeared. He was preoccupied, though not
      gloomily so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought you were at church,&rsquo; he said, regarding her absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I came away&mdash;because I found something&mdash;this!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had hoped to speak with calmness, but the interval of waiting had
      agitated her, and the fear which no effort could allay struck her heart as
      he entered. She held the parchment to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; he asked, his attention gradually awakened by surprise. He
      did not move forward to meet her extended hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will see&mdash;it is the will that we thought was destroyed&mdash;old
      Mr. Mutimer&rsquo;s will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose and brought it to him. He looked at her with a sceptical smile,
      which was involuntary, and lingered on his face even after he had begun to
      read the document.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela seated herself again; she had scarcely power to stand. There was a
      long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where did you find this?&rsquo; Mutimer inquired at length. His tone astonished
      her; it was almost indifferent. But he did not raise his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She explained. It was needless, she thought, to give a reason for her
      search in the lower cupboard; but the first thing that occurred to Mutimer
      was to demand such reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment&rsquo;s hesitation; then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A piece of money rolled down behind the shelf on which the books are;
      there is a gap at the back. I suppose that is how the will fell down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His eye was now steadily fixed upon her, coldly scrutinising, as one
      regards a suspected stranger. Adela was made wretched by the inevitable
      falsehood. She felt herself reddening under his gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to fall into absent-mindedness, then re-read the document. Then
      he took out his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The people are out of church. Come and show me where it was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With a deep sense of relief she went away to put on her bonnet. To escape
      for a moment was what she needed, and the self-command of his voice seemed
      to assure her against her worst fears. She felt grateful to him for
      preserving his dignity. The future lost one of its terrors if only she
      could respect him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked side by side to the church in silence: Mutimer had put the
      will into his pocket. At the wicket he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will Wyvern be in there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was answered by the appearance of the vicar himself, who just
      then came forth from the front doorway. He approached them, with a hope
      that Adela had not been obliged to leave through indisposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A little faintness,&rsquo; Mutimer was quick to reply. &lsquo;We are going to look
      for something she dropped in the pew.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvern passed on. Only the pew-opener was moving about the aisles. She
      looked with surprise at the pair as they entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell her the same,&rsquo; Mutimer commanded, under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman was of course ready with offers of assistance, but a word
      from Richard sufficed to keep her away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The examination was quickly made, and they returned as they had come,
      without exchanging a word on the way. They went upstairs again to the
      boudoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit down,&rsquo; Mutimer said briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He himself continued to stand, again examining the will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think,&rsquo; he began slowly, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s as likely as not that this is a
      forgery.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A forgery? But who could have&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s not likely to have run the risk himself, I suppose,&rsquo; Mutimer
      pursued, with a quiet sneer, &lsquo;but no doubt there are people who would
      benefit by it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela had an impulse of indignation. It showed intself in her cold, steady
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The will was thick with dust. It has been lying there a long time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course. They wouldn&rsquo;t bungle over an important thing like this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was once more scrutinising her. The suspicion was a genuine one, and
      involved even more than Adela could imagine. If there had been a plot,
      such plot assuredly included the discoverer of the document. Could he in
      his heart charge Adela with that? There were two voices at his ear, and of
      equal persuasiveness. Even to look into her face did not silence the
      calumnious whispering. Her beauty was fuel to his jealousy, and his
      jealousy alone made the supposition of her guilt for a moment tenable. It
      was on his lips to accuse her, to ease himself with savage innuendoes,
      those &lsquo;easy things to understand&rsquo; which come naturally from such a man in
      such a situation. But to do that would be to break with her for ever, and
      the voice that urged her innocence would not let him incur such risk. The
      loss of his possessions was a calamity so great that as yet he could not
      realise its possibility; the loss of his wife impressed his imagination
      more immediately, and was in this moment the more active fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in the strange position of a man who finds all at once that he <i>dare</i>
      not believe that which he has been trying his best to believe. If Adela
      were guilty of plotting with Eldon, it meant that he himself was the
      object of her utter hatred, a hideous thought to entertain. It threw him
      back upon her innocence. Egoism had to do the work of the finer moral
      perceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it rather strange,&rsquo; he said, not this time sneeringly, but seeking
      for support against his intolerable suspicions, &lsquo;that you never moved
      those buffets before?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never had need of them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that hole has never been cleaned out?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never; clearly never.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had risen to her feet, impelled by a glimmering of the thought in
      which he examined her. What she next said came from her without
      premeditation. Her tongue seemed to speak independently of her will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One thing I have said that was not true. It was not money that slipped
      down, but my ring. I had taken it off and laid it on the Prayer-book.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your ring?&rsquo; he repeated, with cold surprise. &lsquo;Do you always take your
      ring off in church, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the words were spoken she had gone deadly pale. Was it well to
      say that? Must there follow yet more explanation? She with difficulty
      overcame an impulse to speak on and disclose all her mind, the same kind
      of impulse she had known several times of late. Sheer dread this time
      prevailed. The eyes that were upon her concealed fire; what madness
      tempted her to provoke its outburst?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have never done so before,&rsquo; she replied confusedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why to-day, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why did you tell&mdash;why did you say it was money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t explain that,&rsquo; she answered, her head bowed. &lsquo;I took off the ring
      thoughtlessly; it is rather loose; my finger is thinner than it used to
      be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On the track of cunning Mutimer&rsquo;s mind was keen enough; only amid the
      complexities of such motives as sway a pure heart in trouble was he quite
      at a loss. This confession of untruthfulness might on the face of it have
      spoken in Adela&rsquo;s favour; but his very understanding of that made him seek
      for subtle treachery. She saw he suspected her; was it not good policy to
      seem perfectly frank, even if such frankness for the moment gave a
      strengthening to suspicion? What devilish ingenuity might after all be
      concealed in this woman, whom he had taken for simplicity itself!
    </p>
    <p>
      The first bell for luncheon disturbed his reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please sit down,&rsquo; he said, pointing to the chair. &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t end our talk
      just yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed him, glad again to rest her trembling limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you suspect it to be a forgery,&rsquo; she said, when she had waited in vain
      for him to speak further, &lsquo;the best way of deciding is to go at once to
      Mr. Yottle. He will remember; it was he drew up the will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He flashed a glance at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly aware of that. If this is forged, the lawyer has of course
      given his help. He would be glad to see me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the suspicion was genuine. Mutimer felt himself hedged in; every
      avenue of escape to which his thoughts turned was closed in advance. There
      was no one he would not now have suspected. The full meaning of his
      position was growing upon him; it made a ferment in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Yottle!&rsquo; Adela exclaimed in astonishment. &lsquo;You think it possible that
      he&mdash;Oh, that is folly!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was folly; her voice assured him of it, proclaiming at the same
      time the folly of his whole doubt. It was falling to pieces, and, as it
      fell, disclosing the image of his fate, inexorable, inconceivable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood for more than five minutes in silence. Then he drew a little
      nearer to her, and asked in an unsteady voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you glad of this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Glad of it?&rsquo; she repeated under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; shall you be glad to see me lose everything?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You cannot wish to keep what belongs to others. In that sense I think we
      ought to be glad that the will is found.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke so coldly that he drew away from her again. The second bell
      rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They had better have lunch without us,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rang and bade the servant ask Mr. and Mrs. Rodman to lunch alone. Then
      he returned to an earlier point of the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You say it was thick with dust?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was. I believe the lower cupboard has never been open since Mr.
      Mutimer&rsquo;s death.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should he take a will to church with him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he did,&rsquo; Mutimer pursued, &lsquo;I suppose it was to think over the new one
      he was going to make. You know, of course, that he never intended <i>this</i>
      to be his will?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We do not know what his last thoughts may have been,&rsquo; Adela replied, in a
      low voice but firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I think we do. I mean to say, we are quite sure he meant to alter <i>this</i>.
      Yottle was expecting the new will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Death took him before he could make it. He left this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her quiet opposition was breath to the fire of his jealousy. He could no
      longer maintain his voice of argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It just means this: you won&rsquo;t hear anything against the will, and you&rsquo;re
      glad of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your loss is mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her and again drew nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not very likely that you&rsquo;ll stay to share it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay?&rsquo; She watched his movements with apprehension. &lsquo;How can I separate
      my future from yours?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He desired to touch her, to give some sign of his mastery, whether
      tenderly or with rude force mattered little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s easy to say that, but we know it doesn&rsquo;t mean much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His tongue stammered. As Adela rose and tried to move apart, he caught her
      arm roughly, then her waist, and kissed her several times about the face.
      Released, she sank back upon the chair, pale, tern fled; her breath caught
      with voiceless sobs. Mutimer turned away and leaned his arms upon the
      mantelpiece. His body trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither could count the minutes that followed. An inexplicable shame kept
      Mutimer silent and motionless. Adela, when the shock of repugnance had
      passed over, almost forgot the subject of their conversation in vain
      endeavours to understand this man in whose power she was. His passion was
      mysterious, revolting&mdash;impossible for her to reconcile with his usual
      bearing, with his character as she understood it. It was more than a year
      since he had mingled his talk to her with any such sign of affection, and
      her feeling was one of outrage. What protection had she? The caresses had
      followed upon an insult, and were themselves brutal, degrading. It was a
      realisation of one of those half-formed fears which had so long haunted
      her in his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would life be with him, away from the protections of a wealthy home,
      when circumstances would have made him once more the London artisan, and
      in doing so would have added harshness to his natural temper; when he
      would no longer find it worth while to preserve the semblance of gentle
      breeding? Was there strength in her to endure that?
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he turned, and she heard him speak her name. She raised her eyes
      with a half-smile of abashment. He approached and took her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you thought what this means to me?&rsquo; he asked, in a much softer
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it must be very hard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean in that way. I&rsquo;m not thinking of the change back to poverty.
      It&rsquo;s my work in New Wanley; my splendid opportunity of helping on
      Socialism. Think, just when everything is fairly started! You can&rsquo;t feel
      it as I do, I suppose. You haven&rsquo;t the same interest in the work. I hoped
      once you would have had.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela remembered what her brother had said, but she could not allude to
      it. To question was useless. She thought of a previous occasion on which
      he had justified himself when accused.
    </p>
    <p>
      He still held her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which would do the most good with this money, he or I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We cannot ask that question.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, we can. We ought to. At all events, <i>I</i> ought to. Think what it
      means. In my hands the money is used for the good of a suffering class,
      for the good of the whole country in the end. He would just spend it on
      himself, like other rich men. It isn&rsquo;t every day that a man of my
      principles gets the means of putting them into practice. Eldon is well
      enough off; long ago he&rsquo;s made up his mind to the loss of Wanley. It&rsquo;s
      like robbing poor people just to give money where it isn&rsquo;t wanted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She withdrew her hand, saying coldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can understand your looking at it in this way. But we can&rsquo;t help it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why can&rsquo;t we?&rsquo; His voice grew disagreeable in its effort to be
      insinuating. &lsquo;It seems to me that we can and ought to help it. It would be
      quite different if you and I had just been enjoying ourselves and thinking
      of no one else.&rsquo; He thought it a skilful stroke to unite their names thus.
      &lsquo;We haven&rsquo;t done anything of the kind; we&rsquo;ve denied ourselves all sorts of
      things just to be able to spend more on New Wanley. You know what I&rsquo;ve
      always said, that I hold the money in trust for the Union. Isn&rsquo;t it true?
      I don&rsquo;t feel justified in giving it up. The end is too important. The good
      of thousands, of hundreds of thousands, is at stake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela looked him in the face searchingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how can we help it? There is the will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer met her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one knows of it but ourselves, Adela.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not indignation that her look expressed, but at first a kind of
      shocked surprise and then profound trouble. It was with difficulty that
      she found words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not speaking in earnest?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am!&rsquo; he exclaimed, almost hopefully. &lsquo;In downright earnest. There&rsquo;s
      nothing to be ashamed of.&rsquo; He said it because he felt that her gaze was
      breeding shame in him. &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t for myself, it&rsquo;s for the cause, for the
      good of my fellowmen. Don&rsquo;t say anything till you&rsquo;ve thought. Look, Adela,
      you&rsquo;re not hardhearted, and you know how it used to pain you to read of
      the poor wretches who can&rsquo;t earn enough to keep themselves alive. It&rsquo;s for
      their sake. If they could be here and know of this, they&rsquo;d go down on
      their knees to you. You <i>can&rsquo;t</i> rob them of a chance! It&rsquo;s like
      snatching a bit of bread out of their mouths when they&rsquo;re dying of
      hunger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fervour with which he pleaded went far to convince himself; for the
      moment he lost sight of everything but the necessity of persuading Adela,
      and his zeal could scarcely have been greater had he been actuated by the
      purest unselfishness. He was speaking as Adela had never heard him speak,
      with modulations of the voice which were almost sentimental, like one
      pleading for love. In his heart he despaired of removing her scruples, but
      he overcame this with vehement entreaty. A true instinct forbade him to
      touch on her own interests; he had not lived so long with Adela without
      attaining some perception of the nobler ways of thought. But as often as
      he raised his eyes to hers he saw the futility of all his words. Her
      direct gaze at length brought him to unwilling silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you then,&rsquo; Adela asked gravely, &lsquo;destroy this will?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The monosyllable was all he cared to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can scarcely believe you. Such a thing is impossible. You could not do
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my duty to do it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is unworthy of you. It is a crime, in law and in conscience. How can
      you so deceive yourself? After such an act as that, whatever you did would
      be worthless, vain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because no one can do great work of the kind you aim at unless he is
      himself guided by the strictest honour. Every word you spoke would be a
      falsehood. Oh, can&rsquo;t you see that, as plainly as the light of day? The
      results of your work! Why, nothing you could possibly do with all this
      money would be one-half as good as to let everyone know that you
      honourably gave it up when it was in your power dishonestly to keep it!
      Oh, surely <i>that</i> is the kind of example that the world needs! What
      causes all the misery but dishonesty and selfishness? If you do away with
      that, you gain all you are working for. The example! You should prize the
      opportunity. You are deceiving yourself; it is a temptation that you are
      yielding to. Think a moment; you will see that I am right. You cannot do a
      thing so unworthy of yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood for a moment doggedly, then replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can and I shall do it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never!&rsquo; Adela rose and faced him. &lsquo;You shall listen to me till you
      understand. You, who pride yourself on your high motives! For your own
      sake scorn this temptation. Let me take the will away. I will put it
      somewhere till to-morrow. You will see clearly by then. I know how
      dreadful this loss seems to you, but you must be stronger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood between her and the table on which the parchment lay, and waved
      her back as she approached. Adela&rsquo;s voice trembled, but there was not a
      note in it that he could resent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wrong yourself, and you are cruel to me. How could I live with you if
      you did such a thing? How could I remain in this house when it was no
      longer yours? It is impossible, a thousand times impossible. You <i>cannot</i>
      mean it! If you do this in spite of everything I can say, you are more
      cruel than if you raised your hand and struck me. You make my life a
      shame; you dishonour and degrade me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all nonsense,&rsquo; he replied sullenly, the jealous motive possessing
      him again at the sight of her gleaming eyes. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s you who don&rsquo;t
      understand, and just because you have no sympathy with my work. Any one
      would think you cared for nothing but to take the money from me, just to&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in his access of spiteful anger he checked himself, and dropped to
      another tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I take all the responsibility. You have nothing to do with it. What seems
      right to me, I shall do. I am your husband, and you&rsquo;ve no voice in a thing
      like this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No voice? Have I no right to save you from ruin? Must a wife stand by and
      see her husband commit a crime? Have you no duty to me? What becomes of
      our married life if you rob me of all respect for you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you I am doing it with a good motive. If you were a thorough
      Socialist, you would respect me all the more. This money was made out of
      overworked&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was laying his hand on the will; she sprang forward and grasped his
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Richard, give it to me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I shall not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had satisfied himself that if the will was actually destroyed she would
      acquiesce in silence; the shame she spoke of would constrain her. He
      pushed her away without violence, and moved towards the door. But her
      muteness caused him to turn and regard her. She was leaning forward, her
      lips parted, her eyes fixed in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Richard!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you trying me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you believe that I should let you do that and help you to hide it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will come to see that I was right, and be glad that I paid no heed to
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know me. Though you are my husband I would make public
      what you had done. Nothing should silence me. Do you drive me to that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The absence of passion in her voice impressed him far more than violence
      could have done. Her countenance had changed from pleading to scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now indeed,&rsquo; Adela continued, &lsquo;I am doing what no woman should have to
      do.&rsquo; Her voice became bitter. &lsquo;I have not a man&rsquo;s strength; I can only
      threaten you with shame which will fall more heavily on myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your word against mine,&rsquo; he muttered, trying to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You could defend yourself by declaring me infamous?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Did he know the meaning of that flash across her face? Only when the words
      were uttered did their full significance strike Adela herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You could defend yourself by saying that I lied against you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He regarded her from beneath his eyebrows as she repeated the question. In
      the silence which followed he seated himself on the chair nearest to him.
      Adela too sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more than a quarter of an hour they remained thus, no word exchanged.
      Then Adela rose and approached her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I order the carriage,&rsquo; she said softly, &lsquo;will you come with me at once
      to Belwick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave no answer. He was sitting with his legs crossed, the will held
      over his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry you have this trial,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;deeply sorry. But you
      have won, I know you have won!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned his eyes in a direction away from her, hesitated, rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get your things on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was going to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Richard!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She held her hand for the parchment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t trust me to the bottom of the stairs?&rsquo; he asked bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She all but laughed with glad confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I will trust you!&rsquo; 
    </p>

      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Adela and her husband did not return from Belwick till eight o&rsquo;clock in
      the evening. In the first place Mr. Yottle had to be sent for from a
      friend&rsquo;s house in the country, where he was spending Sunday; then there
      was long waiting for a train back to Agworth. The Rodmans, much puzzled to
      account for the disorder, postponed dinner. Adela, however, dined alone,
      and but slightly, though she had not eaten since breakfast. Then fatigue
      overcame her. She slept an unbroken sleep till sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      On going down next morning she found &lsquo;Arry alone in the dining-room; he
      was standing at the window with hands in pocket, and, after a glance
      round, averted his face again, a low growl his only answer to her morning
      salutation. Mr. Rodman was the next to appear. He shook hands as usual. In
      his &lsquo;I hope you are well?&rsquo; there was an accent of respectful sympathy.
      Personally, he seemed in his ordinary spirits. He proceeded to talk of
      trifles, but in such a tone as he might have used had there been grave
      sickness in the house. And presently, with yet lower voice and a smile of
      good-humoured resignation, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our journey, I fear, must be postponed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela smiled, not quite in the same way, and briefly assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alice is not very well,&rsquo; Rodman then remarked. &lsquo;I advised her to have
      breakfast upstairs. I trust you excuse her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer made his appearance. He just nodded round, and asked, as he seated
      himself at table&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s been letting Freeman loose? He&rsquo;s running about the garden.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog furnished a topic for a few minutes&rsquo; conversation, then there was
      all but unbroken silence to the end of the meal. Richard&rsquo;s face expressed
      nothing in particular, unless it were a bad night. Rodman kept up his
      smile, and, eating little himself, devoted himself to polite waiting upon
      Adela. When he rose from the table, Richard said to his brother&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll go down as usual. I shall be at the office in half-an-hour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela presently went to the drawing-room. She was surprised to find Alice
      sitting there. Mrs. Rodman had clearly not enjoyed the unbroken rest which
      gave Adela her appearance of freshness and calm; her eyes were swollen and
      red, her lips hung like those of a fretful child that has tired itself
      with sobbing, her hair was carelessly rolled up, her attire slatternly.
      She sat in sullen disorder. Seeing Adela, she dropped her eyes, and her
      lips drew themselves together. Adela hesitated to approach her, but was
      moved to do so by sheer pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve had a bad night,&rsquo; she said kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I suppose I have,&rsquo; was the ungracious reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela stood before her for a moment, but could find nothing else to say.
      She was turning when Alice looked up, her red eyes almost glaring, her
      breast shaken with uncontrollable passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you might have had some consideration,&rsquo; she exclaimed. &lsquo;If you
      didn&rsquo;t care to speak a word for yourself, you might have thought about
      others. What are we to do, I. should like to know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela was struck with consternation. She had been prepared for petulant
      bewailing, but a vehement outburst of this kind was the last thing she
      could have foreseen, above all to have it directed against herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean, Alice?&rsquo; she said with pained surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s all your doing, I suppose,&rsquo; the other pursued, in the same
      voice. &lsquo;What right had you to let him go off in that way without saying a
      word to us? If the truth was known, I expect you were at the bottom of it;
      he wouldn&rsquo;t have been such a fool, whatever he says. What right had you,
      I&rsquo;d like to know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela calmed herself as she listened. Her surprise at the attack was
      modified and turned into another channel by Alice&rsquo;s words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has Richard told you what passed between us?&rsquo; she inquired. It cost her
      nothing to speak with unmoved utterance; the difficulty was not to seem
      too indifferent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s told us as much as he thought fit. His duty! I like that! As if you
      couldn&rsquo;t have stopped him, if you&rsquo;d chosen! You might have thought of
      other people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did he tell you that I tried to stop him?&rsquo; Adela asked, with the same
      quietness of interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, did you?&rsquo; cried Alice, looking up scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course not! Talk about duty! I should think that was plain enough
      duty. I only wish he&rsquo;d come to me with his talk about duty. It&rsquo;s a duty to
      rob people, I suppose? Oh, I understand <i>him</i> well enough. It&rsquo;s an
      easy way of getting out of his difficulties; as well lose his money this
      way as any other. He always thinks of himself first, trust him! He&rsquo;ll go
      down to New Wanley and make a speech, no doubt, and show off&mdash;with
      his duty and all the rest of it! What&rsquo;s going to become of me? You&rsquo;d no
      right to let him go before telling us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would have advised him to say nothing about the will?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Advised him!&rsquo; she laughed angrily. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d have seen if I couldn&rsquo;t do
      something more than advise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear you wouldn&rsquo;t have succeeded in making your brother act
      dishonourably,&rsquo; Adela replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first sarcasm that had ever passed her lips, and as soon as it
      was spoken she turned to leave the room, fearful lest she might say things
      which would afterwards degrade her in her own eyes. Her body quivered. As
      she reached the door Rodman opened it and entered. He bowed to let her
      pass, searching her face the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was gone he approached to Alice, whom he had at once observed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you been up to?&rsquo; he asked sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her head was bent before him, and she gave no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you speak? What&rsquo;s made her look like that? Have you been
      quarrelling with her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quarrelling?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know what I mean well enough. Just tell me what you said. I thought I
      told you to stay upstairs? What&rsquo;s been going on?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I told her she ought to have let us know,&rsquo; replied Alice, timorous, but
      affecting the look and voice of a spoilt child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you&rsquo;ve made a fool of yourself!&rsquo; he exclaimed with subdued violence.
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got to learn that when I tell you to do a thing you do it&mdash;or
      I&rsquo;ll know the reason why! You&rsquo;d no business to come out of your room. Now
      you&rsquo;ll just find her and apologise. You understand? You&rsquo;ll go and beg her
      pardon at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice raised her eyes in wretched bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beg her pardon?&rsquo; she faltered. &lsquo;Oh, how can I? Why, what harm have I
      done, Willis? I&rsquo;m sure I shan&rsquo;t beg her pardon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t? If you talk to me in that way you shall go down on your knees
      before her. You won&rsquo;t?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice had such concentrated savagery in its suppression that Alice
      shrank back in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Willis! How can you speak so! What have I done?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve made a confounded fool of yourself, and most likely spoilt the
      last chance you had, if you want to know. In future, when I say a thing
      understand that I mean it; I don&rsquo;t give orders for nothing. Go and find
      her and beg her pardon. I&rsquo;ll wait here till you&rsquo;ve done it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I <i>can&rsquo;t</i>! Willis, you won&rsquo;t force me to do that? I&rsquo;d rather die
      than humble myself to her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you hear me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood up, almost driven to bay. Her eyes were wet, her poor, crumpled
      prettiness made a deplorable spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t! Why are you so unkind to me? I have only said what any
      one would. I hate her! My lips won&rsquo;t speak the words. You&rsquo;ve no right to
      ask me to do such a thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her wrist was caught in a clutch that seemed to crush the muscles, and she
      was flung back on to the chair. Terror would not let the scream pass her
      lips: she lay with open mouth and staring eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodman looked at her for an instant, then seemed to master his fury and
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That doesn&rsquo;t improve your beauty. Now, no crying out before you&rsquo;re hurt.
      There&rsquo;s no harm done. Only you&rsquo;ve to learn that I mean what I say, that&rsquo;s
      all. Now I haven&rsquo;t hurt you, so don&rsquo;t pretend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you <i>have</i> hurt me!&rsquo; she sobbed wretchedly, with her fingers
      round her injured wrist. &lsquo;I never thought you could be so cruel. Oh, my
      hand! What harm have I done? And you used to say you&rsquo;d never be unkind to
      me, never! Oh, how miserable I am! Is this how you&rsquo;re going to treat me?
      As if I could help it! Willis, you won&rsquo;t begin to be cruel? Oh, my hand!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me look at it. Pooh, what&rsquo;s amiss?&rsquo; He spoke all at once in his usual
      good-natured voice. &lsquo;Now go and find Adela, whilst I wait here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re going to force me to do that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re going to do it. Now don&rsquo;t make me angry again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, frightened again by his look. She took a step or two, then
      turned back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I do this, will you be kind to me, the same as before?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I will. You don&rsquo;t take me for a brute?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She held her bruised wrist to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you&mdash;will you kiss it well again?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The way in which she said it was as nearly pathetic as anything from poor
      Alice could be. Her misery was so profound, and this childish forgiveness
      of an outrage was so true a demonstration of womanly tenderness which her
      character would not allow to be noble. Her husband laughed rather
      uneasily, and did her bidding with an ill grace. But yet she could not go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll promise never to speak&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, of course I promise. Come back to me. Mind, shall know how you
      did it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why? What is she to us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you afterwards.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a dawning of jealousy in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you ought to make your wife lower herself&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His brow darkened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you do as I tell you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved towards the door, stopped to dry her wet cheeks, half looked
      round. What she saw sped her on her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela was just descending the stairs, dressed to go out. Alice let her go
      past without speaking, but followed her through the hall and into the
      garden. Adela turned, saying gently&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you wish to speak to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I said those things. I didn&rsquo;t mean it. I don&rsquo;t think it was
      your fault.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The other smiled; then in that voice which Stella had spoken of as full of
      forgiveness&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it is not my fault, Alice. It couldn&rsquo;t be otherwise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t think of it another moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice would gladly have retreated, but durst not omit what seemed to her
      the essential because the bitterest words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; exclaimed Adela quickly. &lsquo;Go and lie down a little; you look so
      tired. Try not to be unhappy, your husband will not let harm come to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice returned to the house, hating her sister-in-law with a perfect
      hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hated one took her way into Wanley. She had no pleasant mission&mdash;that
      of letting her mother and Letty know what had happened. The latter she
      found in the garden behind the house dancing her baby-boy up and down in
      the sunlight. Letty did not look very matronly, it must be confessed; but
      what she lacked in mature dignity was made up in blue-eyed and
      warm-checked happiness. At the sight of Adela she gave a cry of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, mother&rsquo;s just getting ready to go and say good-bye to you. As soon
      as she comes down and takes this little rogue I shall just slip my own
      things on. We didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d come here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;re not going to-day,&rsquo; Adela replied, playing with the baby&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not going?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Business prevents Richard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How you frightened us by leaving church yesterday! I was on my way to ask
      about you, but Mr. Wyvern met me and said there was nothing the matter.
      And you went to Agworth, didn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Belwick. We had to see Mr. Yottle, the solicitor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham issued from the house, and explanations were again demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Could you give baby to the nurse for a few minutes?&rsquo; Adela asked Letty.
      &lsquo;I should like to speak to you and mother quietly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrangement was effected and all three went into the sitting-room.
      There Adela explained in simple words all that had come to pass;
      emotionless herself, but the cause of utter dismay in her hearers. When
      she ceased there was blank silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham was the first to find her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But surely Mr. Eldon won&rsquo;t take everything from you? I don&rsquo;t think he has
      the power to&mdash;it wouldn&rsquo;t be just; there must be surely some kind of
      provision in the law for such a thing. What did Mr. Yottle say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only that Mr. Eldon could recover the whole estate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The estate!&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Waltham eagerly. &lsquo;But not the money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The estate includes the money, mother. It means everything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Adela!&rsquo; sighed Letty, who sat with her hands on her lap, bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But surely not Mrs. Rodman&rsquo;s settlement?&rsquo; cried the elder lady, who was
      rapidly surveying the whole situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everything,&rsquo; affirmed Adela.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what an extraordinary, what an unheard-of thing! Such injustice I
      never knew! Oh, but Mr. Eldon is a gentleman&mdash;he can never exact his
      legal rights to the full extent. He has too much delicacy of feeling for
      that.&rsquo; Adela glanced at her mother with a curious openness of look&mdash;the
      expression which by apparent negation of feeling reveals feeling of
      special significance. Mrs. Waltham caught the glance and checked her flow
      of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, he could never do that!&rsquo; she murmured the next moment, in a lower
      key, clasping her hands together upon her knees. &lsquo;I am sure he wouldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must remember, mother,&rsquo; remarked Adela with reserve, &lsquo;that Mr.
      Eldon&rsquo;s disposition cannot affect us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear child, what I meant was this: it is impossible for him to go to
      law with your husband to recover the uttermost farthing. How are you to
      restore money that is long since spent? and it isn&rsquo;t as if it had been
      spent in the ordinary way&mdash;it has been devoted to public purposes.
      Mr. Eldon will of course take all these things into consideration. And
      really one must say that it is very strange for a wealthy man to leave his
      property entirely to strangers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not entirely,&rsquo; put in Adela rather absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A hundred and seven pounds a year!&rsquo; exclaimed her mother protestingly.
      &lsquo;My dear love, what <i>can</i> be done with such a paltry sum as that!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must do a good deal with it, dear mother. It will be all we have to
      depend upon until Richard finds&mdash;finds some position.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you are not going to leave the Manor at once?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As soon as ever we can. I don&rsquo;t know what arrangement my husband is
      making. We shall see Mr. Yottle again to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Adela, this is positively shocking! It seems incredible I never thought
      such things could happen. No wonder you looked white when you went out of
      church. How little I imagined! But you know you can come here at any
      moment. You can sleep with me, or we&rsquo;ll have another bed put up in the
      room. Oh, dear; oh, dear! It will take me a long time to understand it.
      Your husband could not possibly object to your living here till he found
      you a suitable home. What <i>will</i> Alfred say? Oh, you must certainly
      come here. I shan&rsquo;t have a moment&rsquo;s&rsquo; rest if you go away somewhere whilst
      things are in this dreadful state.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think that will be necessary,&rsquo; Adela replied with a reassuring
      smile. &lsquo;It might very well have happened that we had nothing at all, not
      even the hundred pounds; but a wife can&rsquo;t run away for reasons of that
      kind&mdash;can she, Letty?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty gazed with her eyes of loving pity, and sighed, &lsquo;I suppose not,
      dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela sat with them for only a few minutes more. She did not feel able to
      chat at length on a crisis such as this, and the tone of her mother&rsquo;s
      sympathy was not soothing to her. Mrs. Waltham had begun to put a
      handkerchief to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t take it to heart,&rsquo; Adela said as she bent and kissed her
      cheek. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t think how little it troubles me&mdash;on my own account.
      Letty, I look to you to keep mother cheerful. Only think what numbers of
      poor creatures would dance for joy if they had a hundred a year left them!
      We must be philosophers, you see. I couldn&rsquo;t shed a tear if I tried ever
      so hard. Good-bye, dear mother!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waltham did not rise, but Letty followed her friend into the hall.
      She had been very silent and undemonstrative; now she embraced Adela
      tenderly. There was still something of the old diffidence in her manner,
      but the effect of her motherhood was discernible. Adela was childless&mdash;a
      circumstance in itself provocative of a gentle sense of protection in
      Letty&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll let us see you every day, darling?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As often as I can, Letty. Don&rsquo;t let mother get low-spirited. There&rsquo;s
      nothing to grieve about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty returned to the sitting-room; Mrs. Waltham was still pressing the
      handkerchief on this cheek and that alternately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How wonderful she is!&rsquo; Letty exclaimed. &lsquo;I feel as if I could never again
      fret over little troubles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Adela has a strong character,&rsquo; assented the mother with mournful pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty, unable to sit long without her baby, fetched it from the nurse&rsquo;s
      arms. The infant&rsquo;s luncheon-hour had arrived, and the nourishment was
      still of Letty&rsquo;s own providing. It was strange to see on her face the slow
      triumph of this ineffable bliss over the grief occasioned by the recent
      conversation. Mrs. Waltham had floated into a stream of talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, what a strange thing it is!&rsquo; she observed, after many other
      reflections, and when the sound of her own voice had had time to soothe.
      &lsquo;On the very morning of the wedding I had the most singular misgiving, a
      feeling I couldn&rsquo;t explain. One would almost think I had foreseen this
      very thing. And you know very well, my dear, that the marriage troubled me
      in many ways. It was not <i>the</i> match for Adela, but then&mdash;.
      Adela, as you say, has a strong character; she is not very easy to reason
      with. I tried to make both sides of the question clear to her. But then
      her prejudice against Mr. Eldon was very strong, and how naturally, poor
      child! Young people don&rsquo;t like to trust to time; they think everything
      must be done quickly. If she had been one to marry for reasons of interest
      it might look like a punishment; but then it was so far otherwise. How
      much better it would have been to wait a few years! One really never knows
      what is going to happen. Young people really ought to trust others&rsquo; 
      experience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty was only lending half an ear. The general character of her
      mother-in-law&rsquo;s monologues did not encourage much attention. She was
      conscious of a little surprise, even now and then of a mild indignation;
      but the baby sucking at her breast lulled her into a sweet maternal
      apathy. She could only sigh from time to time and wonder whether it was a
      good thing or the contrary that Adela had no baby in her trials.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mutimer did not come to the Manor for luncheon. Rodman, who had been
      spending an hour at the works, brought word that business pressed; a host
      of things had to be unexpectedly finished off and put in order. He, Alice,
      and Adela made pretence of a midday meal; then he went into the library to
      smoke a cigar and meditate. The main subject of his meditation was an
      interview with Adela which he purposed seeking in the course of the
      afternoon. But he had also half-a-dozen letters of the first importance to
      despatch to town by the evening post, and these it was well to get off
      hand. He had finished them by half-past three. Then he went to the
      drawing-room, but found it vacant. He sought his wife&rsquo;s chamber. Alice was
      endeavouring to read a novel, but there was recent tear-shedding about her
      eyes, which had not come of the author&rsquo;s pathos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be a pretty picture soon if that goes on,&rsquo; Rodman remarked, with a
      frankness which was sufficiently brutal in spite of his jesting tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t think how you take it so lightly,&rsquo; Alice replied with utter
      despondency, flinging the book aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the good of taking it any other way? Where&rsquo;s Adela?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Adela?&rsquo; She looked at him as closely as her eyes would let her. &lsquo;Why do
      you want her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I asked you where she was. Please to get into the habit of answering my
      questions at once. It&rsquo;ll save time in future.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed about to resent his harshness, but the effort cost her too
      much. She let her head fall forward almost upon her knees and sobbed
      unrestrainedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodman touched her shoulder and shook her, but not roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not be such an eternal fool!&rsquo; he grumbled. &lsquo;Do you know where Adela is
      or not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; came the smothered reply. Then, raising her head, &lsquo;Why do
      you think so much about Adela?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned against the dressing-table and laughed mockingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the matter, eh? You think I&rsquo;m after her! Don&rsquo;t be such a goose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather you call me a goose than a fool, Willis.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, there&rsquo;s not much difference. Now if you&rsquo;ll sit up and behave
      sensibly, I&rsquo;ll tell you why I want her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really? Will you give me a kiss first?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor blubbery princess! Pah! your lips are like a baby&rsquo;s. Now just
      listen, and mind you hold your tongue about what I say. You know there
      used to be something between Adela and Eldon. I&rsquo;ve a notion it went
      farther than we know of. Well, I don&rsquo;t see why we shouldn&rsquo;t get her to
      talk him over into letting you keep your money, or a good part of it. So
      you see it&rsquo;s you I&rsquo;m thinking about after all, little stupid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you really mean that! Kiss me again&mdash;look, I&rsquo;ve wiped my lips,
      You really think you can do that, Willis?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think I can, but it&rsquo;s worth having a try. Eldon has a soft
      side, I know. The thing is to find her soft side. I&rsquo;m going to have a try
      to talk her over. Now, where is she likely to be?&mdash;out in the
      garden?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;s at her mother&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Confound it! Well, I&rsquo;ll go and look about; I can&rsquo;t lose time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll never get her to do anything for <i>me</i>, Willis.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very likely not. But the things that you succeed in are always the most
      unlikely, as you&rsquo;d understand if you&rsquo;d lived my life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At all events, I shan&rsquo;t have to give up my dresses?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hang your dresses&mdash;on the wardrobe pegs!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went downstairs again and out into the garden, thence to the entrance
      gate. Adela had passed it but a few minutes before, and he saw her a
      little distance off. She was going in the direction away from Wanley,
      seemingly on a mere walk. He decided to follow her and only join her when
      she had gone some way. She walked with her head bent, walked slowly and
      with no looking about her. Presently it was plain that she meant to enter
      the wood. This was opportune. But he lost sight of her as soon as she
      passed among the trees. He quickened his pace; saw her turning off the
      main path among the copses. In his pursuit he got astray; he must have
      missed her track. Suddenly he was checked by the sound of voices, which
      seemed to come from a lower level just in front of him. Cautiously he
      stepped forward, till he could see through hazel bushes that there was a
      steep descent before him. Below, two persons were engaged in conversation,
      and he could hear every word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two were Adela and Hubert Eldon. Adela had come to sit for the last
      time in the green retreat which was painfully dear to her. Her husband&rsquo;s
      absence gave her freedom; she used it to avoid the Rodmans and to talk
      with herself. She F was, as we may conjecture, far from looking cheerfully
      into the future. Nor was she content with herself, with her behaviour in
      the drama of these two days. In thinking over the scene with her husband
      she experienced a shame before her conscience which could not at first be
      readily accounted for, for of a truth she had felt no kind of shame in
      steadfastly resisting Mutimer&rsquo;s dishonourable impulse. But she saw now
      that in the judgment of one who could read all her heart she would not
      come off with unmingled praise. Had there not been another motive at work
      in her besides zeal for honour? Suppose the man benefiting by the will had
      been another than Hubert Eldon? Surely that would not have affected her
      behaviour? Not in practice, doubtless; but here was a question of feeling,
      a scrutiny of the soul&rsquo;s hidden velleities. No difference in action, be
      sure; that must ever be upright But what of the heroism in this particular
      case? The difference declared itself; here there had been no heroism
      whatever. To strip herself and her husband when a moment&rsquo;s winking would
      have kept them well clad? Yes, but on whose behalf? Had there not been a
      positive pleasure in making herself poor that Hubert might be rich? There
      was the fatal element in the situation. She came out of the church
      palpitating with joy; the first assurance of her husband&rsquo;s ignominious
      yielding to temptation filled her with, not mere scorn, but with dread.
      Had she not been guilty of mock nobleness in her voice, her bearing? At
      the time she did not feel it, for the thought of Hubert was kept
      altogether in the background. Yes, but she saw now how it had shed light
      and warmth upon her; the fact was not to be denied, because her
      consciousness had not then included it She was shamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pity, is it not? It were so good to have seen her purely noble,
      indignant with unmixed righteousness. But, knowing our Adela&rsquo;s heart, is
      it not even sweeter to bear with her? You will go far before you find
      virtue in which there is no dear sustaining comfort of self. For my part,
      Adela is more to me for the imperfection, infinitely more to me for the
      confession of it in her own mind. How can a woman be lovelier than when
      most womanly, or more precious than when she reflects her own weakness in
      clarity of soul?
    </p>
    <p>
      As she made her way through the wood her trouble of conscience was lost in
      deeper suffering. The scent of undergrowths, which always brought back to
      her the glad days of maidenhood, filled her with the hopelessness of the
      future. There was no return on the path of life; every step made those
      memories of happiness more distant and thickened the gloom about her. She
      could be strong when it was needful, could face the world as well as any
      woman who makes a veil of pride for her bleeding heart; but here, amid the
      sweet wood-perfumes, in silence and secrecy, self-pity caressed her into
      feebleness. The light was dimmed by her tears; she rather felt than saw
      her way. And thus, with moist eyelashes, she came to her wonted
      resting-place. But she found her seat occupied, and by the man whom in
      this moment she could least bear to meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert sat there, bareheaded, lost in thought. Her light footfall did not
      touch his ear. He looked up to find her standing before him, and he saw
      that she had been shedding tears. For an instant she was powerless to
      direct herself; then sheer panic possessed her and she turned to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert started to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Mutimer! Adela!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The first name would not have stayed her, for her flight was as
      unreasoning as that of a fawn. The second, her own name, uttered with
      almost desperate appeal, robbed her of the power of movement. She turned
      to bay, as though an obstacle had risen in her path, and there was terror
      in her white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert drew a little nearer and spoke hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Forgive me! I could not let you go. You seem to have come in answer to my
      thought; I was wishing to see you. Do forgive me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew that he was examining her moist eyes; a rush of blood passed over
      her features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not unless you are willing,&rsquo; Hubert pursued, his voice at its gentlest
      and most courteous. &lsquo;But if I might speak to you for a few minutes&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have heard from Mr. Yottle?&rsquo; Adela asked, without raising her eyes,
      trying her utmost to speak in a merely natural way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. I happened to be at my mother&rsquo;s house. He came last night to obtain
      my address.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was, that a generous impulse, partly of his nature, and in part
      such as any man might know in a moment of unanticipated good fortune, had
      bade him put aside his prejudices and meet Mutimer at once on a footing of
      mutual respect. Incapable of ignoble exultation, it seemed to him that
      true delicacy dictated a personal interview with the man who, judging from
      Yottle&rsquo;s report, had so cheerfully acquitted himself of the hard task
      imposed by honour. But as he walked over from Agworth this zeal cooled.
      Could he trust Mutimer to appreciate his motive? Such a man was capable of
      acting honourably, but the power of understanding delicacies of behaviour
      was not so likely to be his. Hubert&rsquo;s prejudices were insuperable; to his
      mind class differences necessarily argued a difference in the grain. And
      it was not only this consideration that grew weightier as he walked. In
      the great joy of recovering his ancestral home, in the sight of his
      mother&rsquo;s profound happiness, he all but forgot the thoughts that had
      besieged him since his meetings with Adela in London. As he drew near to
      Wanley his imagination busied itself almost exclusively with her; distrust
      and jealousy of Mutimer became fear for Adela&rsquo;s future. Such a change as
      this would certainly have a dire effect upon her life. He thought of her
      frail appearance; he remembered the glimpse of her face that he had caught
      when her husband entered Mrs. Westlake&rsquo;s drawing-room, the startled
      movement she could not suppress. It was impossible to meet Mutimer with
      any show of good-feeling; he wondered how he could have set forth with
      such an object. Instead of going to the Manor he turned his steps to the
      Vicarage, and joined Mr. Wyvern at luncheon. The vicar had of course heard
      nothing of the discovery as yet. In the afternoon Hubert started to walk
      back to Agworth, but instead of taking the direct road he strayed into the
      wood. He was loth to leave the neighbourhood of the Manor; intense anxiety
      to know what Adela was doing made him linger near the place where she was.
      Was she already suffering from brutal treatment? What wretchedness might
      she not be undergoing within those walls!
    </p>
    <p>
      He said she seemed to have sprung up in answer to his desire. In truth,
      her sudden appearance overcame him; her tearful face turned to
      irresistible passion that yearning which, consciously or unconsciously,
      was at all times present in his life. Her grief could have but one
      meaning; his heart went out to her with pity as intense as its longing.
      Other women had drawn his eyes, had captured him with the love of a day;
      but the deep still affection which is independent of moods and impressions
      flowed ever towards Adela. As easily could he have become indifferent to
      his mother as to Adela. As a married woman she was infinitely more to him
      than she had been as a girl; from her conversation, her countenance, he
      knew how richly she had developed, how her intelligence had ripened how
      her character had established itself in maturity. In that utterance of her
      name the secret escaped him before he could think how impossible it was to
      address her so familiarly. It was the perpetual key-word of his thoughts;
      only when he had heard it from his own lips did he realise what he had
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had given the brief answer to her question he could find no more
      words. But Adela spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you wish to say to me, Mr. Eldon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether or no he interpreted her voice by his own feelings, she seemed to
      plead with him to be manly and respect her womanhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only to say the common things which anyone must say in my position, but
      to say them so that you will believe they are not only a form. The
      circumstances are so strange. I want to ask you for your help; my position
      is perhaps harder than yours and Mr. Mutimer&rsquo;s. We must remember that
      there is justice to be considered. If you will give me your aid in doing
      justice as far as r am able&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In fault of any other possible reply he had involved himself in a subject
      which he knew it was far better to leave untouched. He could not complete
      his sentence, but stood before her with his head bent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela scarcely knew what he said; in anguish she sought for a means of
      quitting him, of fleeing and hiding herself among the trees. His accent
      told her that she was the object of his compassion, and she had invited it
      by letting him see her tears. Of necessity he must think that she was
      sorrowing on her own account. That was true, indeed, but how impossible
      for him to interpret her grief rightly? The shame of being misjudged by
      him all but drove her to speak, and tell him that she cared less than
      nothing for the loss that had befallen her. Yet she could not trust
      herself to speak such words. Her heart was beating insufferably; all the
      woman in her rushed towards hysteria and sell-abandonment. It was well
      that Hubert&rsquo;s love was of quality to stand the test of these terrible
      moments. Something he must say, and the most insignificant phrase was the
      best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you sit&mdash;rest after your walk?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She did so; scarcely could she have stood longer. And with the physical
      ease there seemed to come a sudden mental relief. A thought sprang up,
      opening upon her like a haven of refuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is one thing I should like to ask of you,&rsquo; she began, forcing
      herself to regard him directly. &lsquo;It is a great thing, I am afraid; it may
      be impossible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you tell me what it is?&rsquo; he said, quietly filling the pause that
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am thinking of New Wanley.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw a change in his face, slight, but still a change. She spoke more
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you let the works remain as they are, on the same plan? Will you
      allow the workpeople to live under the same rules? I have been among them
      constantly, and I am sure that nothing but good results have come of&mdash;of
      what my husband has done. There is no need to ask you to deal kindly with
      them, I know that. But if you could maintain the purpose&mdash;? It will
      be such a grief to my husband if all his work comes to nothing. There
      cannot be anything against your principles in what I ask. It is so simply
      for the good of men and women whose lives are so hard. Let New Wanley
      remain as an example. Can you do this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert, as he listened, joined his hands behind his back, and turned his
      eyes to the upper branches of the silver birch, which once in his thoughts
      he had likened to Adela. What he heard from her surprised him, and upon
      surprise followed mortification. He knew that she had in appearance
      adopted Mutimer&rsquo;s principles, but his talk with her in London at Mrs.
      Boscobel&rsquo;s had convinced him that her heart was in far other things than
      economic problems and schemes of revolution. She had listened so eagerly
      to his conversation on art and kindred topics; it was so evident that she
      was enjoying a temporary release from a mode of life which chilled all her
      warmer instincts. Yet she now made it her entreaty that he would continue
      Mutimer&rsquo;s work. Beginning timidly, she grew to an earnestness which it was
      impossible to think feigned. He was unprepared for anything of the kind;
      his emotions resented it. Though consciously harbouring no single unworthy
      desire, he could not endure to find Adela zealous on her husband&rsquo;s behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he misled himself? Was the grief that he had witnessed really that of
      a wife for her husband&rsquo;s misfortune? For whatever reason she had married
      Mutimer&mdash;and that <i>could</i> not be love&mdash;married life might
      have engendered affection. He knew Adela to be deeply conscientious; how
      far was it in a woman&rsquo;s power to subdue herself to love at the bidding of
      duty?
    </p>
    <p>
      He allowed several moments to pass before replying to her. Then he said,
      courteously but coldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very sorry that you have asked the one thing I cannot do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela&rsquo;s heart sank. In putting a distance between him and herself she had
      obeyed an instinct of self-preservation; now that it was effected, the
      change in his voice was almost more than she could bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you refuse?&rsquo; she asked, trying, though in vain, to look up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because it is impossible for me to pretend sympathy with Mr. Mutimer&rsquo;s
      views. In the moment that I heard of the will my action with regard to New
      Wanley was determined. What I purpose doing is so inevitably the result of
      my strongest convictions that nothing could change me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you tell me what you are going to do?&rsquo; Adela asked, in a tone more
      like his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will pain You.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yet I should like to know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall sweep away every trace of the mines and the works and the houses,
      and do my utmost to restore the valley to its former state.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, but Adela said nothing. Her fingers played with the leaves
      which grew beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your associations with Wanley of course cannot be as strong as my own. I
      was born here, and every dearest memory of my life connects itself with
      the valley as it used to be. It was one of the loveliest spots to be found
      in England. You can have no idea of the feelings with which I saw this
      change fall upon it, this desolation and defilement&mdash;I must use the
      words which come to me. I might have overcome that grief if I had
      sympathised with the ends. But, as it is, I should act in the same way
      even if I had no such memories. I know all that you will urge. It may be
      inevitable that the green and beautiful spots of the world shall give
      place to furnaces and mechanics&rsquo; dwellings. For my own part, in this
      little corner, at all events, the rum shall be delayed. In this matter I
      will give my instincts free play. Of New Wanley not one brick shall remain
      on another. I will close the mines, and grass shall again grow over them;
      I will replant the orchards and mark out the fields as they were before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see why I cannot do what you ask.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was said in a gentler voice, for insensibly his tone had become almost
      vehement.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found a strange pleasure in emphasising his opposition to her. Perhaps
      he secretly knew that Adela hung upon his words, and in spite of herself
      was drawn into the current of his enthusiasm. But he did not look into her
      face. Had he done so he would have seen it fixed and pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you think grass and trees of more importance than human lives?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke in a voice which sounded coldly ironical in its attempt to be
      merely calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had rather say that I see no value in human lives in a world from which
      grass and trees have vanished. But, in truth, I care little to make my
      position logically sound. The ruling motive in my life is the love of
      beautiful things; I fight against ugliness because it&rsquo;s the only work in
      which I can engage with all my heart. I have nothing of the enthusiasm of
      humanity. In the course of centuries the world may perhaps put itself
      right again; I am only concerned with the present, and I see that
      everywhere the tendency is towards the rule of mean interests, ignoble
      ideals.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you call it ignoble,&rsquo; broke in Adela, &lsquo;to aim at raising men from
      hopeless and degrading toil to a life worthy of human beings?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The end which <i>you</i> have in mind cannot be ignoble. But it is not to
      be reached by means such as these.&rsquo; He pointed down to the valley. &lsquo;That
      may be the only way of raising the standard of comfort among people who
      work with their hands; I take the standpoint of the wholly unpractical
      man, and say that such efforts do not concern me. From my point of view no
      movement can be tolerated which begins with devastating the earth&rsquo;s
      surface. You will clothe your workpeople better, you will give them better
      food and more leisure; in doing so you injure the class that has finer
      sensibilities, and give power to the class which not only postpones
      everything to material well-being, but more and more regards intellectual
      refinement as an obstacle in the way of progress. Progress&mdash;the word
      is sufficient; you have only to think what it has come to mean. It will be
      good to have an example of reaction.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When reaction means misery to men and women and little children?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, even if it meant that. As far as I am concerned, I trust it will
      have no such results. You must distinguish between humanity and
      humanitarianism. I hope I am not lacking in the former; the latter seems
      to me to threaten everything that is most precious in the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you are content that the majority of mankind should be fed and
      clothed and kept to labour?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Personally, quite content; for I think it very unlikely that the majority
      will ever be fit for anything else. I <i>know</i> that at present they
      desire nothing else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then they must be taught to desire more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert again paused. When he resumed it was with a smile which strove to
      be good-humoured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We had better not argue of these things. If I said all that I think you
      would accuse me of brutality. In logic you will overcome me. Put me down
      as one of those who represent reaction and class-prejudice. I am all
      prejudice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have talked a long time,&rsquo; she said, trying to speak lightly. &lsquo;We have
      such different views. I wish there were less class-prejudice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert scarcely noticed her words. She was quitting him, and he clung to
      the last moment of her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall you go&mdash;eventually go to London?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say. My husband has not yet been able to make plans.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The word irritated him. He half averted his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye, Mr. Eldon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not offer her hand&mdash;durst not do so. Hubert bowed without
      speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was near the Manor gates she heard footsteps behind her. She
      turned and saw her husband. Her cheeks flushed, for she had been walking
      in deep thought. It seemed to her for an instant as if the subject of her
      preoccupation could be read upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where have you been?&rsquo; Mutimer asked, indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For a walk. Into the wood.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was examining her, for the disquiet of her countenance could not escape
      his notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did you go alone? It would have done Alice good to get her out a
      little.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid she wouldn&rsquo;t have come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has she been saying anything to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only that she is troubled and anxious.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on together in silence, Mutimer with bowed head and knitted
      brows.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The making a virtue of necessity, though it argues lack of ingenuousness,
      is perhaps preferable to the wholly honest demonstration of snarling over
      one&rsquo;s misfortunes. It may result in good even to the hypocrite, who
      occasionally surprises himself with the pleasure he finds in wearing a
      front of nobility, and is thereby induced to consider the advantages of
      upright behaviour adopted for its own sake. Something of this kind
      happened in the case of Richard Mutimer. Seeing that there was no choice
      but to surrender his fortune, he set to work to make the most of
      abdication, and with the result that the three weeks occupied in settling
      his affairs at New Wanley and withdrawing from the Manor were full of
      cheerful activity. He did not meet Hubert Eldon, all business being
      transacted through Mr. Yottle. When he heard from the latter that it was
      Eldon&rsquo;s intention to make a clean sweep of mines, works, and settlements,
      though for a moment chagrined, he speedily saw that such action, by giving
      dramatic completeness to his career at Wanley and investing its close with
      something of tragic pathos, was in truth what he should most have desired.
      It enabled him to take his departure with an air of profounder sadness;
      henceforth no gross facts would stand in the way of his rhetoric when he
      should enlarge on the possibilities thus nipped in the bud. He was more
      than ever a victim of cruel circumstances; he could speak with noble
      bitterness of his life&rsquo;s work having been swept into oblivion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was supported by a considerable amount of epistolary sympathy. The
      local papers made an interesting story of what had happened in the old
      church at Wanley, and a few of the London journals reported the
      circumstances; in this way Mutimer became known to a wider public than had
      hitherto observed him. Not only did his fellow-Unionists write to
      encourage and moralise, but a number of those people who are ever ready to
      indite letters to people of any prominence, the honestly admiring and the
      windily egoistic, addressed communications either to Wanley Manor or to
      the editor of the &lsquo;Fiery Cross.&rsquo; Mutimer read eagerly every word of each
      most insignificant scribbler; his eyes gleamed and his cheeks grew warm.
      All such letters he brought to Adela, and made her read them aloud; he
      stood with his hands behind his back, his face slightly elevated and at a
      listening angle. At the end he regarded her, and his look said: &lsquo;Behold
      the man who is your husband!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But at length there came one letter distinct from all the rest; it had the
      seal of a Government office. With eyes which scarcely credited what they
      saw Mutimer read some twenty or thirty words from a Minister of the Crown,
      a gentleman of vigorously Radical opinions, who had &lsquo;heard with much
      regret that the undertaking conceived and pursued with such single-hearted
      zeal&rsquo; had come to an untimely end. Mutimer rushed to Adela like a
      schoolboy who has a holiday to announce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Read that now! What do you think of that? Now there&rsquo;s some hope of a
      statesman like that!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela gave forth the letter in a voice which was all too steady. 7 But she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very glad. It must gratify you. He writes very kindly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have to help me to make an answer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela smiled, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ceremonious opening of the hall at New Wanley had been a great day;
      Mutimer tried his best to make the closing yet more effective. Mr.
      Westlake was persuaded to take the chair, but this time the oration was by
      the founder himself. There was a numerous assembly. Mutimer spoke for an
      hour and a quarter, reviewing what he had done, and enlarging on all that
      he might and would have done. There was as much applause as even he could
      desire. The proceedings closed with the reading of an address which was
      signed by all the people of the works, a eulogium and an expression of
      gratitude, not without one or two sentences of fiery Socialism. The
      spokesman was a fine fellow of six feet two, a man named Redgrave, the
      ideal of a revolutionist workman. He was one of the few men at the works
      whom Adela, from observation of their domestic life, had learnt sincerely
      to respect. Before reading the document he made a little speech of his
      own, and said in conclusion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s an example of how the law does justice in a capitalist society.
      The man who makes a grand use of money has it all taken away from him by
      the man who makes no use of it at all, except to satisfy his own malice
      and his own selfishness. If we don&rsquo;t one and all swear to do our utmost to
      change such a state of things as that, all I can say is we&rsquo;re a poor lot,
      and deserve to be worse treated than the animals, that haven&rsquo;t the sense
      to use their strength!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In his reply to the address Richard surpassed himself. He rose in
      excitement; the words that rushed to his lips could scarcely find
      articulate flow. After the due thanks:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow I go to London; I go as poor as the poorest of you, a
      mechanical engineer in search of work. Whether I shall find it or not
      there&rsquo;s no saying. If they turned me out because of my opinions three
      years ago, it&rsquo;s not very likely that they&rsquo;ve grown fonder of me by this
      time. As poor as the poorest of you, I say. Most of you probably know that
      a small legacy is left to me under the will which gives this property into
      other hands. That money will be used, every penny of it, for the
      furtherance of our cause!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a magnificent thought, one of those inspirations which reveal
      latent genius. The hall echoed with shouts of glorification. Adela, who
      sat with her mother and Letty (Mrs. Westlake had not accompanied her
      husband), kept her eyes fixed on the ground; the uproar made her head
      throb.
    </p>
    <p>
      All seemed to be over and dispersal was beginning, when a gentleman stood
      up in the middle of the hall and made signs that he wished to be heard for
      a moment. Mutimer aided him in gaining attention. It was Mr. Yottle, a
      grizzle-headed, ruddy-cheeked veteran of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I merely desire to use this opportunity of reminding those who have been
      employed at the works that Mr. Eldon will be glad to meet them in this
      hall at half-past ten o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morning. It will perhaps be better
      if the men alone attend, as the meeting will be strictly for business
      purposes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela was among the last to leave the room. As she was moving between the
      rows of benches Mr. Westlake approached her. He had only arrived in time
      to take his place on the platform, and he was on the point of returning to
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a note for you from Stella, he said. &lsquo;She has been ailing for a
      fortnight; it wasn&rsquo;t safe for her to come. But she will soon see you, I
      hope.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope so,&rsquo; Adela replied mechanically, as she took the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Westlake only added his &lsquo;good-bye,&rsquo; and went to take leave of Mutimer,
      who was standing at a little distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those who remained to talk with the hero of the day was our old
      friend Keene. Keene had risen in the world, being at present sub-editor of
      a Belwick journal. His appearance had considerably improved, and his
      manner was more ornate than ever. He took Mutimer by the arm and led him
      aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A suggestion&mdash;something that occurred to me whilst you were
      speaking. You must write the history of New Wanley Not too long; a thing
      that could be printed in pamphlet form and sold at a penny or twopence.
      Speak to Westlake see if the Union won&rsquo;t publish. Some simple title: &ldquo;My
      Work in New Wanley,&rdquo; for instance. I&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s well noticed in our
      rag.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bad idea!&rsquo; Mutimer exclaimed, throwing back his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Trust me, not half bad. Be of use in the propaganda. Just think it over,
      and, if you care to, allow me to read it in manuscript. There&rsquo;s a kind of
      art&mdash;eh? you know what I mean; it&rsquo;s only to be got by journalistic
      practice. Yes, &ldquo;My Work in New Wanley&rdquo;; I think that would do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to lecture at Commonwealth Hall next Sunday,&rsquo; Mutimer observed.
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take that for my title.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By-the-bye how&mdash;what was I going to say? Oh yes, how is Mrs.
      Rodman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tolerable, I believe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In London, presumably?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not much&mdash;not taking it to heart much, I hope?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not particularly? I think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should be glad to be remembered&mdash;a word when you see her. Thanks,
      Mutimer, thanks. I must be off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela was making haste to Teach the Manor, that she might read Stella&rsquo;s
      letter She and her husband were to dine this evening with the Walthams&mdash;a
      farewell meal. With difficulty she escaped from her mother and Letty;
      Stella&rsquo;s letter demanded a quarter of an hour of solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached her room, and broke the envelope. Stella never wrote at much
      length, but to-day there were only a few lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My love to you, heart&rsquo;s darling. I am not well enough to come, and I
      think it likely you had rather I did not. But in a few hours you will be
      near me. Come as soon as ever you can. I wait for you like the earth for
      spring. &lsquo;STELLA.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She kissed the paper and put it in the bosom of her dress. It was already
      time to go to her mother&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found her mother and Letty with grave faces; something seemed to have
      disturbed them. Letty tried to smile and appear at ease, but Mrs. Waltham
      was at no pains to hide the source of her dissatisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you know of that, Adela?&rsquo; she asked, with vexation. &lsquo;About the
      annuity, I mean. Had Richard spoken to you of his intention?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela replied with a simple negative. She had not given the matter a
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then he certainly should have done. It was his duty, I consider, to tell
      <i>me</i>. It is in express contradiction of all he has led me to
      understand. What are you going to live on, I should like to know? It&rsquo;s
      very unlikely that he will find a position immediately. He is absolutely
      reckless, wickedly thoughtless! My dear, it is not too late even now. I
      insist on your staying with us until your husband has found an assured
      income. The idea of your going to live in lodgings in an obscure part of
      London is more than I can bear, and <i>now</i> it really appals me. Adela,
      my child, it&rsquo;s impossible for you to go under these circumstances. The
      commonest decency will oblige him to assent to this arrangement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear mother,&rsquo; Adela replied seriously, &lsquo;pray do not reopen that. It
      surely ought to be needless for me to repeat that it is my duty to go to
      London.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Adela darling,&rsquo; began Letty, very timorously, &lsquo;wouldn&rsquo;t it be
      relieving your husband? How much freer he would be to look about, knowing
      you are here safe and in comfort. I really&mdash;I do really think mother
      is right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Adela could make any reply there sounded a knock at the front door;
      Richard came in. He cast a glance round at the three. The others might
      have escaped his notice, but Mrs. Waltham was too plainly perturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has anything happened?&rsquo; he asked in an offhand way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am distressed, more than I can tell you,&rsquo; began his mother-in-law.
      &lsquo;Surely you did not mean what you said about the money&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother!&rsquo; came from Adela&rsquo;s lips, but she checked herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer thrust his hands into his pockets and stood smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I meant it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, pray, what are you and Adela going to live upon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think we shall have any difficulty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But surely one must more than <i>think</i> in a matter such as this. You
      mustn&rsquo;t mind me speaking plainly, Richard. Adela is my only daughter, and
      the thought of her undergoing needless hardships is so dreadful to me that
      I really must speak. I have a plan, and I am sure you will see that it is
      the very best for all of us. Allow Adela to remain with me for a little
      while, just till you have&mdash;have made things straight. It certainly
      would ease your mind. She is so very welcome to a share of our home. You
      would feel less hampered. I am sure you will consent to this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer&rsquo;s smile died away. He avoided Mrs. Waltham&rsquo;s face, and let his
      eyes pass in a cold gaze from Letty, who almost shrank, to Adela, who
      stood with an air of patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you say to this?&rsquo; he asked of his wife, in a tone civil indeed,
      but very far from cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been trying to show mother that I cannot do as she wishes. It is
      very kind of her, but, unless you think it would be better for me to stay,
      I shall of course accompany you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can stay if you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela understood too well what that permission concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no wish to stay.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer turned his look on Mrs. Waltham, without saying anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I can say no more,&rsquo; Mrs. Waltham replied. &lsquo;But you must understand
      that I take leave of my daughter with the deepest concern. I hope you will
      remember that her health for a long time has been anything but good, and
      that she was never accustomed to do hard and coarse work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We won&rsquo;t talk any more of this, mother,&rsquo; Adela interposed firmly. &lsquo;I am
      sure you need have no fear that I shall be tried beyond my strength. You
      must remember that I go with my husband.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The high-hearted one! She would have died rather than let her mother
      perceive that her marriage was less than happy. To the end she would speak
      that word &lsquo;my husband,&rsquo; when it was necessary to speak it at all, with the
      confidence of a woman who knows no other safeguard against the ills of
      life. To the end she would shield the man with her own dignity, and
      protect him as far as possible even against himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer smiled again, this time with satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I certainly think we can take care of ourselves,&rsquo; he remarked briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes they were joined by Alfred, who had only just returned
      from Belwick, and dinner was served. It was not a cheerful evening. At
      Adela&rsquo;s request it had been decided in advance that the final leave-taking
      should be to-night; she and Mutimer would drive to Agworth station
      together with Alfred the first thing in the morning. At ten o&rsquo;clock the
      parting came. Letty could not speak for sobbing; she just kissed Adela and
      hurried from the room. Mrs. Waltham preserved a rather frigid stateliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye, my dear,&rsquo; she said, when released from her daughter&rsquo;s embrace.
      &lsquo;I hope I may have good news from you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With Mutimer she shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a starry and cold night. The two walked side by side without
      speaking. When they were fifty yards on their way, a figure came out of a
      corner of the road, and Adela heard Letty call her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will overtake you,&rsquo; she said to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Adela, my sweet, I <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> say good-bye to you in the house!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty hung about her dear one&rsquo;s neck. Adela choked; she could only press
      her cheek against that moist one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Write to me often&mdash;oh, write often,&rsquo; Letty sobbed. &lsquo;And tell me the
      truth, darling, will you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will be all well, dear sister,&rsquo; Adela whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that is a dear name! Always call me that. I can&rsquo;t say good-bye,
      darling. You will come to see us as soon as ever you can?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As soon as I can, Letty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela found her husband awaiting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did she want?&rsquo; he asked, with genuine surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only to say good-bye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, she&rsquo;d said it once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior of the Manor was not yet disturbed, but all the furniture was
      sold, and would be taken away on the morrow. They went to the drawing
      room. After some insignificant remarks Mutimer asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What letter was that Westlake gave you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was from Stella&mdash;from Mrs. Westlake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you let me see it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, if you wish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt for it in her bosom and handed it to him. It shook in her
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why does she think you&rsquo;d rather she didn&rsquo;t come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose because the occasion seems to her painful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see that it was painful at all. What did you think of my speech?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The first one or the second?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Both, if you like. I meant the first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You told the story very well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll never spoil me by over-praise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About this,&rsquo; he resumed, tapping the note which he still held. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
      think you need go there very often. It seems to me you don&rsquo;t get much good
      from them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Theirs isn&rsquo;t the kind of Socialism I care much about,&rsquo; he continued, with
      the air of giving a solid reason. &lsquo;It seems to me that Westlake&rsquo;s going
      off on a road of his own, and one that leads nowhere. All that twaddle
      to-day about the development of society! I don&rsquo;t think he spoke of me as
      he might have done. You&rsquo;ll see there won&rsquo;t be half a report in the &ldquo;Fiery
      Gross.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela was still silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to say you&rsquo;re not to see Mrs. Westlake at all, if you want
      to,&rsquo; he pursued. &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought she was the kind of woman to
      suit you. If the truth was known, I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s a Socialist at all.
      But then, no more are you, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no one with a more passionate faith in the people than Mrs.
      Westlake,&rsquo; Adela returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Faith! That won&rsquo;t do much good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent a little, then went to another subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rodman writes that he&rsquo;s no intention of giving up the money. I knew it
      would come to that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the law will compel him,&rsquo; Adela exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a roundabout business. Eldon&rsquo;s only way of recovering it is to bring
      an action against me. Then I shall have to go to law with Rodman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how can he refuse? It is&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She checked herself, remembering that words were two-edged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, he writes in quite a friendly way&mdash;makes a sort of joke of it.
      We&rsquo;ve to get what we can of him, he says. But he doesn&rsquo;t get off if I can
      help it. I must see Yottle on our way tomorrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keene wants me to write a book about New Wanley,&rsquo; he said presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A book?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, a small one. It could be called, &ldquo;My Work at New Wanley.&rdquo; It might
      do good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it might,&rsquo; Adela assented absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You look tired. Get off to bed; you&rsquo;ll have to be up early in the
      morning, and it&rsquo;ll be a hard day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela went, hopeful of oblivion till the &lsquo;hard day&rsquo; should dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning they were in Belwick by half-past nine. Alfred took leave
      of them and went off to business. He promised to &lsquo;look them up&rsquo; in London
      before very long, probably at Christmas. Between him and Mutimer there was
      make-believe of cordiality at parting; they had long ceased to feel any
      real interest in each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela had to spend the time in the railway waiting-room whilst her husband
      went to see Yottle. It was a great bare place; when she entered, she found
      a woman in mourning, with a little boy, sitting alone. The child was
      eating a bun, his mother was silently shedding tears. Adela seated herself
      as far from them as possible, out of delicacy, but she saw the woman look
      frequently towards her, and at last rise as if to come and speak. She was
      a feeble, helpless-looking being of about thirty; evidently the need of
      sympathy overcame her, for she had no other excuse for addressing Adela
      save to tell that her luggage had gone astray, and that she was waiting in
      the hope that something might be heard of it. Finding a gentle listener,
      she talked on and on, detailing the wretched circumstances under which she
      had recently been widowed, and her miserable prospects in a strange town
      whither she was going. Adela made an effort to speak in words of comfort,
      but her own voice sounded hopeless in her ears. In the station was a
      constant roaring and hissing, bell-ringing and the shriek of whistles, the
      heavy trundling of barrows, the slamming of carriage-doors; everywhere a
      smell of smoke. It impressed her as though all the &lsquo;world had become
      homeless, and had nothing to do but journey hither and thither in vain
      search of a resting-place. And her waiting lasted more than an hour. But
      for the effort to dry another&rsquo;s tears it would have been hard to restrain
      her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning had threatened rain; when at length the journey to London
      began, the black skies yielded a steady downpour Mutimer was anything but
      cheerful; establishing himself in a corner of the third-class carriage, he
      for a time employed himself with a newspaper; then, throwing it on to
      Adela&rsquo;s lap, closed his eyes as if he hoped to sleep. Adela glanced up and
      down the barren fields of type, but there was nothing that could hold her
      attention, and, by chance looking at her husband&rsquo;s face, she continued to
      examine it. Perhaps he was asleep, perhaps only absorbed in thought. His
      lips were sullenly loose beneath the thick reddish moustache his eyebrows
      had drawn themselves together, scowling. She could not avert her gaze; it
      seemed to her that she was really scrutinising his face for the first
      time, and it was as that of a stranger. Not one detail had the stamp of
      familiarity: the whole repelled her. What was the meaning now first
      revealed to her in that countenance? The features had a massive
      regularity; there was nothing grotesque, nothing on the surface repulsive;
      yet, beholding the face as if it were that of a man unknown to her, she
      felt that a whole world of natural antipathies was between it and her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the face of a man by birth and breeding altogether beneath her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had she understood that as now; never had she conceived so forcibly
      the reason which made him and her husband and wife only in name. Suppose
      that apparent sleep of his to be the sleep of death; he would pass from
      her consciousness like a shadow from the field, leaving no trace behind.
      Their life of union was a mockery; their married intimacy was an unnatural
      horror. He was not of her class, not of her world; only by violent
      wrenching of the laws of nature had they come together. She had spent
      years in trying to convince herself that there were no such distinctions,
      that only an unworthy prejudice parted class from class. One moment of
      true insight was worth more than all her theorising on abstract
      principles. To be her equal this man must be born again, of other parents,
      in other conditions of life. &lsquo;I go back to London a mechanical engineer in
      search of employment.&rsquo; They were the truest words he had ever uttered;
      they characterised him, classed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no claims to aristocratic descent, but her parents were
      gentlefolk; that is to say, they were both born in a position which
      encouraged personal refinement rather than the contrary, which expected of
      them a certain education in excess of life&rsquo;s barest need, which authorised
      them to use the service of ruder men and women in order to secure to
      themselves a margin of life for life&rsquo;s sake. Perhaps for three generations
      her ancestors could claim so much gentility; it was more than enough to
      put a vast gulf between her and the Mutimers. Favourable circumstances of
      upbringing had endowed her with delicacy of heart and mind not inferior to
      that of any woman living; mated with an equal husband, the children born
      of her might hope to take their place among the most beautiful and the
      most intelligent. And her husband was a man incapable of understanding her
      idlest thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened his eyes, looked at her blankly for a moment, stirred his limbs
      to make his position easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pouring rain in London streets. The cab drove eastward, but for no great
      distance. Adela found herself alighting at a lodging-house not far from
      the reservoir at the top of Pentonville Hill. Mutimer had taken these
      rooms a week ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      A servant fresh from the blackleading of a grate opened the door to them,
      grinning with recognition at the sight of Mutimer. The latter had to help
      the cabman to deposit the trunks in the passage. Then Adela was shown to
      her bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the second floor, the ordinary bedroom of cheap furnished
      lodgings, with scant space between the foot of the bed and the fireplace,
      with a dirty wall-paper and a strong musty odour. The window looked upon a
      backyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed from the bedroom to the sitting-room; here was the same vulgar
      order, the same musty smell. The table was laid for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer read his wife&rsquo;s countenance furtively. He could not discover how
      the abode impressed her, and he put no question. When he returned from the
      bedroom she was sitting before the fire, pensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re hungry, I expect?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her appetite was far from keen, but in order not to appear discontented
      she replied that she would be glad of dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant, her hands and face half washed, presently appeared with a
      tray on which were some mutton-chops, potatoes, and a cabbage. Adela did
      her best to eat, but the chops were ill-cooked, the vegetables poor in
      quality. There followed a rice-pudding; it was nearly cold; coagulated
      masses of rice appeared beneath yellowish water. Mutimer made no remark
      about the food till the table was cleared. Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll have to do better than that. The first day, of course&mdash;You&rsquo;ll
      have a talk with the landlady whilst I&rsquo;m out to-night. Just let her see
      that you won&rsquo;t be content with <i>anything</i>; you have to talk plainly
      to these people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll speak about it,&rsquo; Adela replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They made a trouble at first about waiting on us,&rsquo; Mutimer pursued. &lsquo;But
      I didn&rsquo;t see how we could get our own meals very well. You can&rsquo;t cook, can
      you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, and seemed half ashamed to ask the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes; I can cook ordinary things,&rsquo; Adela said. &lsquo;But&mdash;we haven&rsquo;t a
      kitchen, have we?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, no. If we did anything of that kind, it would have to be on this
      fire. She charges us four shillings a week more for cooking the dinner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He added this information in a tone of assumed carelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think we might save that,&rsquo; Adela said. &lsquo;If I had the necessary things&mdash;I
      should like to try, if you will let me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just as you please. I don&rsquo;t suppose the stuff they send us up will ever
      be very eatable. But it&rsquo;s too bad to ask you to do work of that kind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I shan&rsquo;t mind it in the least! It will be far better, better in every
      way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer brightened up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In that case we&rsquo;ll only get them to do the housemaid work. You can
      explain that to the woman; her name is Mrs. Gulliman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think you can make yourself at home, here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, certainly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right. I shall go out now for an hour or so. You can unpack
      your boxes and get things in order a bit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela had her interview with Mrs. Gulliman in the course of the evening,
      and fresh arrangements were made, not perhaps to the landlady&rsquo;s
      satisfaction, though she made a show of absorbing interest and vast
      approval. She was ready to lend her pots and pans till Adela should have
      made purchase of those articles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela had the satisfaction of saving four shillings a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later Mutimer sought eagerly in the &lsquo;Fiery Gross&rsquo; for a report of
      the proceedings at New Wanley. Only half a column was given to the
      subject, the speeches being summarised. He had fully expected that the
      week&rsquo;s &lsquo;leader&rsquo; would be concerned with his affairs, but there was no
      mention of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bought the &lsquo;Tocsin.&rsquo; Foremost stood an article headed, &lsquo;The Bursting of
      a Soap Bubble.&rsquo; It was a satirical review of the history of New Wanley,
      signed by Comrade Roodhouse. He read in one place: &lsquo;Undertakings of this
      kind, even if pursued with genuine enthusiasm, are worse than useless;
      they are positively pernicious. They are half measures, and can only
      result in delaying the Revolution. It is assumed that working-men can be
      kept in a good temper with a little better housing and a little more
      money. That is to aid the capitalists, to smooth over huge wrongs with
      petty concessions, to cry peace where there is no peace. We know this kind
      of thing of old. It is the whole system of wage-earning that must be
      overthrown&mdash;the ideas which rule the relations of employers and
      employed. Away with these palliatives; let us rejoice when we see working
      men starving and ill-clad, for in that way their eyes will be opened. The
      brute who gets the uttermost farthing out of the toil of his wage-slaves
      is more a friend to us and our cause than any namby-pamby Socialist, such
      as the late Dukeling of New Wanley. Socialist indeed! But enough. We have
      probably heard the last of this <i>parvenu</i> and his loudly trumpeted
      schemes. No true friend of the Revolution can be grieved.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer bit his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heard the last of me, have they? Don&rsquo;t be too hasty, Roodhouse.&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      A week later; the scene, the familiar kitchen in Wilton Square. Mrs.
      Mutimer, upon whom time has laid unkind hands since last we saw her, is
      pouring tea for Alice Rodman, who has just come all the way from the West
      End to visit her. Alice, too, has suffered from recent vicissitudes; her
      freshness is to seek, her bearing is no longer buoyant, she is careless in
      attire. To judge from the corners of her mouth, she is confirmed in
      querulous habits; her voice evidences the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was talking of certain events of the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was about half-past twelve&mdash;I&rsquo;d just got into bed&mdash;when the
      servant knocks at my door. &ldquo;Please, mum,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a policeman
      wants to see master.&rdquo; You may think if I wasn&rsquo;t frightened out of my life!
      I don&rsquo;t think it was two minutes before I got downstairs, and there the
      policeman stood in the hall. I told him I was Mrs. Rodman, and then he
      said a young man called Henry Mutimer had got locked up for making a
      disturbance outside a music hall, and he&rsquo;d sent to my husband to bail him
      out. Well, just as we were talking in comes Willis. Rare and astonished he
      was to see me with all my things huddled on and a policeman in the house.
      We did so laugh afterwards; he said he thought I&rsquo;d been committing a
      robbery. But he wouldn&rsquo;t bail &lsquo;Arry, and I couldn&rsquo;t blame him. And now he
      says &lsquo;Arry &lsquo;ll have to do as best he can. He won&rsquo;t get him another place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s lost his place too?&rsquo; asked the mother gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was dismissed yesterday. He says that&rsquo;s why he went drinking too much.
      Out of ten days that he&rsquo;s been in the place he&rsquo;s missed two and hasn&rsquo;t
      been punctual once. I think you might have seen he got off at the proper
      time in the morning, mother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the good o&rsquo; blamin&rsquo; me?&rsquo; exclaimed the old woman fretfully. &lsquo;A
      deal o&rsquo; use it is for me to talk. If I&rsquo;m to be held &lsquo;countable he doesn&rsquo;t
      live here no longer; I know that much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dick was a fool to pay his fine. I&rsquo;d have let him go to prison for seven
      days; it would have given him a lesson.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mutimer sighed deeply, and lost herself in despondent thought. Alice
      sipped her tea and went on with her voluble talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose he&rsquo;ll show up some time to-night unless Dick keeps him. But he
      can&rsquo;t do that, neither, unless he makes him sleep on the sofa in their
      sitting-room. A nice come-down for my lady, to be living in two furnished
      rooms! But it&rsquo;s my belief they&rsquo;re not so badly off as they pretend to be.
      It&rsquo;s all very well for Dick to put on his airs and go about saying he&rsquo;s
      given up every farthing; he doesn&rsquo;t get me to believe that. He wouldn&rsquo;t go
      paying away his pounds so readily. And they have attendance from the
      landlady; Mrs. Adela doesn&rsquo;t soil her fine finger&rsquo;s, trust her. You may
      depend upon it, they&rsquo;ve plenty. She wouldn&rsquo;t speak a word for us; if she
      cared to, she could have persuaded Mr. Eldon to let me keep my money, and
      then there wouldn&rsquo;t have been all this law bother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What bother&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Dick says he&rsquo;ll go to law with my husband to recover the money he
      paid him when we were married. It seems he has to answer for it, because
      he&rsquo;s what they call the administrator, and Mr. Eldon can compel him to
      make it all good again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I thought you said you&rsquo;d given it all up?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s my own money, what was settled on me. I don&rsquo;t see what good it was
      to me; I never had a penny of it to handle. Now they want to get all the
      rest out of us. How are we to pay back the money that&rsquo;s spent and gone,
      I&rsquo;d like to know? Willis says they&rsquo;ll just have to get it if they can. And
      here&rsquo;s Dick going on at me because we don&rsquo;t go into lodgings! I don&rsquo;t
      leave the house before I&rsquo;m obliged, I know that much. We may as well be
      comfortable as long as we can.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The mean thing, that Adela!&rsquo; she pursued after a pause. &lsquo;She was to have
      married Mr. Eldon, and broke it off when she found he wasn&rsquo;t going to be
      as rich as she thought; then she caught hold of Dick. I should like to
      have seen her face when she found that will!&mdash;I wish it had been me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice laughed unpleasantly. Her mother regarded her with an air of curious
      inquiry, then murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dick and she did the honest thing. I&rsquo;ll say so much for them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be even with Mrs. Adela yet,&rsquo; pursued Alice, disregarding the
      remark. &lsquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t speak for me, but she&rsquo;s spoken for herself, no fear.
      She and her airs!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence; then Mrs. Mutimer said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve let the top bedroom for four-and-six.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Arry&rsquo;s room? What&rsquo;s he going to do then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll have to sleep on the chair-bedstead, here in the kitchen. That is,
      if I have him in the &lsquo;ouse at all. And I don&rsquo;t know yet as I shall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you got enough money to go on with?&rsquo; Alice asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dick sent me a pound this morning. I didn&rsquo;t want it&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has he been to see you yet, mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you want him to come, or don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence. Alice looked at her mother askance. The leathern mask
      of a face was working with some secret emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll come if he likes, I s&rsquo;pose,&rsquo; was her abrupt answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the renewed silence they heard some one enter the house and descend the
      kitchen stairs. &lsquo;Arry presented himself. He threw his hat upon a chair,
      and came forward with a swagger to seat himself at the tea-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother did not look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anything to eat?&rsquo; he asked, more loudly than was necessary, as if he
      found the silence oppressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s bread and butter,&rsquo; replied Alice, with lofty scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hullo! Is it you?&rsquo; exclaimed the young man, affecting to recognise his
      sister. &lsquo;I thought you was above coming here Have they turned you out of
      your house?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;ll happen to you, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arry cast a glance towards his mother. Seeing that her eyes were fixed in
      another direction, he began pantomimic interrogation of Alice. The latter
      disregarded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arry presented an appearance less than engaging. He still bore the traces
      of last night&rsquo;s debauch and of his sojourn in the police-cell. There was
      dry mud on the back of his coat, his shirt-cuffs and collar were of a
      slaty hue, his hands and face filthy. He began to eat bread and butter,
      washing down each morsel with a gulp of tea. The spoon remained in the cup
      whilst he drank. To &lsquo;Arry it was a vast relief to be free from the
      conventionalities of Adela&rsquo;s table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That lawyer fellow Yottle&rsquo;s been to see them to-day,&rsquo; he remarked
      presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice looked at him eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What about?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was talk about you and Rodman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did they say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t hear. I was in the other room. But I heard Yottle speaking your
      name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, in fact, heard a few words through the keyhole, but not enough to
      gather the sense of the conversation, which had been carried on in
      discreet tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There you are!&rsquo; Alice exclaimed, addressing her mother. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re plotting
      against us, you see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it &lsquo;ud be Dick&rsquo;s wish to do you harm,&rsquo; said Mrs. Mutimer
      absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dick &lsquo;ll do whatever she tells him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Adela, eh?&rsquo; observed &lsquo;Arry. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a cat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mind your own business!&rsquo; returned his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it is my business. She looked at me as if I wasn&rsquo;t good enough to come
      near her &lsquo;igh-and-mightiness. I&rsquo;m glad to see <i>her</i> brought down a
      peg, chance it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice would not condescend to join her reprobate brother, even in abuse of
      Adela. She very shortly took leave of her mother, who went up to the door
      with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you going to see Dick?&rsquo; Mrs. Mutimer said, in the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shan&rsquo;t see him till he comes to my house,&rsquo; replied Alice sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman stood on the doorstep till her daughter was out of sight,
      then sighed and returned to her kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice returned to her more fashionable quarter by omnibus. Though Rodman
      had declined to make any change in their establishment, he practised
      economy in the matter of his wife&rsquo;s pin-money. Gone were the delights of
      shopping, gone the little lunches in confectioners&rsquo; shops to which Alice,
      who ate sweet things like a child, had been much addicted. Even the
      carriage she could seldom make use of, for Rodman had constant need of it&mdash;to
      save cab-fares, he said. It was chiefly employed in taking him to and from
      the City, where he appeared to have much business at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching home Alice found a telegram from her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall bring three friends to dinner. Be ready for us at half-past seven.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he had assured her that he would dine quietly alone with her at eight
      o&rsquo;clock. Alice, who was weary of the kind of men her husband constantly
      brought, felt it as a bitter disappointment. Besides, it was already after
      six, and there were no provisions in the house. But for her life she durst
      not cause Rodman annoyance by offering a late or insufficient dinner. She
      thanked her stars that her return had been even thus early.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men when they presented themselves were just of the kind she expected&mdash;loud-talking&mdash;their
      interests divided between horse-racing and the money-market; she was a
      cipher at her own table, scarcely a remark being addressed to her. The
      conversation was meaningless to her; it seemed, indeed, to be made
      purposely mysterious; terms of the stock-exchange were eked out with nods
      and winks. Rodman was in far better spirits than of late, whence Alice
      gathered that some promising rascality was under consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner over, she was left to amuse herself as she could in the
      drawing-room. Rodman and his friends continued their talk round the table,
      and did not break up till close upon mid night. Then she heard the men
      take their departure. Rodman presently came up to her and threw himself
      into a chair. His face was very red, a sign with which Alice was familiar;
      but excessive potations apparently had not produced the usual effect, for
      he was still in the best of tempers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seen that young blackguard?&rsquo; he began by asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I went to see mother, and he came while I was there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll have to look after himself in future. You don&rsquo;t catch me helping
      him again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He says Mr. Yottle came to see them to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To see who?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dick and his wife. He heard them talking about us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodman laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let &lsquo;em go ahead! I wish them luck.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But can&rsquo;t they ruin us if they like?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all in a life. It wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time I&rsquo;ve been ruined, old
      girl. Let&rsquo;s enjoy ourselves whilst we can. There&rsquo;s nothing like plenty of
      excitement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all very well for you, Willis. But if you had to sit at home all day
      doing nothing, you wouldn&rsquo;t find it so pleasant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get some novels.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m tired of novels,&rsquo; she replied, sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So Yottle was with them?&rsquo; Rodman said musingly, a smile still on his
      face. &lsquo;I wish I knew what terms they&rsquo;ve come to with Eldon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I could do something to pay out that woman!&rsquo; exclaimed Alice
      bitterly. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s at the bottom of it all. She hates both of us. Dick &lsquo;ud
      never have gone against you but for her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodman, extended in the low chair at full length, fixed an amused look on
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;d like to pay her out, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I just!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! ha! what a vicious little puss you are! It&rsquo;s a good thing I don&rsquo;t
      tell you everything, or you might do damage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice turned to him with eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He let his head fall back, and laughed with a drunken man&rsquo;s hilarity.
      Alice persisted with her question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come and sit here,&rsquo; Rodman said, patting his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice obeyed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it, Willis? What have you found out? Do tell me, there&rsquo;s a dear!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing, old girl: you&rsquo;re losing your good looks. Nothing
      like what you were when I married you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She flushed and looked miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help my looks. I don&rsquo;t believe you care how I look.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t I, though! Why, do you think I&rsquo;d have stuck to you like this if
      I didn&rsquo;t? What was to prevent me from realising all the cash I could and
      clearing off, eh? &lsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t have been the first&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The first what?&rsquo; Alice asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind. You see I didn&rsquo;t do it. Too bad to leave the Princess in the
      lurch, wouldn&rsquo;t it be?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice seemed to have forgotten the other secret. She searched his face for
      a moment, deeply troubled, then asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Willis, I want to know who Clara is?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved his eyes slowly, and regarded her with a puzzled look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clara? What Clara?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Somebody you know of. You&rsquo;ve got a habit of talking in your sleep lately.
      You were calling out &ldquo;Clara!&rdquo; last night, and that&rsquo;s the second time I&rsquo;ve
      heard you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was absent for a few seconds, then laughed and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know anybody called Clara. It&rsquo;s your mistake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m quite sure it isn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; Alice murmured discontentedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, we&rsquo;ll say it is,&rsquo; he rejoined in a firmer voice. &lsquo;If I talk
      in my sleep, perhaps it&rsquo;ll be better for you to pay no attention. I might
      find it inconvenient to live with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice looked frightened at the threat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got a great many secrets from me,&rsquo; she said despondently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I have. It is for your good. I was going to tell you one just
      now, only you don&rsquo;t seem to care to bear it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, I do!&rsquo; Alice exclaimed, recollecting. &lsquo;Is it something about
      Adela?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it delight you to go and get her into a terrible row with Dick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, do tell me! What&rsquo;s she been doing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t quite promise you the fun,&rsquo; he replied, laughing. &lsquo;It may miss
      fire. What do you think of her meeting Eldon alone in the wood that Monday
      afternoon, the day after she found the will, you know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I saw them together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But she&mdash;you don&rsquo;t mean she&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Alice, with all her venom against her brother&rsquo;s wife, had a
      difficulty in attributing this kind of evil to Adela. In spite of herself
      she was incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think what you like,&rsquo; said Rodman. &lsquo;It looks queer, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an extraordinary instance of malice perpetrated out of sheer
      good-humour. Had he not been assured by what he heard in the wood of the
      perfectly innocent relations between Adela and Eldon, he would naturally
      have made some profitable use of his knowledge before this. As long as
      there was a possibility of advantage in keeping on good terms with Adela,
      he spoke to no one of that meeting which he had witnessed. Even now he did
      not know but that Adela had freely disclosed the affair to her husband.
      But his humour was genially mischievous. If he could gratify Alice and at
      the same time do the Mutimers an ill turn, why not amuse himself?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Dick the very first thing in the morning!&rsquo; Alice declared,
      aglow with spiteful anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodman approved the purpose, and went off to bed laughing uproariously.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Adela allowed a week to pass before speaking of her desire to visit Mrs.
      Westlake. In Mutimer a fit of sullenness had followed upon his settlement
      in lodgings. He was away from home a good deal, but his hours of return
      were always uncertain, and Adela could not help thinking that he presented
      himself at unlikely times, merely for the sake of surprising her and
      discovering her occupation. Once or twice she had no knowledge of his
      approach until he opened the door of the room; when she remarked on his
      having ascended the stairs so quietly, he professed not to understand her.
      On one of those occasions she was engaged on a letter to her mother; he
      inquired to whom she was writing, and for reply she merely held out the
      sheet for his perusal. He glanced at the superscription, and handed it
      back. Breathing this atmosphere of suspicion, she shrank from irritating
      him by a mention of Stella, and to go without his express permission was
      impossible. Stella did not write; Adela began to fear lest her illness had
      become more serious. When she spoke at length, it was in one of the
      moments of indignation, almost of revolt, which at intervals came to her,
      she knew not at what impulse. At Wanley her resource at such times had
      been to quit the house, and pace her chosen walk in the garden till she
      was weary. In London she had no refuge, and the result of her loss of
      fresh air had speedily shown itself in moods of impatience which she found
      it very difficult to conquer. Her husband came home one afternoon about
      five o&rsquo;clock, and, refusing to have any tea, sat for several hours in
      complete silence; occasionally he pretended to look at a pamphlet which he
      had brought in with him, but for the most part he sat, with his legs
      crossed, frowning at vacancy. Adela grew feverish beneath the oppression
      of this brooding ill-temper; her endeavour to read was vain; the silence
      was a constraint upon her moving, her breathing. She spoke before she was
      conscious of an intention to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I must go and see Mrs. Westlake to-morrow morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer vouchsafed no answer, gave no sign of having heard. She repeated
      the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you must, you must.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish to,&rsquo; Adela said with an emphasis she could not help. &lsquo;Do you
      object to my going?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was surprised at her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t object. I&rsquo;ve told you I think you get no good there. But go if
      you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She said after a silence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no other friend in London; and if it were only on account of her
      kindness to me, I owe her a visit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, don&rsquo;t talk about it any more; I&rsquo;m thinking of something.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening wore on. At ten o&rsquo;clock the servant brought up a jug of beer,
      which she fetched for Mutimer every night; he said he could not sleep
      without this sedative. It was always the sign for Adela to go to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She visited Stella in the morning, and found her still suffering. They
      talked for an hour, then it was time for Adela to hasten homewards, in
      order to have dinner ready by half-past one. From Stella she had no
      secret, save the one which she did her best to make a secret even to
      herself; she spoke freely of her mode of life, though without comment.
      Stella made no comments in her replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you cannot have lunch with me?&rsquo; she asked when her friend rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot; dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I write to you?&rsquo; Stella said with a meaning look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, to tell me how you are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela had not got far from the house when she saw her husband walking
      towards her. She looked at him steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I happened to be near,&rsquo; he explained, &lsquo;and thought I might as well go
      home with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I might have been gone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I shouldn&rsquo;t have waited long.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The form of his reply discovered that he had no intention of calling at
      the house; Adela understood that he had been in Avenue Road for some time,
      probably had reached it very soon after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning there arrived for Mutimer a letter from Alice. She
      desired to see him; her husband would be from home all day, and she would
      be found at any hour; her business was of importance&mdash;underlined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer went shortly after breakfast, and Alice received him very much as
      she would have done in the days before the catastrophe. She had arrayed
      herself with special care; he found her leaning on cushions, her feet on a
      stool, the eternal novel on her lap. Her brother had to stifle anger at
      seeing her thus in appearance unaffected by the storm which had swept away
      his own happiness and luxuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it you want?&rsquo; he asked at once, without preliminary greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not very polite,&rsquo; Alice returned. &lsquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll take a chair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t much time, so please don&rsquo;t waste what I can afford.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you so busy? Have you found something to do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m likely to have enough to do with people who keep what doesn&rsquo;t belong
      to them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t my doing, Dick,&rsquo; she said more seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you oughtn&rsquo;t to be angry with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not angry. What do you want?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I went to see mother yesterday. I think she wants you to go; it looked
      like it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go some day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s too bad that she should have to keep &lsquo;Arry in idleness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She hasn&rsquo;t to keep him. I send her money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how are you to afford that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not your business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice looked indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you might speak more politely to me in my own house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t your own house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is as long as I live in it. I suppose you&rsquo;d like to see me go back to
      a workroom. It&rsquo;s all very well for you; if you live in lodgings, that
      doesn&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;ve got no money. We have to do the best we can for
      ourselves; we haven&rsquo;t got your chances of making a good bargain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was said with much intention; Alice hall closed her eyes and curled her
      lips in a disdainful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What chances? What do you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps if <i>I</i>&rsquo;d been a particular friend of Mr. Eldon&rsquo;s&mdash;never
      mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He flashed a look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you talking about? Just speak plainly, will you? What do you
      mean by &ldquo;particular friend&rdquo;? I&rsquo;m no more a friend of Eldon&rsquo;s than you are,
      and I&rsquo;ve made no bargain with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t say <i>you</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who then?&rsquo; he exclaimed sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you know? Some one is so very proper, and such a fine lady, I
      shouldn&rsquo;t have thought she&rsquo;d have done things without your knowing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned pale, and seemed to crush the floor with his foot, that he might
      stand firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re talking of Adela?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What about her? Say at once what you&rsquo;ve got to say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Inwardly she was a little frightened, perhaps half wished that she had not
      begun. Yet it was sweet to foresee the thunderbolt that would fall on her
      enemy&rsquo;s head. That her brother would suffer torments did not affect her
      imagination; she had never credited him with strong feeling for his wife;
      and it was too late to draw back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know that she met Mr. Eldon in the wood at Wanley on the day after
      she found the will?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer knitted his brows to regard her. But in speaking he was more
      self-governed than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who told you that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My husband. He saw them together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And heard them talking?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodman had only implied this. Alice&rsquo;s subsequent interrogation had failed
      to elicit more from him than dark hints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer drew a quick breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He must be good at spying. Next time I hope he&rsquo;ll find out something
      worth talking about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice was surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know about it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just as much as Rodman, do you understand that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t believe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She herself had doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to you whether I believe it or not. Just be good enough in
      future to mind your own business; you&rsquo;ll have plenty of it before long. I
      suppose that&rsquo;s what you brought me here for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer; she was vexed and puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you anything else to say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice maintained a stubborn silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alice, have you anything more to tell me about Adela?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you might have spared me the trouble. Tell Rodman with my
      compliments that it would be as well for him to keep out of my way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On quitting the house he walked at a great pace for a quarter of a mile
      before he remembered the necessity of taking either train or omnibus. The
      latter was at hand, but when he had ridden for ten minutes the constant
      stoppages so irritated him that he jumped out and sought a hansom. Even
      thus he did not travel fast enough; it seemed an endless time before the
      ascent of Pentonville Hill began. He descended a little distance from his
      lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was paying the driver another hansom went by; he by chance saw the
      occupant, and it was Hubert Eldon. At least he felt convinced of it, and
      he was in no mind to balance the possibilities of mistake. The hansom had
      come from the street which Mutimer was just entering.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Adela engaged in cooking the dinner; she wore an apron, and the
      sleeves of her dress were pushed up. As he came into the room she looked
      at him with her patient smile; finding that he was in one of his worst
      tempers, she said nothing and went on with her work. A coarse cloth was
      thrown over the table; on it lay a bowl of vegetables which she was
      preparing for the saucepan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was the sight of her occupation, of the cheerful simplicity
      with which she addressed herself to work so unworthy of her; he could not
      speak at once as he had meant to. He examined her with eyes of angry, half
      foiled suspicion. She had occasion to pass him; he caught her arm and
      stayed her before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What has Eldon been doing here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused and shrank a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Eldon has not been here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought her face betrayed a guilty agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I happen to have met him going away. I think you&rsquo;d better tell me the
      truth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have told you the truth. If Mr. Eldon has been to the house, I was not
      aware of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her in silence for a moment, then asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you the greatest hypocrite living?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela drew farther away. She kept her eyes down. Long ago she had
      suspected what was in Mutimer&rsquo;s mind, but she had only been apprehensive
      of the results of jealousy on his temper and on their relations to each
      other; it had not entered her thought that she might have to defend
      herself against an accusation. This violent question affected her
      strangely. For a moment she referred it entirely to the secrets of her
      heart, and it seemed impossible to deny what was imputed to her,
      impossible even to resent his way of speaking. Was she not a hypocrite?
      Had she not many, many times concealed with look and voice an inward state
      which was equivalent to infidelity? Was not her whole life a pretence, an
      affectation of wifely virtues? But the hypocrisy was involuntary; her
      nature had no power to extirpate its causes and put in their place the
      perfect dignity of uprightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you ask me that?&rsquo; she said at length, raising her eyes for an
      instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because it seems to me I&rsquo;ve good cause. I don&rsquo;t know whether to believe a
      word you say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t remember to have told you falsehoods.&rsquo; Her cheeks flushed. &lsquo;Yes,
      one; that I confessed to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It brought to his mind the story of the wedding ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s such a thing as lying when you tell the truth. Do you remember
      that I met you coming back to the Manor that Monday afternoon, a month
      ago, and asked you where you&rsquo;d been?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heart stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Answer me, will you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I remember it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You told me you&rsquo;d been for a walk in the wood. You forgot to say who it
      was you went to meet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      How did he know of this? But that thought came to her only to pass. She
      understood at length the whole extent of his suspicion. It was not only
      her secret feelings that he called in question, he accused her of actual
      dishonour as it is defined by the world&mdash;that clumsy world with its
      topsy-turvydom of moral judgments. To have this certainty flashed upon her
      was, as soon as she had recovered from the shock, a sensible assuagement
      of her misery. In face of this she could stand her ground. Her womanhood
      was in arms; she faced him scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you please to make plain your charge against me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it&rsquo;s plain enough. If a married woman makes appointments in quiet
      places with a man she has no business to see anywhere, what&rsquo;s that called?
      I fancy I&rsquo;ve seen something of that kind before now in cases before the
      Divorce Court.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It angered him that she was not overwhelmed. He saw that she did not mean
      to deny having met Eldon, and to have Alice&rsquo;s story thus confirmed
      inflamed his jealousy beyond endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must believe of me what you like,&rsquo; Adela replied in a slow, subdued
      voice. &lsquo;My word would be vain against that of my accuser, whoever it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your accuser, as you say, happened not only to see you, but to hear you
      talking.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited for her surrender before this evidence. Instead of that Adela
      smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If my words were reported to you, what fault have you to find with me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her confidence, together with his actual ignorance of what Rodman had
      heard, troubled him with doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Answer this question,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Did you make an appointment with that
      man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You did not? Yet you met him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unexpectedly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you talked with him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can you ask? You know that I did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He collected his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Repeat to me what you talked about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I refuse to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course you do!&rsquo; he cried, driven to frenzy. &lsquo;And you think I shall let
      this rest where it is? Have you forgotten that I came to the Westlakes and
      found Eldon there with you? And what was he doing in this street this
      morning if he hadn&rsquo;t come to see you? I begin to understand why you were
      so precious eager about giving up the will. That was your fine sense of
      honesty, of course! You are full of fine senses, but your mistake is to
      think I&rsquo;ve no sense at all. What do you take me for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The thin crust of refinement was shattered; the very man came to light,
      coarse, violent, whipped into fury by his passions, of which injured
      self-love was not the least. Whether he believed his wife guilty or not he
      could not have said; enough that she had kept things secret from him, and
      that he could not overawe her. Whensoever he had shown anger in
      conversation with her, she had made him sensible of her superiority; at
      length he fell back upon his brute force and resolved to bring her to his
      feet, if need be by outrage. Even his accent deteriorated as he flung out
      his passionate words; he spoke like any London mechanic, with defect and
      excess of aspirates, with neglect of g&rsquo;s at the end of words, and so on.
      Adela could not bear it; she moved to the door. But he caught her and
      thrust her back; it was all but a blow. Her face half recalled him to his
      senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anywhere, anywhere, away from this house and from you!&rsquo; Adela replied.
      Effort to command herself was vain; his heavy hand had completed the
      effect of his language, and she, too, spoke as nature impelled her. &lsquo;Let
      me pass! I would rather die than remain here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All the same, you&rsquo;ll stay where you are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, your strength is greater than mine. You can hold me by force. But
      you have insulted me beyond forgiveness, and we are as much strangers as
      if we had never met. You have broken every bond that bound me to you. You
      can make me your prisoner, but like a prisoner my one thought will be of
      escape. I will touch no food whilst I remain here. I have no duties to
      you, and you no claim upon me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All the same, you stay!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Before her sobbing vehemence he had grown calm. These words were so
      unimaginable on her lips that he could make no reply save stubborn
      repetition of his refusal. And having uttered that he went from the room,
      changing the key to the outside and locking her in. Fear lest he might be
      unable to withhold himself from laying hands upon her was the cause of his
      retreat. The lust of cruelty was boiling in him, as once or twice before.
      Her beauty in revolt made a savage of him. He went into the bedroom and
      there waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela sat alone, sobbing still, but tearless. Her high-spirited nature
      once thoroughly aroused, it was some time before she could reason on what
      had come to pass. The possibility of such an end to her miseries had never
      presented itself even in her darkest hours; endurance was all she could
      ever look forward to. As her blood fell into calmer flow she found it hard
      to believe that she had not dreamt this scene of agony. She looked about
      the room. There on the table were the vegetables she had been preparing;
      her hands bore the traces of the work she had done this morning. It seemed
      as though she had only to rise and go on with her duties as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her arm was painful, just below the shoulder. Yes, that was where he had
      seized her with his hard hand to push her away from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had she said in her distraction? She had broken away from him, and
      repudiated her wifehood. Was it not well done? If he believed her
      unfaithful to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      At an earlier period of her married life such a charge would have held her
      mute with horror. Its effect now was not quite the same; she could face
      the thought, interrogate herself as to its meaning, with a shudder,
      indeed, but a shudder which came of fear as well as loathing. Life was no
      longer an untried country, its difficulties and perils to be met with the
      sole aid of a few instincts and a few maxims; she had sounded the depths
      of misery and was invested with the woeful knowledge of what we poor
      mortals call the facts of existence. And sitting here, as on the desert
      bed of a river whose water had of a sudden ceased to flow, she could
      regard her own relation to truths, however desolating, with the mind which
      had rather brave all than any longer seek to deceive itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of that which he imputed to her she was incapable; that such suspicion of
      her could enter his mind branded him with baseness. But his jealousy was
      justified; howsoever it had awakened in him, it was sustained by truth.
      Was it her duty to tell him that, and so to render it impossible for him
      to seek to detain her?
    </p>
    <p>
      But would the confession have any such result? Did he not already believe
      her criminal, and yet forbid her to leave him? On what terms did she stand
      with a man whose thought was devoid of delicacy, who had again and again
      proved himself without understanding of the principles of honour? And
      could she indeed make an admission which would compel her at the same time
      to guard against revolting misconceptions?
    </p>
    <p>
      The question of how he had obtained this knowledge recurred to her. It was
      evident that the spy had intentionally calumniated her, professing to have
      heard her speak incriminating words. She thought of Rodman. He had
      troubled her by his private request that she would appeal to Eldon on
      Alice&rsquo;s behalf, a request which was almost an insult. Could he have been
      led to make it in consequence of his being aware of that meeting in the
      wood? That might well be; she distrusted him and believed him capable even
      of a dastardly revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the troublesome thought that hung darkly in her mind and would
      not come to consciousness? She held it at last; Mutimer had said that he
      met Hubert in the street below. How to explain that? Hubert so near to
      her, perhaps still in the neighbourhood?
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she shrank with fear. What might it mean, if he had really come in
      hope of seeing her? That was unworthy of him. Had she betrayed herself in
      her conversation with him? Then he was worse than cruel to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to her that hours passed. From time to time she heard a movement
      in the next room; Mutimer was still there. There sounded at the house door
      a loud postman&rsquo;s knock, and in a few minutes someone came up the stairs,
      doubtless to bring a letter. The bedroom door opened; she heard her
      husband thank the servant and again shut himself in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire which she had been about to use for cooking was all but dead. She
      rose and put fresh coals on. There was a small oblong mirror over the
      mantelpiece; it showed her so ghastly a face that she turned quickly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she succeeded in escaping from her prison, whither should she go? Her
      mother would receive her, but it was impossible to go to Wanley, to live
      near the Manor. Impossible, too, to take refuge with Stella. If she fled
      and hid herself in some other part of London, how was life to be
      supported? But there were graver obstacles. Openly to flee from her
      husband was to subject herself to injurious suspicions&mdash;it might be,
      considering Mutimer&rsquo;s character, to involve Hubert in some intolerable
      public shame. Or, if that worst extremity were avoided&rsquo;, would it not be
      said that she had deserted her husband because he had suddenly become
      poor?
    </p>
    <p>
      That last thought brought the blood to her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to live with him after this, to smear over a deadly wound and pretend
      it was healed, to read hourly in his face the cowardly triumph over her
      weakness, to submit herself&mdash;Oh, what rescue from this hideous
      degradation! She went to the window, as if it had been possible to escape
      by that way; she turned again and stood moaning, with her hands about her
      head. When was the worst to come in this life so long since bereft of
      hope, so forsaken of support from man or God? The thought of death came to
      her; she subdued the tumult of her agony to weigh it well Whom would she
      wrong by killing herself? Herself, it might be; perchance not even death
      would be sacred against outrage.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard a neighbouring clock strike five, and shortly after her husband
      entered the room. Had she looked at him she would have seen an
      inexplicable animation in his face. He paced the floor once or twice in
      silence, then asked in a hard voice, though the tone was quite other than
      before:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you tell me what it was you talked of that day in the wood?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose by refusing to speak you confess that you dare not let me
      know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Physical torture could not have wrung a word from her. She felt her heart
      surge with hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the cupboard in which food was kept, took out a loaf of bread,
      and cut a slice. He ate it, standing before the window. Then he cleared
      the table and sat down to write a letter; it occupied him for
      hall-an-hour. When it was finished, he put it in his pocket and began
      again to pace the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you going to, sit like that all night?&rsquo; he asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew a deep sigh and rose from her seat. He saw that she no longer
      thought of escaping him. She began to make preparations for tea. As
      helpless in his hands as though he had purchased her in a slave market, of
      what avail to sit like a perverse child? The force of her hatred warned
      her to keep watch lest she brought herself to his level. Without defence
      against indignities which were bitter as death, by law his chattel, as
      likely as not to feel the weight of his hand if she again roused his
      anger, what remained but to surrender all outward things to unthinking
      habit, and to keep her soul apart, nourishing in silence the fire of its
      revolt? It was the most pity-moving of all tragedies, a noble nature
      overcome by sordid circumstances. She was deficient in the strength of
      character which will subdue all circumstances; her strength was of the
      kind that supports endurance rather than breaks a way to freedom. Every
      day, every hour, is some such tragedy played through; it is the inevitable
      result of our social state. Adela could have wept tears of blood; her
      shame was like a branding iron upon her flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was on the second floor of a lodging-house in Pentonville, making tea
      for her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      That husband appeared to have undergone a change since lie quitted her a
      few hours ago. He was still venomous towards her, but his countenance no
      longer lowered dangerously. Something distinct from his domestic troubles
      seemed to be occupying him, something of a pleasant nature. He all but
      smiled now and then; the glances he cast at Adela were not wholly occupied
      with her. He plainly wished to speak, but could not bring himself to do
      so.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ate and drank of what she put before him. Adela took a cup of tea, but
      had no appetite for food. When he had satisfied himself, she removed the
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another half-hour passed. Mutimer was pretending to read. Adela at length
      broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I was wrong in refusing to tell you what passed
      between Mr. Eldon and myself when I by chance met him. Someone seems to
      have misled you. He began by hoping that we should not think ourselves
      hound to leave the Manor until we had had full time to make the necessary
      arrangements. I thanked him for his kindness, and then asked something
      further. It was that, if he could by any means do so, he would continue
      the works at New Wanley without any change, maintaining the principles on
      which they had been begun. He said that was impossible, and explained to
      me what his intentions were, and why he had formed them. That was our
      conversation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer observed her with a smile which affected incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you take your oath that that is true?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. I have told you because I now see that the explanation was owing,
      since you have been deceived. If you disbelieve me, it is no concern of
      mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had taken up some sewing, and, having spoken, went on with it. Mutimer
      kept his eyes fixed upon her. His suspicions never resisted a direct word
      from Adela&rsquo;s lips, though other feelings might exasperate him. What he had
      just heard he believed the more readily because it so surprised him; it
      was one of those revelations of his wife&rsquo;s superiority which abashed him
      without causing evil feeling. They always had the result of restoring to
      him for a moment something of the reverence with which he had approached
      her in the early days of their acquaintance. Even now he could not escape
      the impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What was Eldon doing about here to-day?&rsquo; he asked after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have told you that I did not even know he had been near.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps not. Now, will you just tell me this: Have you written to Eldon,
      or had any letter from him since our marriage?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her fingers would not continue their work. A deadening sensation of
      disgust made her close her eyes as if to shut out the meaning of his
      question. Her silence revived his distrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had rather not answer?&rsquo; he said significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cannot you see that it degrades me to answer such a question? What is
      your opinion of me? Have I behaved so as to lead you to think that I am an
      abandoned woman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After hesitating he muttered: &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t give a plain yes or no.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must not expect it. If you think I use arts to deceive you&mdash;if
      you have no faith whatever in my purity&mdash;it was your duty to let me
      go from you when I would have done so. It is horrible for us to live
      together from the moment that there is such a doubt on either side. It
      makes me something lower than your servant&mdash;something that has no
      name!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered. Had not that been true of her from the very morrow of their
      marriage? Her life was cast away upon shoals of debasement; no sanctity of
      womanhood remained in her. Was not her indignation half a mockery? She
      could not even defend her honesty, her honour in the vulgarest sense of
      the word, without involving herself in a kind of falsehood, which was
      desolation to her spirit. It had begun in her advocacy of uprightness
      after her discovery of the will; it was imbuing her whole nature, making
      her to her own conscience that which he had called her&mdash;a very
      hypocrite.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke more conciliatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, there&rsquo;s one thing, at all events, that you can&rsquo;t refuse to explain.
      Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me that you had met Eldon, and what he meant to do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not prepared herself for the question, and it went to the root of
      her thoughts; none the less she replied instantly, careless how he
      understood the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I kept silence because the meeting had given me pain, because it
      distressed me to have to speak with Mr. Eldon at that place and at that
      time, because I <i>knew</i> how you regard him, and was afraid to mention
      him to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer was at a loss. If Adela had calculated her reply with the deepest
      art she could not have chosen words better fitted to silence him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you have told me every word that passed between you?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That would be impossible. I have told you the substance of the
      conversation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did you ask him to keep the works going on my plan?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can tell you no more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her strength was spent. She put aside her sewing and moved towards the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t feel well. I must rest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just stop a minute. I&rsquo;ve something here I want to show you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned wearily. Mutimer took a letter from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you read that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She took it. It was written in a very clear, delicate hand, and ran thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;DEAR SIR,&mdash;I who address you have lain for two years on a bed from
      which I shall never move till I am carried to my grave. My age is
      three-and-twenty; an accident which happened to me a few days after my
      twenty-first birthday left me without the use of my limbs; it often seems
      to me that it would have been better if I had died, but there is no
      arguing with fate, and the wise thing is to accept cheerfully whatever
      befalls us. I hoped at one time to take an active part in life, and my
      interest in the world&rsquo;s progress is as strong as ever, especially in
      everything that concerns social reform. I have for some time known your
      name, and have constantly sought information about your grand work at New
      Wanley. Now I venture to write (by the hand of a dear friend), to express
      my admiration for your high endeavour, and my grief at the circumstances
      which have made you powerless to continue it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am possessed of means, and, as you see, can spend but little on myself.
      I ask you, with much earnestness, to let me be of some small use to the
      cause of social justice, by putting, in your hands the sum of five hundred
      pounds, to be employed as may seem good to you. I need not affect to be
      ignorant of your position, and it is my great fear lest you should be
      unable to work for Socialism with your undivided energies. Will you accept
      this money, and continue by means of public lecturing to spread the gospel
      of emancipation? That I am convinced is your first desire. If you will do
      me this great kindness, I shall ask your permission to arrange that the
      same sum be paid to you annually, for the next ten years, whether I still
      live or not. To be helping in this indirect way would cheer me more than
      you can think. I enclose a draft on Messrs.&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As I do not know your private address, I send this to the office of the
      &ldquo;Piery Cross.&rdquo; Pardon me for desiring to remain anonymous; many reasons
      necessitate it. If you grant me this favour, will you advertise the word
      &ldquo;Accepted&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; newspaper within ten days?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With heartfelt sympathy and admiration, &lsquo;I sign myself, &lsquo;A FRIEND.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela was unmoved; she returned the letter as if it had no interest for
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think of that?&rsquo; said Mutimer, forgetting their differences in
      his exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad you can continue your work,&rsquo; Adela replied absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was moving away when he again stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here, Adela.&rsquo; He hesitated. &lsquo;Are you still angry with me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry I lost my temper. I didn&rsquo;t mean all I said to you. Will you
      try and forget it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lips spoke for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will try.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t go on doing housework now,&rsquo; he said assuringly. &lsquo;Are you
      going? Come and say good-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached her and laid his hand upon her shoulder. Adela shrank from
      his touch, and for an instant gazed at him with wide eyes of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped his hands and let her go.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      The valley rested. On the morning of Mutimer&rsquo;s departure from Wanley there
      was no wonted clank of machinery, no smoke from the chimneys, no roar of
      iron-smelting furnaces; the men and women of the colony stood idly before
      their houses, discussing prospects, asking each other whether it was
      seriously Mr. Eldon&rsquo;s intention to raze New Wanley, many of them grumbling
      or giving vent to revolutionary threats. They had continued in work thus
      long since the property in fact changed hands, and to most of them it
      seemed unlikely, in spite of every thing, that they would have to go in
      search of new employments. This morning they would hear finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      The valley rested. For several days there had been constant rain; though
      summer was scarcely over, it had turned cold and the sky was cheerless.
      Over Stanbury Hill there were always heavy, dripping clouds, and the
      leaves of Adela&rsquo;s favourite wood were already falling. At the Manor there
      was once more disorder; before Mutimer and his wife took their departure
      the removal of furniture had commenced. Over the whole scene brooded a
      spirit of melancholy. It needed faith in human energy to imagine the
      pollutions swept away, and the seasons peacefully gliding as of old
      between the hillsides and amid meadows and garden closes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert Eldon drove over from Agworth, and was in the Public Hall at the
      appointed time. His business with the men was simple and brief. He had to
      inform them that their employment here was at an end, but that each one
      would receive a month&rsquo;s wages and permission to inhabit their present
      abodes for yet a fortnight. After that they had no longer right of
      tenancy. He added that if any man considered himself specially aggrieved
      by this arrangement, he was prepared to hear and judge the individual
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a murmur of discontent through the room, but no one took upon
      himself to rise and become spokesman of the community. Disregarding the
      manifestation, Hubert described in a few words how and when this final
      business would be transacted; then he left the hall by the door which led
      from the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed a busy week. Claims of all kinds were addressed to him, some
      reasonable, most of them not to be entertained. Mr. Yottle was constantly
      at the Manor; there he and Hubert held a kind of court. Hubert was not
      well fitted for business of this nature; he easily became impatient, and,
      in spite of humane intentions, often suffered from a tumult of his blood,
      when opposed by some dogged mechanic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help it!&rsquo; he exclaimed to Mr. Wyvern one right, after a day of
      peculiar annoyance. &lsquo;We are all men, it is true; but for the brotherhood&mdash;feel
      it who can! I am illiberal, if you like, but in the presence of those
      fellows I feel that I am facing enemies. It seems to me that I have
      nothing in common with them but the animal functions. Absurd? Yes, of
      course, it is absurd; but I speak of how intercourse with them affects me.
      They are our enemies, yours as well as mine; they are the enemies of every
      man who speaks the pure English tongue and does not earn a living with his
      hands. When they face me I understand what revolution means; some of them
      look at me as they would if they had muskets in their hands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not conciliating,&rsquo; remarked the vicar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not, and cannot be. They stir the worst feelings in me; I grow
      arrogant, autocratic. As long as I have no private dealings with them I
      can consider their hardships and judge their characters dispassionately;
      but I must not come to close quarters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have special causes of prejudice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True. If I were a philosopher I should overcome all that. However, my
      prejudice is good in one way; it enables me thoroughly to understand the
      detestation with which they regard me and the like of me. If I had been
      born one of them I should be the most savage anarchist. The moral is, that
      I must hold apart. Perhaps I shall grow cooler in time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The special causes of prejudice were quite as strong on the side of the
      workmen; Hubert might have been far less aristocratic in bearing, they
      would have disliked him as cordially. Most of them took it as a wanton
      outrage that they should be driven from the homes in which they had
      believed themselves settled for life. The man Redgrave&mdash;he of the six
      feet two who had presented the address to Mutimer&mdash;was a powerful
      agent of ill-feeling; during the first few days he was constantly
      gathering impromptu meetings in New Wanley and haranguing them violently
      on the principles of Socialism. But in less than a week he had taken his
      departure, and the main trouble seemed at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eldon was so impatient to return to the Manor that a room was
      prepared for her as soon as possible, and she came from her house at
      Agworth before Mutimer had been gone a week. Through the summer her
      strength had failed rapidly; it was her own conviction that she could live
      but a short time longer. The extreme agitation caused by the discovery of
      the will had visibly enfeebled her; it was her one desire to find herself
      once more in her old home, and there to breathe her last. The journey from
      Agworth cost her extreme suffering; she was prostrate, almost lifeless,
      for three days after it. But her son&rsquo;s society revived her. Knowing him
      established in his family possessions, she only cared to taste for a
      little while this unhoped-for joy. Lying on a couch in her familiar
      chamber, she delighted to have flowers brought to her from the garden,
      even leaves from the dear old trees, every one of which she knew as a
      friend. But she had constant thought for those upon whose disaster her own
      happiness was founded; of Adela she spoke often.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What will become of that poor child?&rsquo; she asked one evening, when Hubert
      had been speaking of Rodman&rsquo;s impracticable attitude, and of the
      proceedings Mutimer was about to take. &lsquo;Do you know anything of her life,
      Hubert?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I met her in the wood here a few weeks ago,&rsquo; he replied, mentioning the
      incident for the first time. &lsquo;She wanted to make a Socialist of me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was that after the will came to light?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The day after. She pleaded for New Wanley&mdash;hoped I should keep it
      up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then she has really accepted her husband&rsquo;s views?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems so. I am afraid she thought me an obstinate tyrant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But she must not suffer, dear. How can they be helped?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They can&rsquo;t fall into absolute want. And I suppose his Socialist friends
      will do something for him. I have been as considerate as it was possible
      to be. I dare say he will make me a commonplace in his lectures
      henceforth, a type of the brutal capitalist.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed when he had said it, and led the conversation to another
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the workmen, too, Mrs. Eldon was kindly thoughtful. Hubert spared
      her his prejudices and merely described what he was doing. She urged him
      to be rather too easy than too exacting with them. It was the same in
      everything; the blessing which had fallen upon her made her full of
      gentleness and sweet charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fortnight&rsquo;s grace was at an end, and it was announced to Hubert that
      the last family had left New Wanley. The rain still continued; as evening
      set in Hubert returned from an inspection of the deserted colony, his
      spirits weighed upon by the scene of desolation. After dinner he sat as
      usual with his mother for a couple of hours, then went to his own room and
      read till eleven o&rsquo;clock. Just as he had thrown aside his book the silence
      of the night was riven by a terrific yell, a savage cry of many voices,
      which came from the garden in the front of the house, and at the same
      instant there sounded a great crashing of glass. The windows behind his
      back were broken and a couple of heavy missiles thundered near him upon
      the floor&mdash;stones they proved to be. He rushed from the room. All the
      lights in the house except his own and that in Mrs. Eldon&rsquo;s room were
      extinguished. He reached his mother&rsquo;s door. Before he could open it the
      yell and the shower of stones were repeated, again with ruin of windows,
      this time on the east side of the Manor. In a moment he was by his
      mother&rsquo;s bed; he saw her sitting up in terror; she was speechless and
      unable even to stretch her arms towards him. An inner door opened and the
      woman who was always in attendance rushed in half dressed. At the same
      time there were sounds of movement in other parts of the house. Once more
      the furious voices and the stone-volley Hubert put his arms about his
      mother and tried to calm her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened; it&rsquo;s those cowardly roughs. They have had their
      three shots, now they&rsquo;ll take to their heels. Mrs. Winter is here, mother:
      she will stay with you whilst I go down and see what has to be done. I&rsquo;ll
      be back directly if there is no more danger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He hastened away. The servants had collected upon the front staircase,
      with lamps and candles, in fright and disorder unutterable. Hubert
      repeated to them what he had said to his mother, and it seemed to be the
      truth, for the silence outside was unbroken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;if they&rsquo;ve made an attempt to set the
      house on fire. We must go about and examine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The door-bell was rung loudly. The servants rushed back up the stairs;
      Hubert went into the dining-room, carrying no light, and called through
      the shattered windows asking who had rung. It was the vicar; the shouts
      had brought him forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are gone,&rsquo; he said, in his strong, deep voice, in itself reassuring.
      &lsquo;I think there were only some ten or a dozen; they&rsquo;ve made off up the
      hill. Is anybody hurt?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, they have only broken all the windows,&rsquo; Hubert replied. &lsquo;But I am
      terribly afraid for the effect upon my mother. We must have the doctor
      round at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar was admitted to the house, and a messenger forthwith despatched
      for the medical man, who resided halfway between Wanley and Agworth. On
      returning to his mother&rsquo;s room Hubert found his fears only too well
      justified; Mrs. Eldon lay motionless, her eyes open, but seemingly without
      intelligence. At intervals of five minutes a sigh was audible, else she
      could scarcely be perceived to breathe. The attendant said that she had
      not spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some time before the doctor arrived. After a brief examination, he
      came out with Hubert; his opinion was that the sufferer would not see
      daybreak.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lived, however, for some twelve hours, if that could be called life
      which was only distinguishable from the last silence by the closest
      scrutiny. Hubert did not move from the bedside, and from time to time Mr.
      Wyvern came and sat with him. Neither of them spoke. Hubert had no thought
      of food or rest; the shadow of a loss, of which he only understood the
      meaning now that it was at hand, darkened him and all the world. Behind
      his voiceless misery was immeasurable hatred of those who had struck him
      this blow; at moments a revengeful fury all but maddened him. He held his
      mother&rsquo;s band; if he could but feel one pressure of the slight fingers
      before they were impotent for ever! And this much was granted him. Shortly
      before midday the open eyes trembled to consciousness, the lips moved in
      endeavour to speak. To Hubert it seemed that his intense gaze had worked a
      miracle, effecting that which his will demanded. She saw him and
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother, can you speak? Do you know me, dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, and her lips tried to shape words. He bent over her, close,
      close. At first the faint whisper was unintelligible, then he heard:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They did not know what they were doing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Something followed, but he could not understand it. The whisper ended in a
      sigh, the smiling features quivered. He held her, but was alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hand was laid gently upon his shoulder. Through blinding tears he
      discerned Mr. Wyvern&rsquo;s solemn countenance. He resisted the efforts to draw
      him away, but was at length persuaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the evening he fell asleep, lying dressed upon his bed, and the
      sleep lasted till midnight. Then he left his room, and descended the
      stairs, for the lower part of the house was still lighted. In the hall Mr.
      Wyvern met him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us go into the library,&rsquo; he said to the clergyman. &lsquo;I want to talk to
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had resumed his ordinary manner. Without mention of his mother, he
      began at once to speak of the rioters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They were led by that man Redgrave; there can be no doubt of that. I
      shall go to Agworth at once and set the police at work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have already done that,&rsquo; replied the vicar. &lsquo;Three fellows have been
      arrested in Agworth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;New Wanley men?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; but Redgrave is not one of them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He shall be caught, though!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert appeared to have forgotten everything but his desire of revenge. It
      supported him through the wretched days that followed&mdash;even at the
      funeral his face was hard-set and his eyes dry. But in spite of every
      effort it was impossible to adduce evidence against any but the three men
      who had loitered drinking in Agworth. Redgrave came forward voluntarily
      and proved an alibi; he was vastly indignant at the charge brought against
      him, declared that window-breaking was not his business, and that had he
      been on the spot he should have used all his influence to prevent such
      contemptible doings. He held a meeting in Belwick of all the New Wanleyers
      he could gather together: those who came repudiated the outrage as useless
      and unworthy. On the whole, it seemed probable that only a handful of
      good-for-nothings had been concerned in the affair, probably men who had
      been loafing in the Belwick public-houses, indisposed to look for work.
      The &lsquo;Fiery Cross&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Tocsin&rsquo; commented on the event in their
      respective ways. The latter organ thought that an occasional demonstration
      of this kind was not amiss; it was a pity that apparently innocent
      individuals should suffer (an allusion to the death of Mrs. Eldon); but,
      after all, what member of the moneyed classes was in reality innocent? An
      article on the subject in the &lsquo;Fiery Cross&rsquo; was signed &lsquo;Richard Mutimer.&rsquo; 
      It breathed righteous indignation and called upon all true Socialists to
      make it known that they pursued their ends in far other ways than by the
      gratification of petty malice. A copy of this paper reached Wanley Manor.
      Hubert glanced over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It lay by him when he received a visit from Mr. Wyvern the same evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is it to be explained,&rsquo; he asked; &lsquo;a man like Westlake mixing himself
      up with this crew?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know him personally?&rsquo; the vicar inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have met him. But I have seen more of Mrs. Westlake. She is a tenth
      muse, the muse of lyrical Socialism. From which of them the impulse came I
      have no means of knowing, but surely it must have been from her. In her
      case I can understand it; she lives in an asthetic reverie; she idealises
      everything. Naturally she knows nothing whatever of real life. She is one
      of the most interesting women I ever met, but I should say that her
      influence on Westlake has been deplorable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Mutimer is greatly her friend, I believe,&rsquo; said the vicar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe so. But let us speak of this paper. I want, if possible, to
      understand Westlake&rsquo;s position. Have you ever read the thing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Frequently.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now here is an article signed by Westlake. You know his books? How has he
      fallen to this? His very style has abandoned him, his English smacks of
      the street corners, of Radical clubs. The man is ruined; it is next. to
      impossible that he should ever again do good work, such as we used to have
      from him. The man who wrote &ldquo;Daphne&rdquo;! Oh, it is monstrous!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is something of a problem to me,&rsquo; Mr. Wyvern admitted. &lsquo;Had he been a
      younger man, or if his writing had been of a different kind. Yet his
      sincerity is beyond doubt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I doubt it,&rsquo; Hubert broke in. &lsquo;Not his sincerity in the beginning; but he
      must long since have ached to free himself. It is such a common thing for
      a man to commit himself to some pronounced position in public life and for
      very shame shrink from withdrawing. He would not realise what it meant.
      Now in the revolutionary societies of the Continent there is something
      that appeals to the imagination. A Nihilist, with Siberia or death before
      him, fighting against a damnable tyranny&mdash;the best might sacrifice
      everything for that. But English Socialism! It is infused with the spirit
      of shopkeeping; it appeals to the vulgarest minds; it keeps one eye on
      personal safety, the other on the capitalist&rsquo;s strong-box; it is stamped
      commonplace, like everything originating with the English lower classes.
      How does it differ from Radicalism, the most contemptible claptrap of
      politics, except in wanting to hurry a little the rule of the mob? Well, I
      am too subjective. Help me, if you can, to understand Westlake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert was pale and sorrow-stricken; his movements were heavy with
      weariness, but he had all at once begun to speak with the old fire, the
      old scorn. He rested his chin upon his hand and waited for his companion&rsquo;s
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At your age,&rsquo; said Mr. Wyvern, smiling half sadly, &lsquo;I, too, had a habit
      of vehement speaking, but it was on the other side. I was a badly paid
      curate working in a wretched parish. I lived among the vilest and poorest
      of the people, and my imagination was constantly at boiling-point. I can
      only suppose that Westlake has been led to look below the surface of
      society and has been affected as I was then. He has the mind of a poet;
      probably he was struck with horror to find over what a pit he had been
      living in careless enjoyment. He is tender-hearted; of a sudden he felt
      himself criminal, to be playing with beautiful toys whilst a whole world
      lived only to sweat and starve. The appeal of the miserable seemed to be
      to him personally. It is what certain sects call conversion in religion, a
      truth addressing itself with unwonted and invincible force to the
      individual soul.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you, too, were a Socialist?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At that age and under those conditions it was right and good. I should
      have been void of feeling and imagination otherwise. Such convictions are
      among relative truths. To be a social enthusiast is in itself neither
      right nor wrong, neither praiseworthy nor the opposite; it is a state to
      be judged in relation to the other facts of a man&rsquo;s life. You will never
      know that state; if you affected it you would be purely contemptible. And
      I myself have outgrown it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you must not think that I am inhuman,&rsquo; said Hubert. &lsquo;The sight of
      distress touches me deeply. To the individual poor man or woman I would
      give my last penny. It is when they rise against me as a class that I
      become pitiless.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I understand you perfectly, though I have not the same prejudices. My old
      zeal lingers with me in the form of tolerance. I can enter into the mind
      of a furious proletarian as easily as into the feeling which you
      represent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how did your zeal come to an end?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In this way; I worked under the conditions I have described to you till I
      was nearly thirty. Then. I broke down physically. At the same time it
      happened that I inherited a small competency. I went abroad, lived in
      Italy for a couple of years. I left England with the firm intention of
      getting my health and then returning to work harder than ever. But during
      those two years I educated myself. When I reached England again I found
      that it was impossible to enter again on the old path; I should have had
      to force myself; it would have been an instance of the kind of thing you
      suggest in explanation of Westlake&rsquo;s persistence. Fortunately I yielded to
      my better sense and altogether shunned the life of towns. I was no longer
      of those who seek to change the world, but of those who are content that
      it should in substance remain as it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how can you be content, if you are convinced that the majority of men
      live only to suffer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is, you who attribute the conviction to me,&rsquo; said the vicar, smiling
      good-naturedly. &lsquo;My conviction is the very opposite. One of the pet
      theories I have developed for myself in recent years is, that happiness is
      very evenly distributed among all classes and conditions. It is the result
      of sober reflection on my experience of life. Think of it a moment. The
      bulk of men are neither rich nor poor, taking into consideration their
      habits and needs; they live in much content, despite social imperfections
      and injustices, despite the ills of nature. Above and below are classes of
      extreme characterisation; I believe the happiness assignable to those who
      are the lowest stratum of civilisation is, relatively speaking, no whit
      less than that we may attribute to the thin stratum of the surface, using
      the surface to mean the excessively rich. It is a paradox, but anyone
      capable of thinking may be assured of its truth. The life of the very
      poorest is a struggle to support their bodies; the richest, relieved of
      that one anxiety, are overwhelmed with such a mass of artificial troubles
      that their few moments of genuine repose do not exceed those vouchsafed to
      their antipodes. You would urge the sufferings of the criminal class under
      punishment? I balance against it the misery of the rich under the scourge
      of their own excesses. It is a mistake due to mere thoughtlessness, or
      ignorance, to imagine the labouring, or even the destitute, population as
      ceaselessly groaning beneath the burden of their existence. Go along the
      poorest street in the East End of London, and you will hear as much
      laughter, witness as much gaiety, as in any thoroughfare of the West.
      Laughter and gaiety of a miserable kind? I speak of it as relative to the
      habits and capabilities of the people. A being of superior intelligence
      regarding humanity with an eye of perfect understanding would discover
      that life was enjoyed every bit as much in the slum as in the palace.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would consider it fair to balance excessive suffering of the body in
      one class against excessive mental suffering in another?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Undoubtedly. It is a fair application of my theory. But let me preach a
      little longer. It is my belief that, though this equality of distribution
      remains a fact, the sum total of happiness in nations is seriously
      diminishing. Not only on account of the growth of population; the poor
      have more to suffer, the rich less of true enjoyment, the mass of
      comfortable people fall into an ever-increasing anxiety. A Radical will
      tell you that this is a transitional state. Possibly, if we accept the
      Radical theories of progress. I held them once in a very light-hearted
      way; I am now far less disposed to accept them as even imaginably true.
      Those who are enthusiastic for the spirit of the age proceed on the
      principle of countenancing evil that good may some day come of it. Such a
      position astonishes me. Is the happiness of a man now alive of less
      account than that of the man who shall live two hundred. years hence?
      Altruism is doubtless good, but only so when it gives pure enjoyment; that
      is to say, when it is embraced instinctively. Shall I frown on a man
      because he <i>cannot</i> find his bliss in altruism and bid him perish to
      make room for a being more perfect? What right have we to live thus in the
      far-off future? Thinking in this way, I have a profound dislike and
      distrust of this same progress. Take one feature of it&mdash;universal
      education. That, I believe, works most patently for the growing misery I
      speak of. Its results affect all classes, and all for the worse. I said
      that I used to have a very bleeding of the heart for the half-clothed and
      quarter-fed hangers-on to civilisation; I think far less of them now than
      of another class in appearance much better off. It is a class created by
      the mania of education, and it consists of those unhappy men and women
      whom unspeakable cruelty endows with intellectual needs whilst refusing
      them the sustenance they are taught to crave. Another generation, and this
      class will be terribly extended, its existence blighting the whole social
      state. Every one of these poor creatures has a right to curse the work of
      those who clamour progress, and pose as benefactors of their race.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All that strikes me as very good and true,&rsquo; remarked Hubert; &lsquo;but can it
      be helped? Or do you refuse to believe in the modern conception of laws
      ruling social development?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I could do so. No; when I spoke of the right to curse, I should
      have said, from their point of view. In truth, I fear we must accept
      progress. But I cannot rejoice in it; I will even do what little I can in
      my own corner to support the old order of things. You may be aware that I
      was on very friendly terms with the Mutimers, that I even seemed to
      encourage them in their Socialism. Yes, and because I felt that in that
      way I could best discharge my duty. What I really encouraged was sympathy
      and humanity. When Mutimer came asking me to be present at his meetings I
      plainly refused. To have held apart from him and his wife would have been
      as wrong in me as to publicly countenance their politics.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvern was on the point of referring to his private reasons for
      befriending Adela, but checked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What I made no secret of approving was their substitution of human
      relations between employer and employed for the detestable &ldquo;nexus of cash
      payment,&rdquo; as Carlyle calls it. That is only a return to the good old
      order, and it seems to me that it becomes more impossible every day. Thus
      far I am with the Socialists, in that I denounce the commercial class, the
      <i>bourgeois</i>, the capitalists&mdash;call them what you will&mdash;as
      the supremely maleficent. They hold us at their mercy, and their mercy is
      nought. Monstrously hypocritical, they cry for progress when they mean
      increased opportunities of swelling their own purses at the expense of
      those they employ, and of those they serve; vulgar to the core, they exalt
      a gross ideal of well-being, and stink in their prosperity. The very poor
      and the uncommercial wealthy alike suffer from them; the intellect of the
      country is poisoned by their influence. They it is who indeed are
      oppressors; they grow rich on the toil of poor girls in London garrets and
      of men who perish prematurely to support their children. I won&rsquo;t talk of
      these people; I should lose my calm views of things and use language too
      much like this of the &ldquo;Fiery Cross.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert was thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is before us?&rsquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Evil; of that I am but too firmly assured. Progress will have its way,
      and its path will be a path of bitterness. A pillar of dark cloud leads it
      by day, and of terrible fire by night. I do not say that the promised land
      may not lie ahead of its guiding, but woe is me for the desert first to be
      traversed! Two vices are growing among us to dread proportions&mdash;indifference
      and hatred: the one will let poverty anguish at its door, the other will
      hound on the vassal against his lord. Papers like the &ldquo;Fiery Cross,&rdquo; even
      though such a man as Westlake edit them, serve the cause of hatred; they
      preach, by implication at all events, the childish theory of the equality
      of men, and seek to make discontented a whole class which only needs
      regular employment on the old conditions to be perfectly satisfied.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Westlake says here that they have no <i>right</i> to be satisfied.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know. It is one of the huge fallacies of the time; it comes of the
      worship of progress. I am content with the fact that, even in our bad day,
      as a class they <i>are</i> satisfied. No, these reforms address themselves
      to the wrong people; they begin at the wrong end. Let us raise our voices,
      if we feel impelled to do so at all, for the old simple Christian rules,
      and do our best to get the educated by the ears. I have my opinion about
      the clergy; I will leave you to guess it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you any belief in the possibility of this revolution they threaten?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None whatever. Changes will come about, but not of these men&rsquo;s making or
      devising. And for the simple reason that they are not sincere. I put aside
      an educated enthusiast such as Westlake. The proletarian Socialists do not
      believe what they say, and therefore they are so violent in saying it.
      They are not themselves of pure and exalted character; they cannot ennoble
      others. If the movement continue we shall see miserable examples of
      weakness led astray by popularity, of despicable qualities aping
      greatness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused somewhat abruptly, for he was thinking of Mutimer, and did not
      wish to make the application too obvious. Hubert restrained a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      They parted shortly after, but not till Hubert had put one more question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you, or do you not, approve of what I am doing down in the valley?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvern thought a moment, and replied gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You being yourself, I approve it heartily. It will gladden my eyes to see
      the grass growing when spring comes round.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook Hubert&rsquo;s hand affectionately and left him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX
    </h2>
    <p>
      We must concern ourselves for a little with the affairs of our old
      acquaintance, Daniel Dabbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel&rsquo;s disillusionment with regard to Richard Mutimer did not affect his
      regularity of attendance at the Socialist lectures, in most things a
      typical English mechanic, he was especially so in his relation to the
      extreme politics of which he declared himself a supporter. He became a
      Socialist because his friend Dick was one; when that was no longer a
      reason, he numbered himself among the followers of Comrade Roodhouse&mdash;first
      as a sort of angry protest, against Mutimer&rsquo;s private treachery, then
      again because he had got into the habit of listening to inflammatory
      discourses every Sunday night, and on the whole found it a pleasant way of
      passing the evening. He enjoyed the oratory of Messrs. Cowes and Cullen;
      he liked to shout &lsquo;Hear, hear!&rsquo; and to stamp when there was general
      applause; it affected him with an agreeable sensation, much like that
      which follows upon a good meal, to hear himself pitied as a hard-working,
      ill-used fellow, and the frequent allusion to his noble qualities sweetly
      flattered him. When he went, home to the public-house after a lively
      debate, and described the proceedings to his brother Nicholas, he always
      ended by declaring that it was &lsquo;as good as a play.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He read the &lsquo;Tocsin,&rsquo; that is to say, he glanced his eye up and down the
      columns and paused wherever he caught words such as &lsquo;villains,&rsquo; &lsquo;titled
      scoundrels,&rsquo; &lsquo;vampires,&rsquo; and so on. The expositions of doctrine he passed
      over; anything in the nature of reasoning muddled him. From hearing them
      incessantly repeated he knew the root theories of Socialism, and could
      himself hold forth on such texts as &lsquo;the community of the means of
      production&rsquo; with considerable fluency and vehemence; but in very fact he
      concerned himself as little with economic reforms as with the principles
      of high art, and had as little genuine belief in the promised revolution
      as in the immortality of his own soul. Had he been called upon to suffer
      in any way for the &lsquo;cause of the people,&rsquo; it would speedily have been
      demonstrated of what metal his enthusiasm was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there came a different kind of test. In the winter which followed upon
      Mutimer&rsquo;s downfall, Nicholas Dabbs fell ill and died. He was married but
      had no children, and his wife had been separated from him for several
      years. His brother Daniel found himself in flourishing circumstances, with
      a public-house which brought in profits of forty pounds a week It goes
      without saying that Daniel forthwith abandoned his daily labour and
      installed himself behind the bar. The position suited him admirably; with
      a barmaid and a potman at his orders (he paid them no penny more than the
      market rate), he stood about in his shirt sleeves and gossiped from morn
      to midnight with such of his friends as had leisure (and money) to spend
      in the temple of Bacchus. From the day that saw him a licensed victualler
      he ceased to attend the Socialist meetings; it was, of course, a
      sufficient explanation to point to the fact that he could not be in two
      places at the same time, for Sunday evening is a season of brisk business
      in the liquor trade. At first he was reticent on the subject of his old
      convictions, but by degrees he found it possible to achieve the true
      innkeeper&rsquo;s art, and speak freely in a way which could offend none of his
      customers. And he believed himself every bit as downright and sincere as
      he had ever been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comfortably established on a capitalist basis, his future assured because
      it depended upon the signal vice of his class, it one day occurred to
      Daniel that he ought to take to himself a helpmeet, a partner of his joys
      and sorrows. He had thought of it from time to time during the past year,
      but only in a vague way; he had even directed his eyes to the woman who
      might perchance be the one most suitable, though with anything but
      assurance of his success if he seriously endeavoured to obtain her. Long
      ago he had ceased to trouble himself about his first love; with
      characteristic acceptance of the accomplished fact, he never really
      imagined that Alice Mutimer, after she became an heiress, could listen to
      his wooing, and, to do him justice, he appreciated the delicacy of his
      position, if he should continue to press his suit. It cost him not a
      little suffering altogether to abandon his hopes, for the Princess had
      captivated him, and if he could have made her his wife he would&mdash;for
      at least twelve months&mdash;have been a proud and exultant man. But all
      that was over; Daniel was heart-free, when he again began to occupy
      himself with womankind; it was a very different person towards whom he
      found himself attracted. This was Emma Vine.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that chance meeting with Mrs. Clay in the omnibus he lost sight of
      the sisters for a while, but one day Kate came to the public-house and
      desired to see him. She was in great misery. Emma had fallen ill, gravely
      ill, and Kate had no money to pay a doctor. The people in the house, where
      she lodged were urging her to send for the parish doctor, but that was an
      extremity to be avoided as long as a single hope remained. She had come to
      borrow a few shillings> in order that she might take Emma in a cab to the
      hospital; perhaps they would receive her as an in-patient. Daniel put his
      hand in his pocket. He did more; though on the point of returning from
      breakfast to his work, he sacrificed the morning to accompany Mrs. Clay
      and help her to get the sick girl to the hospital. Fortunately it was
      found possible to give her a bed; Emma remained in the hospital for seven
      weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel was not hasty in forming attachments. During the seven weeks he
      called three or four times to inquire of Mrs. Clay what progress her
      sister was making, but when Emma came home again, and resumed her usual
      work, he seemed to have no further interest in her. At length Kate came to
      the public-house one Saturday night and wished to pay back half the loan.
      Daniel shook his head. &lsquo;All right, Mrs. Clay; don&rsquo;t you hurt yourself. Let
      it wait till you&rsquo;re a bit better off.&rsquo; Nicholas was behind the bar, and
      when Kate had gone he asked his brother if he hadn&rsquo;t observed something
      curious in Mrs. Clay&rsquo;s behaviour. Daniel certainly had; the brothers
      agreed that she must have been drinking rather more than was good for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rsquo; said Daniel, &lsquo;if she started with the whole o&rsquo; the
      money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Which, indeed, was a true conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time went on, and Daniel had been six months a licensed victualler. It was
      summer once more, and thirsty weather. Daniel stood behind the bar in his
      shirt sleeves, collarless for personal ease, with a white waistcoat, and
      trousers of light tweed. Across his stomach, which already was more portly
      than in his engineering days, swayed a heavy gold chain; on one of his
      fingers was a demonstrative ring. His face and neck were very red; his
      hair, cropped extremely short, gleamed with odorous oils. You could see
      that he prided himself on the spotlessness of his linen; his cuffs were
      turned up to avoid alcoholic soilure; their vast links hung loose for
      better observance by customers. Daniel was a smiling and a happy man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was early on Sunday evening; Hoxton had shaken itself from the
      afternoon slumber, had taken a moderate tea, and was in no two minds about
      the entirely agreeable way of getting through the hours till bedtime.
      Daniel beamed on the good thirsty souls who sought refuge under his roof
      from the still warm rays of the sun. Whilst seeing that no customer lacked
      due attention, he conversed genially with a group of his special friends.
      One of these had been present at a meeting held on Clerkenwell Green that
      morning, a meeting assembled to hear Richard Mutimer. Richard, a year
      having passed since his temporary eclipse, was once more prominent as a
      popular leader. He was addressing himself to the East End especially, and
      had a scheme to propound which, whatever might be its success or the
      opposite, kept him well before the eyes of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s all this &lsquo;ere about?&rsquo; cried one of the group in an impatiently
      contemptuous tone. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t see nothin&rsquo; in it myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can see as he wants money,&rsquo; observed another, laughing. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a good
      many ways o&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; money without earnin&rsquo; it, particular if you&rsquo;ve got a
      tongue as goes like a steam engine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think so bad of him as all that,&rsquo; said the man who had attended
      the meeting. &lsquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t for himself as he wants the money. What do <i>you</i>
      think o&rsquo; this &lsquo;ere job, Dan?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you more about that in a year&rsquo;s time,&rsquo; replied Dabbs, thrusting
      his fingers into his waistcoat pockets. &lsquo;&rsquo;Cording to Mike, we&rsquo;re all goin&rsquo; 
      to be rich before we know it. Let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;ll come true.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his tongue in his cheek and let his eye circle round the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seems to me,&rsquo; said the contemptuous man, &lsquo;he&rsquo;d better look after his own
      people first. Charity begins at &lsquo;ome, eh, mates?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean by that?&rsquo; inquired a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, isn&rsquo;t his brother&mdash;what&rsquo;s his name? Bill&mdash;Jack&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Arry,&rsquo; corrected Daniel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure, &lsquo;Arry; I don&rsquo;t know him myself, but I &lsquo;eard talk of him. It&rsquo;s
      him as is doin&rsquo; his three months&rsquo; &lsquo;ard labour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That ain&rsquo;t no fault o&rsquo; Dick Mutimer&rsquo;s,&rsquo; asserted the apologist. &lsquo;He
      always was a bad &lsquo;un, that &lsquo;Arry. Why, you can say so much, Dan? No, no, I
      don&rsquo;t &lsquo;old with a man&rsquo;s bein&rsquo; cried down cause he&rsquo;s got a brother as
      disgraces himself. It was Dick as got him his place, an&rsquo; a good place it
      was. It wasn&rsquo;t Dick as put him up to thievin&rsquo;, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, that&rsquo;s right enough,&rsquo; said Dabbs. &lsquo;Let a man be judged by his own
      sayin&rsquo;s and doin&rsquo;s. There&rsquo;s queer stories about Dick Mutimer himself, but&mdash;was
      it Scotch or Irish, Mike?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike had planted his glass on the counter in a manner suggesting
      replenishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now that&rsquo;s what I call a cruel question!&rsquo; cried Mike humorously. &lsquo;The man
      as doesn&rsquo;t stick to his country, I don&rsquo;t think much of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The humour was not remarkable, but it caused a roar of laughter to go up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now what I want to know,&rsquo; exclaimed one, returning to the main subject,
      &lsquo;is where Mutimer gets his money to live on. He does no work, we know that
      much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He told us all about that this mornin&rsquo;,&rsquo; replied the authority. &lsquo;He has
      friends as keeps him goin&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s all. As far as I can make out it&rsquo;s a
      sort o&rsquo; subscription.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, there you are!&rsquo; put in Daniel with half a sneer. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t call that
      Socialism. Let a man support himself by his own work, then he&rsquo;s got a
      right to say what he likes. No, no, <i>we</i> know what Socialism means,
      eh, Tom?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man appealed to answered with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, blest if I do, Dan! There&rsquo;s so many kinds o&rsquo; Socialism nowadays.
      Which lot does he pretend to belong to? There&rsquo;s the &ldquo;Fiery Cross,&rdquo; and
      there&rsquo;s Roodhouse with his &ldquo;Tocsin,&rdquo; and now I s&rsquo;pose Dick&rsquo;ll be startin&rsquo; 
      another paper of his own.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; replied Mutimer&rsquo;s supporter. &lsquo;He holds by the &ldquo;Fiery Cross&rdquo;
       still, so he said this mornin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve no opinion o&rsquo; Roodhouse myself. He
      makes a deal o&rsquo; noise, but I can&rsquo;t &lsquo;see as he <i>does</i> anything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t catch Dick Mutimer sidin&rsquo; with Roodhouse,&rsquo; remarked Daniel with
      a wink. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s an old story, eh, Tom?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the talk went on, and the sale of beverages kept pace with it. About
      eight o&rsquo;clock the barmaid informed Daniel that Mrs. Clay wished to see
      him. Kate had entered the house by the private door, and was sitting in
      the bar-parlour. Daniel went to her at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was more slovenly in appearance than ever, and showed all the signs of
      extreme poverty. Her face was not merely harsh and sour, it indicated a
      process of degradation. The smile with which she greeted Daniel was
      disagreeable through excessive anxiety to be ingratiating. Her eyes were
      restless and shrewd. Daniel sat down opposite to her, and rested his
      elbows on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, how&rsquo;s all at &lsquo;ome?&rsquo; he began, avoiding her look as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing much to boast of,&rsquo; Kate replied with an unpleasant giggle. &lsquo;We
      keep alive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Emma all right?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s all right, except for her bad &lsquo;ead-aches. She&rsquo;s had another of &lsquo;em
      this week. But I think it&rsquo;s a bit better to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll have a rest to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The following day was the August bank-holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, she&rsquo;ll have no rest. She&rsquo;s going to do some cleaning in Goswell
      Road.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel drummed with his fingers on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She isn&rsquo;t fit to do it, that&rsquo;s quite certain,&rsquo; Mrs. Clay continued. &lsquo;I
      wish I could get her out for an hour or two. She wants fresh air, that&rsquo;s
      what it is. I s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;re going somewhere to-morrow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was asked insinuatingly, and at the same time with an air of weary
      resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I did think o&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; as far as Epping Forest. D&rsquo;you think you
      could persuade Emma to come? you and the children as well, you know. I&rsquo;ll
      have the mare out if she will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can ask her and see. It &lsquo;ud be a rare treat for us. I feel myself as if
      I couldn&rsquo;t hold up much longer, it&rsquo;s that hot!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw a glance towards the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you have a bottle o&rsquo; lemonade?&rsquo; Daniel asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you. I&rsquo;ve a sort o&rsquo; fainty feeling. If you&rsquo;d just put
      ever such a little drop in it, Mr. Dabbs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel betrayed a slight annoyance. But he went to the door and gave the
      order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Still at the same place?&rsquo; he asked on resuming his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Emma, you mean? Yes, but it&rsquo;s only been half a week&rsquo;s work, this last.
      And I&rsquo;ve as good as nothing to do. There&rsquo;s the children runnin&rsquo; about with
      no soles to their feet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lemonade&mdash;with a dash in it&mdash;was brought to her, and she
      refreshed herself with a deep draught. Perhaps the dash was not
      perceptible enough; she did not seem entirely satisfied, though pretending
      to be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suppose I come round to-night and ask her myself?&rsquo; Daniel said, as the
      result of a short reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It &lsquo;ud be kind of you if you would, Mr. Dabbs. I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;ll tell me
      she can&rsquo;t afford to lose the day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He consulted his watch, then again reflected, still drumming on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll go,&rsquo; he said, rising from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      His coat was hanging on a peg behind the door. He drew it on, and went to
      tell the barmaid that he should be absent exactly twenty minutes. It was
      Daniel&rsquo;s policy to lead his underlings to expect that he might return at
      any moment, though he would probably be away a couple of hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sisters were now living in a street crossing the angle between Goswell
      Road and the City Road. Daniel was not, as a rule, lavish in his
      expenditure, but he did not care to walk any distance, and there was no
      line of omnibuses available. He took a hansom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It generally fell to Emma&rsquo;s share to put her sister&rsquo;s children to bed, for
      Mrs. Clay was seldom at home in the evening. But for Emma, indeed, the
      little ones would have been sadly off for motherly care. Kate had now and
      then a fit of maternal zeal, but it usually ended in impatience and
      slappings; for the most part she regarded her offspring as encumbrance,
      and only drew attention to them when she wished to impress people with the
      hardships of her lot. The natural result was that the boy and girl only
      knew her as mother by name; they feared her, and would shrink to Emma&rsquo;s
      side when Kate began to speak crossly.
    </p>
    <p>
      All dwelt together in one room, for life was harder than ever. Emma&rsquo;s
      illness had been the beginning of a dark and miserable time. Whilst she
      was in the hospital her sister took the first steps on the path which
      leads to destruction; with scanty employment, much time to kill, never a
      sufficiency of food, companions only too like herself in their distaste
      for home duties and in the misery of their existence, poor Kate got into
      the habit of straying aimlessly about the streets, and, the inevitable
      consequence, of seeking warmth and company in the public-house. Her
      children lived as the children of such mothers do: they played on the
      stairs or on the pavements, had accidents, were always dirty, cried
      themselves to sleep in hunger and pain. When Emma returned, still only fit
      for a convalescent home, she had to walk about day after day in search of
      work, conciliating the employers whom Mrs. Clay had neglected or
      disgusted, undertaking jobs to which her strength was inadequate, and, not
      least, striving her hardest to restore order in the wretched home. It was
      agreed that Kate should use the machine at home, whilst Emma got regular
      employment in a workroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma never heard of that letter which her sister wrote to Mutimer&rsquo;s wife.
      Kate had no expectation that help would come of it; she hoped that it had
      done Mutimer harm, and the hope had to satisfy her. She durst not let Emma
      suspect that she had done such a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma heard, however, of the loan from Daniel Dabbs, and afterwards thanked
      him for his kindness, but she resolutely set her face against the
      repetition of such favours, though Daniel would have willingly helped when
      she came out of the hospital. Kate, of course, was for accepting anything
      that was offered; she lost her temper, and accused Emma of wishing to
      starve the children. But she was still greatly under her sister&rsquo;s
      influence, and when Emma declared that there must be a parting between
      them if she discovered that anything was secretly accepted from Mr. Dabbs,
      Kate sullenly yielded the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel was aware of all this, and it made an impression upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-night Emma was as usual left alone with the children. After tea, when
      Kate left the house, she sat down to the machine and worked for a couple
      of hours; for her there was small difference between Sunday and week day.
      Whilst working she told the children stories; it was a way of beguiling
      them from their desire to go and play in the street. They were strange
      stories, half recollected from a childhood which, had promised better
      things than a maidenhood of garret misery, half Emma&rsquo;s own invention. They
      had a grace, a spontaneity, occasionally an imaginative brightness, which
      would have made them, if they had been taken down from the lips, models of
      tale-telling for children. Emma had two classes of story: the one
      concerned itself with rich children, the other with poor; the one highly
      fanciful, the other full of a touching actuality, the very essence of a
      life such as that led by the listeners themselves. Unlike the novel which
      commends itself to the world&rsquo;s grown children, these narratives had by no
      means necessarily a happy ending; for one thing Emma saw too deeply into
      the facts of life, and was herself too sad, to cease her music on a merry
      chord; and, moreover, it was half a matter of principle with her to make
      the little ones thoughtful and sympathetic; she believed that they would
      grow up kinder and more self-reliant if they were in the habit of thinking
      that we are ever dependent on each other for solace and strengthening
      under the burden of life. The most elaborate of her stories, one wholly of
      her own invention, was called &lsquo;Blanche and Janey.&rsquo; It was a double
      biography. Blanche and Janey were born on the same day, they lived ten
      years, and then died on the same day. But Blanche was, the child of
      wealthy parents; Janey was born, in a garret. Their lives were recounted
      in parallel, almost year by year, and, there was sadness in the contrast.
      Emma had chosen the name of the poor child in memory of her own sister,
      her ever dear Jane, whose life had been a life of sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story ended thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, they died on the same day, and they were buried, on the same day.
      But not in the same cemetery, oh no! Blanche&rsquo;s grave is far away over
      there&rsquo;&mdash;she pointed to the west&mdash;&lsquo;among tombstones covered with
      flowers, and her father and mother go every Sunday to read her name, and
      think and talk of her. Janey was buried far away over yonder&rsquo;&mdash;she
      pointed to the east&mdash;&lsquo;but there is no stone on her grave, and no one
      knows the exact place where she lies, and no one, no one ever goes to
      think and talk of her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The sweetness of the story lay in the fact that the children were both
      good, and both deserved to be happy; it never occurred to Emma to teach
      her hearers to hate little Blanche just because hers was the easier lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever might be her secret suffering, with the little ones Emma was
      invariably patient and tender. However dirty they had made, themselves
      during the day, however much they cried when hunger made them irritable,
      they went to their aunt&rsquo;s side with the assurance of finding gentleness in
      reproof and sympathy with their troubles. Yet once she was really angry.
      Bertie told her a deliberate untruth, and she at once discovered it. She
      stood silent for a few moments, looking as Bertie had never seen her look.
      Then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know, Bertie, that it is wrong to try and deceive?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she tried to, make him understand why falsehood was evil, and as she
      spoke to the child her voice quivered, her breast heaved. When the little
      fellow was overcome, and began to sob, Emma checked herself, recollecting
      that she had lost sight of the offender&rsquo;s age, and was using expressions
      which he could not understand. But the lesson was effectual. If ever the
      brother and sister were tempted to hide anything by a falsehood they
      remembered &lsquo;Aunt Emma&rsquo;s&rsquo; face, and durst not incur the danger of her
      severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she told her stories to the humming of the machine, and when it was
      nearly the children&rsquo;s bedtime she broke off to ask them if they would like
      some bread and butter. Among all the results of her poverty the bitterest
      to Emma was when she found herself <i>hoping that the children would not
      eat much</i>. If their appetite was poor it made her anxious about their
      health, yet it happened sometimes that she feared to ask them if they were
      hungry lest the supply of bread should fail. It was so to-night. The
      week&rsquo;s earnings had been three shillings; the rent itself was four. But
      the children were as ready to eat as if they had had no tea. It went to
      her heart to give them each but one half-slice and tell them that they
      could have no more. Gladly she would have robbed herself of breakfast next
      morning on their account, but that she durst not do, for she had
      undertaken to scrub out an office in Goswell Road, and she knew that her
      strength would fail if she went from home fasting.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put them to bed&mdash;they slept together on a small bedstead, which
      was a chair during the day&mdash;and then sat down to do some patching at
      a dress of Kate&rsquo;s. Her face when she communed with her own thoughts was
      profoundly sad, but far from the weakness of self-pity. Indeed she did her
      best not to think of herself; she knew that to do so cost her struggles
      with feelings she held to be evil, resentment and woe of passion and
      despair. She tried to occupy herself solely with her sister and the
      children, planning how to make Kate more home-loving and how to find the
      little ones more food.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no companions. The girls whom she came to know in the workroom for
      the most part took life very easily; she could not share in their genuine
      merriment; she was often revolted by their way of thinking and speaking.
      They thought her dull; and paid no attention to her. She was glad to be
      relieved of the necessity of talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sister thought her hard. Kate believed that she was for ever brooding
      over her injury. This was not true, but a certain hardness in her
      character there certainly was. For her life, both of soul and body, was
      ascetic; she taught herself to expect, to hope for, nothing. When she was
      hungry she had a sort of pleasure in enduring; when weary she worked on as
      if by effort she could overcome the feeling. But Kate&rsquo;s chief complaint
      against her was her determination to receive no help save in the way of
      opportunity to earn money. This was something more than, ordinary pride.
      Emma suffered intensely in the recollection that she had lived at
      Mutimer&rsquo;s expense during the very months when he was seeking the love of
      another woman, and casting about for means of abandoning herself. When she
      thought of Alice coming with the proposal that she and her sister should
      still occupy the house in Wilton Square, and still receive money, the heat
      of shame and anger never failed to rise to her cheeks. She could never
      accept from anyone again a penny which she had not earned. She believed
      that Daniel Dabbs had been repaid, otherwise she could not have rested a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her terrible misfortune to have feelings too refined for the
      position in which fate had placed her. Had she only been like those other
      girls in the workroom! But we are interesting in proportion to our
      capacity for suffering, and dignity comes of misery nobly borne.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she sat working on Kate&rsquo;s dress, she was surprised to hear a heavy step
      approaching. There came a knock at the door; she answered, admitting
      Daniel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked about the room, partly from curiosity, partly through
      embarrassment. Dusk was falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Young &lsquo;uns in bed?&rsquo; he said, lowering his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, they are asleep,&rsquo; Emma replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mind me coming up?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the window and looked at the houses opposite, then at the
      flushed sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bank holiday to-morrow. I thought I&rsquo;d like to ask you whether you and
      Mrs. Clay and the children &lsquo;ud come with me to Epping Forest. If it&rsquo;s a
      day like this, it&rsquo;ll be a nice drive&mdash;do you good. You look as if you
      wanted a breath of fresh air, if you don&rsquo;t mind me sayin&rsquo; it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you, Mr. Dabbs,&rsquo; Emma replied. &lsquo;I am very sorry I can&rsquo;t
      come myself, but my sister and the children perhaps&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not refuse for them likewise, yet she was troubled to accept so
      far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why can&rsquo;t <i>you</i> come?&rsquo; he asked good-naturedly, slapping his hat
      against his leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have some work that&rsquo;ll take me nearly all day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you&rsquo;ve no business to work on a bank holiday. I&rsquo;m not sure as it
      ain&rsquo;t breakin&rsquo; the law.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, and Emma did her best to show a smile. But she said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you <i>will</i> come, now? You can lose just the one day? It&rsquo;ll do
      you a power o&rsquo; good. You&rsquo;ll work all the better on Tuesday, now see if you
      don&rsquo;t. Why, it ain&rsquo;t worth livin&rsquo;, never to get a holiday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry. It was very kind indeed of you to think of it, Mr. Dabbs.
      I really can&rsquo;t come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went again to the window, and thence to the children&rsquo;s bedside. He bent
      a little and watched them breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bertie&rsquo;s growin&rsquo; a fine little lad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, indeed, he is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll have to go to school soon, I s&rsquo;pose&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid he gives you a
      good deal of trouble, that is, I mean&mdash;you know how I mean it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, he is very good,&rsquo; Emma said, looking at the sleeping face
      affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel had meant something different; he saw that Emma would not
      understand him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We see changes in life,&rsquo; he resumed, musingly. &lsquo;Now who&rsquo;d a&rsquo; thought I
      should end up with having more money than I. know how to use? The &lsquo;ouse
      has done well for eight years now, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s likely to do well for a good
      many years yet, as far as I can see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad to hear that,&rsquo; Emma replied constrainedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Vine, I wanted you to come to Epping Forest to-morrow because I
      thought I should have a chance of a little talk. I don&rsquo;t mean that was the
      only reason; it&rsquo;s too bad you never get a holiday, and I should like it to
      a&rsquo; done you good. But I thought I might a&rsquo; found a chance o&rsquo; sayin&rsquo; 
      something, something I&rsquo;ve thought of a long time, and that&rsquo;s the honest
      truth. I want to help you and your sister and the young &lsquo;uns, but <i>you</i>
      most of all. I don&rsquo;t like to see you livin&rsquo; such a hard life, &lsquo;cause you
      deserve something better, if ever anyone did. Now will you let me help
      you? There&rsquo;s only one way, and it&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;d like best of any. The long
      an&rsquo; the short of it is, I want to ask you if you&rsquo;ll come an&rsquo; live at the
      &lsquo;ouse, come and bring Mrs. Clay an&rsquo; the children?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma looked at him in surprise and felt uncertain of his meaning, though
      his speech had painfully prepared her with an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d do my right down best to make you a good &lsquo;usband, that I would,
      Emma!&rsquo; Daniel hurried on, getting flustered. &lsquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;ve been a bit too
      sudden? Suppose we leave it till you&rsquo;ve had time to think over? It&rsquo;s no
      good talking to you about money an&rsquo; that kind o&rsquo; thing; you&rsquo;d marry a poor
      man as soon as a rich, if only you cared in the right way for him. I won&rsquo;t
      sing my own praises, but I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d find much to complain of in
      me. I&rsquo;d never ask you to go into the bar, &lsquo;cause I know you ain&rsquo;t suited
      for that, and, what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;d rather you didn&rsquo;t. Will you give it a
      thought?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was modest enough, and from her knowledge of the man Emma felt that he
      was to be trusted for more than his word. But he asked an impossible
      thing. She could not imagine herself consenting to marry any man, but the
      reasons why she could not marry Daniel Dabbs were manifold. She felt them
      all, but it was only needful to think of one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was a temptation, and the hour of it might have been chosen. With a
      scarcity of food for the morrow, with dark fears for her sister, suffering
      incessantly on the children&rsquo;s account, Emma might have been pardoned if
      she had taken the helping hand. But the temptation, though it unsteadied
      her brain for a moment, could never have overcome her. She would have
      deemed it far less a crime to go out and steal a loaf from the baker&rsquo;s
      shop than to marry Daniel because he offered rescue from destitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      She refused him, as gently as she could, but with firmness which left him
      no room for misunderstanding her. Daniel was awed by her quiet sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I can wait,&rsquo; he stammered; &lsquo;if you&rsquo;d take time to think it over?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Useless; the answer could at no time be other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve no call to grumble,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You say straight out what you
      mean. No woman can do fairer than that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His thought recurred for a moment to Alice, whose fault had been that she
      was ever ambiguous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s hard to bear. I don&rsquo;t think I shall ever care to marry any other
      woman. But you&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; the right thing and the honest thing; I wish all
      women was like you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door he turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;d be no harm if I take Mrs. Clay and the children, would there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure they will thank you, Mr. Dabbs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not matter now that there was a clear understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a little distance from the house door Daniel found Mrs. Clay waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No good,&rsquo; he said cheerlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She won&rsquo;t go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. But I&rsquo;ll take you and the children, if you&rsquo;ll come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate did not immediately reply. A grave disappointment showed itself in
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t be helped,&rsquo; Daniel replied to her look. &lsquo;I did my best&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate accepted his invitation, and they arranged the hour of meeting. As
      she approached the house to enter, flow looking ill-tempered, a woman of
      her acquaintance met her. After a few minutes&rsquo; conversation they walked
      away together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma sat up till twelve o&rsquo;clock. The thought on which she was brooding was
      not one to make the time go lightly; it was&mdash;how much and how various
      evil can be wrought by a single act of treachery. And the instance in her
      mind was more fruitful than her knowledge allowed her to perceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate appeared shortly after midnight. She had very red cheeks and very
      bright eyes, and her mood was quarrelsome. She sat down on the bed and
      began to talk of Daniel Dabbs, as she had often done already, in a
      maundering way. Emma kept silence; she was beginning to undress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a man with money,&rsquo; said Kate, her voice getting louder; &lsquo;money, I
      tell you, and you&rsquo;ve only to say a word. And you won&rsquo;t even be civil to
      him. You&rsquo;ve got no feeling; you don&rsquo;t care for nobody but yourself. I&rsquo;ll
      take the children and leave you to go your own way, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hard to make no reply, but Emma succeeded in commanding herself.
      The maundering talk went on for more than an hour. Then came the wretched
      silence of night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma did not sleep. She was too wobegone to find a tear. Life stood before
      her in the darkness like a hideous spectre.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning she told her sister that Daniel had asked her to marry him
      and that she had refused. It was best to have that understood. Kate heard
      with black brows. But even yet she knew something of shame when she
      remembered her return home the night before; it kept her from giving
      utterance to her anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      There followed a scene such as had occurred two or three times during the
      past six months. Emma threw aside all her coldness, and with passionate
      entreaty besought her sister to draw back from the gulf&rsquo;s edge whilst
      there was yet time. For her own sake, for the sake of Bertie and the
      little girl, by the memory of that dear dead one who lay in the waste
      cemetery!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pity me, too! Think a little of me, Kate dear! You are driving me to
      despair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate was moved, she had not else been human. The children were looking up
      with frightened, wondering eyes. She hid her face and muttered promises of
      amendment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma kissed her, and strove hard to hope.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      With his five hundred pounds lodged in the bank, Mutimer felt ill at ease
      in the lodgings in Pentonville. He began to look bout for an abode more
      suitable to the dignity of his position, and shortly discovered a house in
      Holloway, the rent twenty-eight pounds, the situation convenient for his
      purposes. By way of making some amends to Adela for his less than civil
      behaviour, he took the house and had it modestly furnished (at the cost of
      one hundred and ten pounds) before saying anything to her of his plans.
      Then, on the pretext of going to search for pleasanter lodgings, he one
      day took her to Holloway and led her into her own dwelling. Adela was
      startled, but did her best to seem grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned to Pentonville, settled their accounts, packed their
      belongings, and by evening were able to sit down to a dinner cooked by
      their own servant&mdash;under Adela&rsquo;s supervision. Mutimer purchased a
      couple of bottles of claret on the way home, that the first evening might
      be wholly cheerful. Of a sudden he had become a new man; the sullenness
      had passed, and he walked from room to room with much the same air of
      lofty satisfaction as when he first surveyed the interior of Wanley Manor.
      He made a show of reading in the hour before dinner, but could not keep
      still for more than a few minutes at a time; he wanted to handle the
      furniture, to survey the prospect from the windows, to walk out into the
      road and take a general view of the house. When their meal had begun, and
      the servant, instructed to wait at table, chanced to be out of the room,
      he remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll begin, of course, to dine at the proper time again. It&rsquo;s far
      better, don&rsquo;t you think so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I think so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And, by-the-by, you&rsquo;ll see that Mary has a cap.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll see she has.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary herself entered. Some impulse she did not quite understand led Adela
      to look at the girl in her yet capless condition. She said something which
      would require Mary to answer, and found herself wondering at the
      submissive tone, the repeated &lsquo;Mum.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she mused with herself, &lsquo;she is our creature. We pay her and she
      must attire herself to suit our ideas of propriety. She must remember her
      station.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; Mutimer asked, noticing that she had again smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His pipe lit, his limbs reposing in the easy-chair, Mutimer became
      expansive. He requested Adela&rsquo;s attention whilst he rendered a full
      account of all the moneys he had laid out, and made a computation of the
      cost of living on this basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The start once made,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you see it isn&rsquo;t a bit dearer than the
      lodgings. And the fact is, I couldn&rsquo;t have done much in that hole. Now
      here, I feel able to go to work. It isn&rsquo;t in reality spending money on
      ourselves, though it may look like it. You see I must have a place where
      people can call to see me; we&rsquo;d no room before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll write and tell your mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything about the money. You haven&rsquo;t done yet, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Better not That&rsquo;s our own business. You can just say you&rsquo;re more
      comfortable. Of course,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s no secret. I shall let people
      understand in time that I am carrying out the wishes of a Socialist
      friend. That&rsquo;s simple enough. But there&rsquo;s no need to talk about it just
      yet. I must get fairly going first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His face gathered light as he proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, <i>now</i> I&rsquo;ll do something! see if I don&rsquo;t. You see, the fact of
      the matter is, there are some men who are cut out for leading in a
      movement, and I have the kind of feeling&mdash;well, for one thing, I&rsquo;m
      readier at public speaking than most. You think so, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela was sewing together some chintzes. She kept her eyes closely on the
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I think so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now the first thing I shall get done,&rsquo; her husband pursued, a little
      disappointed that she gave no warmer assent, &lsquo;is that book, &ldquo;My Work at
      New Wanley.&rdquo; The Union &lsquo;ll publish it. It ought to have a good sale in
      Belwick and round about there. You see I must get my name well known;
      that&rsquo;s everything. When I&rsquo;ve got that off hand, then I shall begin on the
      East End. I mean to make the East End my own ground. I&rsquo;ll see if something
      can&rsquo;t be done to stir &lsquo;em up. I haven&rsquo;t quite thought it out yet. There
      must be some way of getting them to take an interest in Socialism. Now
      we&rsquo;ll see what can be done in twelve months. What&rsquo;ll you bet me that I
      don&rsquo;t add a thousand members to the Union in this next year?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say you can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no &ldquo;dare say&rdquo; about it. I mean to! I begin to think I&rsquo;ve special
      good luck; things always turn out right in the end. When I lost my work
      because I was a Socialist, then came Wanley. Now I&rsquo;ve lost Wanley, and
      here comes five hundred a year for ten years! I wonder who that poor
      fellow may be? I suppose he&rsquo;ll die soon, and then no doubt we shall hear
      his name. I only wish there were a few more like him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The East End!&rsquo; he resumed presently. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s my ground. I&rsquo;ll make the
      East End know me as well as they know any man in England. What we want is
      personal influence. It&rsquo;s no use asking them to get excited about a <i>movement</i>;
      they must have a <i>man</i>. Just the same in <i>bourgeois</i> politics.
      It isn&rsquo;t Liberalism they care for; it&rsquo;s Gladstone. Wait and see!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked for three hours, at times as if he were already on the platform
      before a crowd of East Enders who were shouting, &lsquo;Mutimer for ever!&rsquo; Adela
      fell into physical weariness; at length she with difficulty kept her eyes
      open. His language was a mere buzzing in her ears; her thoughts were far
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My Work at New Wanley&rsquo; was written and published; Keene had the glory of
      revising the manuscript. It made a pamphlet of thirty-two pages, and was
      in reality an autobiography. It presented the ideal working man; the
      author stood as a type for ever of the noble possibilities inherent in his
      class. Written of course in the first person, it contained passages of
      monumental self-satisfaction. Adela, too, was mentioned; to her horror she
      found a glowing description of the work she had done among the women and
      children. After reading that page she threw the pamphlet aside and hid her
      face in her hands. She longed for the earth to cover her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the publication had no sale worth speaking of. A hundred copies were
      got rid of at the Socialist centres, and a couple of hundred more when the
      price was reduced from twopence to a penny. This would not satisfy
      Mutimer. He took the remaining three hundred off the hands of the Union
      and sowed them broadcast over the East End, where already he was actively
      at work. Then he had a thousand more struck off, and at every meeting
      which he held gave away numerous copies. Keene wrote to suggest that in a
      new edition there should be a woodcut portrait of the author on the front.
      Mutimer was delighted with the idea, and at once had it carried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this winter and the spring that followed he worked hard. It had
      become a necessity of his existence to hear his name on the lips of men,
      to be perpetually in evidence. Adela saw that day by day his personal
      vanity grew more absorbing. When he returned from a meeting he would
      occupy her for hours with a recitation of the speeches he had made, with a
      minute account of what others had said of him. He succeeded in forming a
      new branch of the Union in Clerkenwell, and by contributing half the rent
      obtained a room for meetings. In this branch he was King Mutimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the suit against Rodman was carried through, it could have
      of course but one result. Rodman was sold up; but the profit accruing to
      Hubert Eldon was trifling, for the costs were paid out of the estate, and
      it appeared that Rodman, making hay whilst the sun shone, had spent all
      but the whole of his means. There remained the question whether he was
      making fraudulent concealments. Mutimer was morally convinced that this
      was the case, and would vastly have enjoyed laying his former friend by
      the heels for the statutable six weeks, but satisfactory proofs were not
      to be obtained. Through Mr. Yottle, Eldon expressed the desire that, as
      far as he was concerned, the matter might rest. But it was by no means
      with pure zeal for justice that Mutimer had proceeded thus far. He began
      the suit in anger, and, as is wont to be the case with litigants, grew
      more bitter as it went on. The selling up of Rodman&rsquo;s house was an
      occasion of joy to him; he went about singing and whistling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela marvelled that he could so entirely forget the sufferings of his
      sister; she had had so many proofs of his affection for Alice. In fact he
      was far from forgetting her, but he made strange distinction between her
      and her husband, and had a feeling that in doing his utmost to injure
      Rodman he was in a manner avenging Alice. His love for Alice was in no
      degree weakened, but&mdash;if the state can be understood&mdash;he was
      jealous of the completeness with which she had abandoned him to espouse
      the cause of her husband. Alice had renounced her brother; she never saw
      him, and declared that she never would speak to him again. And Mutimer had
      no fear lest she should suffer want. Rodman had a position of some kind in
      the City; he and his wife lived for a while in lodgings, then took a house
      at Wimbledon.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of Mutimer&rsquo;s greatest anxieties had been lest he should have a
      difficulty henceforth in supporting his mother in the old house. The
      economical plan would have been for Adela and himself to go and live with
      the old woman, but he felt that to be impossible. His mother would never
      become reconciled to Adela, and, if the truth must be told, he was ashamed
      to make known to Adela his mother&rsquo;s excessive homeliness. Then again he
      was still estranged from the old woman. Though he often thought of what
      Alice had said to him on that point, month after month went by and he
      could not make up his mind to go to Wilton Square. Having let the greater
      part of her house, Mrs. Mutimer needed little pecuniary aid; once she
      returned money which he had sent to her &lsquo;Arry still lived with her, and
      &lsquo;Arry was a never-ending difficulty. After his appearance in the police
      court, he retired for a week or two into private life; that is to say, he
      contented himself with loafing about the streets of Hoxton and the City,
      and was at home by eleven o&rsquo;clock nightly, perfectly sober. The character
      of this young man was that of a distinct class, comprising the sons of
      mechanics who are ruined morally by being taught to consider themselves
      above manual labour. Had he from the first been put to a craft, he would
      in all likelihood have been no worse than the ordinary English artisan&mdash;probably
      drinking too much and loafing on Mondays, but not sinking below the level
      of his fellows in the workshop. His positive fault was that shared by his
      brother and sister&mdash;personal vanity. It was encouraged from the
      beginning by immunity from the only kind of work for which he was fitted,
      and the undreamt-of revolution in his prospects gave fatal momentum to all
      his worst tendencies. Keene and Rodman successively did their best, though
      unintentionally, to ruin him. He was now incapable of earning his living
      by any continuous work. Since his return to London he had greatly extended
      his circle of acquaintances, which consisted of idle fellows of the same
      type, youths who hang about the lowest fringe of clerkdom till they
      definitely class themselves either with the criminal community or with
      those who make a living by unrecognised pursuits which at any time may
      chance to bring them within the clutches of the law. To use a coarse but
      expressive word, he was a hopeless blackguard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us be just; &lsquo;Arry had, like every other man, his better moments. He
      knew that he had made himself contemptible to his mother, to Richard, and
      to Alice, and the knowledge was so far from agreeable that it often drove
      him to recklessness. That was his way of doing homage to the better life;
      he had no power of will to resist temptation, but he could go to meet it
      doggedly out of sheer dissatisfaction with himself. Our social state
      ensures destruction to such natures; it has no help for them, no patient
      encouragement. Naturally he hardened himself in vicious habits. Despised
      by his own people, he soothed his injured vanity by winning a certain
      predominance among the contemptible. The fact that he had been on the
      point of inheriting a fortune in itself gave him standing; he told his
      story in public-houses and elsewhere, and relished the distinction of
      having such a story to tell. Even as his brother Richard could not rest
      unless he was prominent as an agitator, so it became a necessity to &lsquo;Arry
      to lead in the gin-palace and the music-hall. He made himself the
      aristocrat of rowdyism.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was impossible to live without ready money, and his mother, though
      supplying him with board and lodging, refused to give him a penny. He made
      efforts on his own account to obtain employment, but without result. At
      last there was nothing for it but to humble himself before Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did it with an ill-enough grace. Early one morning he presented himself
      at the house in Holloway. Richard was talking with his wife in the
      sitting-room, breakfast being still on the table. On the visitor&rsquo;s name
      being brought to him, he sent Adela away and allowed the scapegrace to be
      admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arry shuffled to a seat and sat leaning forward, holding his hat between
      his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what do you want?&rsquo; Richard asked severely. He was glad that &lsquo;Arry
      had at length come, and he enjoyed assuming the magisterial attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to find a place,&rsquo; &lsquo;Arry replied, without looking up, and in a
      dogged voice. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to get one, and I can&rsquo;t. I think you might
      help a feller.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the good of helping you? You&rsquo;ll be turned out of any place in a
      week or two.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What sort of a place do you want?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A clerk&rsquo;s, of course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He pronounced the word &lsquo;clerk&rsquo; as it is spelt; it made him seem yet more
      ignoble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you given up drink?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Before I try to help you,&rsquo; said Mutimer, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll have to take the
      pledge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right!&rsquo; &lsquo;Arry muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a thought occurred to Richard. Bidding his brother stay where he was,
      he went in search of Adela and found her in an upper room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s come to ask me to help him to get a place,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know
      very well how to set about it, but I suppose I must do something. He
      promises to take the pledge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That will be a good thing,&rsquo; Adela replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good if he keeps it. But I can&rsquo;t talk to him; I&rsquo;m sick of doing so. And I
      don&rsquo;t think he even listens to me.&rsquo; He hesitated. &lsquo;Do you think you&mdash;would
      you mind speaking to him? I believe you might do him good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela did not at once reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it&rsquo;s a nasty job,&rsquo; he pursued. &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t ask you if I didn&rsquo;t
      really think you might do some good. I don&rsquo;t see why he should go to the
      dogs. He used to be a good enough fellow when he was a little lad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of the most humane speeches Adela had ever heard from her
      husband. She replied with cheerfulness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you really think he won&rsquo;t take it amiss, I shall be very glad to do my
      best.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right; thank you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela went down and was alone with &lsquo;Arry for half-an-hour. She was young
      to undertake such an office, but suffering had endowed her with gravity
      and understanding beyond her years, and her native sweetness was such that
      she could altogether forget herself in pleading with another for a good
      end. No human being, however perverse, could have taken ill the words that
      were dictated by so pure a mind, and uttered in so musical and gentle a
      voice. She led &lsquo;Arry to speak frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems to me a precious hard thing,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that they&rsquo;ve let Dick
      keep enough money to live on comfortable, and won&rsquo;t give me a penny. My
      right was as good as his.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps it was,&rsquo; Adela replied kindly. &lsquo;But you must remember that money
      was left to your brother by the will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you don&rsquo;t go telling me that he lives on two pounds a week? Everybody
      knows he doesn&rsquo;t. Where does the rest come from?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I must talk about that. I think very likely jour brother
      will explain if you ask him seriously. But is it really such a hard thing
      after all, Harry? I feel so sure that you will only know real happiness
      when you are earning a livelihood by steady and honourable work. You
      remember how I used to go and see the people in New Wanley? I shall never
      forget how happy the best of them were, those who worked their hardest all
      day and at night came home to rest with their families and friends. And
      you yourself, how contented you used to be when your time was thoroughly
      occupied! But I&rsquo;m sure you feel the truth of this. You have been
      disappointed; it has made you a little careless. Now work hard for a year
      and then come and tell me if I wasn&rsquo;t right about that being the way to
      happiness. Will you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose and held her hand to him; the hand to which he should have knelt.
      But he said nothing; there was an obstacle in his throat. Adela understood
      his silence and left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard went to work among his friends, and in a fortnight had found his
      brother employment of a new kind. It was a place in an ironmonger&rsquo;s shop
      in Hoxton; &lsquo;Arry was to serve at the counter and learn the business. For
      three months he was on trial and would receive no salary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of the three months passed, and all seemed to be going well. Then one
      day there came to Mutimer a telegram from &lsquo;Arry&rsquo;s employer; it requested
      that he would go to the shop as soon as possible. Foreseeing some
      catastrophe, he hastened to Hoxton. His brother was in custody for
      stealing money from the till.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ironmonger was inexorable. &lsquo;Arry passed through the judicial routine
      and was sentenced to three months of hard labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in connection with this wretched affair that Richard once more met
      his mother. He went from the shop to tell her what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found her in the kitchen, occupied as he had seen her many, many times,
      ironing newly washed linen. One of the lodgers happened to come out from
      the house as he ascended the steps, so he was able to go down without
      announcing himself. The old woman had a nervous start; the iron stopped in
      its smooth backward and forward motion; the hand with which she held it
      trembled. She kept her eyes on Richard&rsquo;s face, which foretold evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother, I have brought you bad news.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She pushed the iron aside and stood waiting. Her hard lips grew harder;
      her deep-set eyes had a stern light. Not much ill could come to pass for
      which she was not prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to break the news. His mother interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s he been a-doin&rsquo;? You&rsquo;ve no need to go round about. I like
      straightforwardness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard told her. It did not seem to affect her strongly; she turned to
      the table and resumed her work. But she could no longer guide the iron.
      She pushed it aside and faced her son with such a look as one may see in
      the eyes of a weak animal cruelly assailed. Her tongue found its freedom
      and bore her whither it would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did I tell you? What was it I said that night you come in and told
      me you; was all rich? Didn&rsquo;t I warn you that there&rsquo;d no good come of it?
      Didn&rsquo;t I say you&rsquo;d remember my words? You laughed at me; you got
      sharp-tempered with me an as good as called me a fool. An&rsquo; what <i>has</i>
      come of it? What&rsquo;s come of it to me? I had a &lsquo;ome once an&rsquo; children about
      me, an&rsquo; now I&rsquo;ve neither the one nor the other. You call it a &lsquo;ome with
      strangers takin&rsquo; up well nigh all the &lsquo;ouse? Not such a ome as I thought
      to end my days in. It fair scrapes on my heart every time I hear their
      feet going up an&rsquo; down the stairs. An&rsquo; where are my children gone? Two of
      &lsquo;em as &lsquo;ud never think to come near me if it wasn&rsquo;t to bring ill news, an&rsquo; 
      one in prison. How &lsquo;ud that sound in your father&rsquo;s ears, think you? I may
      have been a fool, but I knew what &lsquo;ud come of a workin&rsquo; man&rsquo;s children
      goin&rsquo; to live in big &lsquo;ouses, with their servants an&rsquo; their carriages. What
      better are you? It&rsquo;s come an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s gone, an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s shame an&rsquo; misery left
      be&rsquo;ind it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard listened without irritation; he was heavy-hearted, the shock of
      his brother&rsquo;s disgrace had disposed him to see his life on its dark side.
      And he pitied his poor old mother. She had never been tender in her words,
      could not be tender; but he saw in her countenance the suffering through
      which she had gone, and read grievous things in the eyes that could no
      longer weep. For once he yielded to rebuke. Her complaint that he had not
      come to see her touched him, for he had desired to come, but could not
      subdue his pride. Her voice was feebler than when he last heard it raised
      in reproach; it reminded him that there would come a day when he might
      long to hear even words of upbraiding, but the voice would be mute for
      ever. It needed a moment such as this to stir his sluggish imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What you say is true, mother, but we couldn&rsquo;t help it. It&rsquo;s turned out
      badly because we live in bad times. It&rsquo;s the state of society that&rsquo;s to
      blame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sincere in saying it; that is to say, he used the phrase so
      constantly that it had become his natural utterance in difficulty; it may
      be that in his heart he believed it. Who, indeed, shall say that he was
      wrong? But what made such an excuse so disagreeable in his case was that
      he had not&mdash;intellectually speaking&mdash;the right to avail himself
      of it. The difference between truth and cant often lies only in the lips
      that give forth the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what you always said,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Mutimer impatiently.
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s always someone else as is to blame, an&rsquo; never yourself. The world&rsquo;s
      a good enough world if folk &lsquo;ud only make it so. Was it the bad times as
      made you leave a good, honest girl when you&rsquo;d promised to marry her? No,
      you must have a fine lady for your wife; a plain girl as earnt her own
      bread, an&rsquo; often had hard work to get it, wasn&rsquo;t good enough for you.
      Don&rsquo;t talk to me about bad times. There&rsquo;s some men as does right an&rsquo; some
      as does wrong; it always was so, an&rsquo; the world&rsquo;s no worse nor no better,
      an&rsquo; not likely to be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman could not be generous. A concession only led her on to
      speak the thoughts it naturally suggested to her. And her very bitterness
      was an outcome of her affection; it soothed her to rail at her son after
      so long a silence. He had injured her by his holding aloof; she was urged
      on by this feeling quite as much as by anger with his faults. And still
      Mutimer showed no resentment. In him, too, there was a pleasure which came
      of memories revived. Let her say to him what she liked, he loved his
      mother and was glad to be once more in her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I could have pleased you better, mother,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s done
      can&rsquo;t be helped. We&rsquo;ve trouble to bear together, and it won&rsquo;t be lighter
      for angry words.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman muttered something inaudible and, after feeling her iron and
      discovering that it was cold, she put it down before the fire. Her tongue
      had eased itself, and she fell again into silent grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer sat listening to the tick of the familiar clock. That and the
      smell of the fresh linen made his old life very present to him; there
      arose in his heart a longing for the past, it seemed peaceful and fuller
      of genuine interests than the life he now led. He remembered how he used
      to sit before the kitchen fire reading the books and papers which stirred
      his thought to criticism of the order of things; nothing now absorbed him
      in the same way. Coming across a sentence that delighted him, he used to
      read it aloud to his mother, who perchance was ironing as now, or sewing,
      or preparing a meal, and she would find something to say against it; so
      that there ensued a vigorous debate between her old-fashioned ideas and
      the brand-new theories of the age of education: Then Alice would come in
      and make the dispute a subject for sprightly mockery. Alice was the
      Princess in those days. He quarrelled with her often, but only to resume
      the tone of affectionate banter an hour after. Alice was now Mrs. Rodman,
      and had declared that she hated him, that in her life she would never
      speak to him again. Would it not have been better if things had gone the
      natural course? Alice would no doubt have married Daniel Dabbs, and would
      have made him a good wife, if a rather wilful one. &lsquo;Arry would have given
      trouble, but surely could not have come to hopeless shame. He, Richard,
      would have had Emma Vine for his wife, a true wife, loving him with all
      her heart, thinking him the best and cleverest of working men. Adela did
      not love him; what she thought of his qualities it was not easy to say.
      Yes, the old and natural way was better. He would have had difficulties
      enough, because of his opinions, but at least he would have continued
      truly to represent his class. He knew very well that he did not represent
      it now; he belonged to no class at all; he was a professional agitator,
      and must remain so through his life&mdash;or till the Revolution came. The
      Revolution?...
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother was speaking to him, asking what he meant to do about &lsquo;Arry. He
      raised his eyes, and for a moment looked at her sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be done. I can pay a lawyer, but it&rsquo;ll be no good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained with his mother for yet an hour; they talked intermittently,
      without in appearance coming nearer to each other, though in fact the
      barrier was removed. She made tea for him, and herself made pretence of
      taking some. When he went away he kissed her as he had used to. He left
      her happier than she had been for years, in spite of the news he had
      brought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thenceforward Mutimer went to Wilton Square regularly once a week. He let
      Adela know of this, saying casually one morning that he could not do
      something that day because his mother would expect him in the afternoon as
      usual. He half hoped that she might put some question which would lead to
      talk on the subject, for the reconciliation with his mother had brought
      about a change in his feelings, and it would now have been rather
      agreeable to him to exhibit his beautiful and gentle-mannered wife. But
      Adela merely accepted the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw himself into the work of agitation with more energy than ever. By
      this time he had elaborated a scheme which was original enough to ensure
      him notoriety if only he could advertise it sufficiently throughout the
      East End. He hit upon it one evening when he was smoking his pipe after
      dinner. Adela was in the room with him reading. He took her into his
      confidence at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got it at last! I want something that&rsquo;ll attract their attention. It
      isn&rsquo;t enough to preach theories to them; they won&rsquo;t wake up; there&rsquo;s no
      getting them to feel in earnest about Socialism. I&rsquo;ve been racking my
      brain for something to set them talking, it didn&rsquo;t much matter what, but
      better of course if it was useful in itself at the same time. Now I think
      I&rsquo;ve got it. It&rsquo;s a plan for giving them a personal interest, a money
      interest, in me and my ideas. I&rsquo;ll go and say to them, &ldquo;How is it you men
      never save any money even when you could? I&rsquo;ll tell you: it&rsquo;s because the
      savings would be so little that they don&rsquo;t seem worth while; you think you
      might as well go and enjoy yourselves in the public-house while you can.
      What&rsquo;s the use of laying up a few shillings? The money comes and goes, and
      it&rsquo;s all in a life.&rdquo; Very well, then, I&rsquo;ll put my plan before them. &ldquo;Now
      look here,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;instead of spending so much on beer and spirits,
      come to me and <i>let me keep your money for you</i>!&rdquo; They&rsquo;ll burst out
      laughing at me, and say, &ldquo;Catch us doing that!&rdquo; Yes, but I&rsquo;ll persuade
      them, see if I don&rsquo;t. And in this way. &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s five
      hundred men bring me threepence each every week. Now what man of you
      doesn&rsquo;t spend threepence a week in drink, get the coppers how he may? Do
      you know how much that comes to, five hundred threepenny bits? Why, it&rsquo;s
      six pounds five shillings. And do you know what that comes to in a year?
      Why, no less than three hundred and twenty-five pounds! Now just listen to
      that, and think about it. Those threepenny bits are no use to you; you <i>can&rsquo;t</i>
      save them, and you spend them in a way that does you no good, and it may
      be harm. Now what do you think I&rsquo;ll do with that money? Why, I&rsquo;ll use it
      as the capitalists do. I&rsquo;ll put it out to interest; I&rsquo;ll get three per
      cent. for it, and perhaps more. But let&rsquo;s say three per cent. What&rsquo;s the
      result? Why, this: in one year your three hundred and twenty-five pounds
      has become three hundred and thirty-four pounds fifteen; I owe each of you
      thirteen shillings and fourpence halfpenny, and a fraction more.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had already jotted down calculations, and read from them, looking up
      between times at Adela with the air of conviction which he would address
      to his audience of East Enders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Now if you&rsquo;d only saved the thirteen shillings&mdash;which you wouldn&rsquo;t
      and couldn&rsquo;t have done by yourselves&mdash;it would be well worth the
      while; but you&rsquo;ve got the interest as well, and the point I want you to
      understand is that you can only get that increase by clubbing together and
      investing the savings as a whole. You may say fourpence halfpenny isn&rsquo;t
      worth having. Perhaps not, but those of you who&rsquo;ve learnt arithmetic&mdash;be
      thankful if our social state allowed you to learn anything&mdash;will
      remember that there&rsquo;s such a thing as compound interest. It&rsquo;s a trick the
      capitalists found out. Interest was a good discovery, but compound
      interest a good deal better. Leave your money with me a second year, and
      it&rsquo;ll grow more still, I&rsquo;ll see to that. You&rsquo;re all able, I&rsquo;ve no doubt,
      to make the calculation for yourselves.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused to see what Adela would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt it will be a very good thing if you can persuade them to save in
      that way,&rsquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good, yes; but I&rsquo;m not thinking so much of the money. Don&rsquo;t you see that
      it&rsquo;ll give me a hold over them? Every man who wants to save on my plan
      must join the Union. They&rsquo;ll come together regularly; I can get at them
      and make them listen to me. Why, it&rsquo;s a magnificent idea! It&rsquo;s fighting
      the capitalists with their own weapons! You&rsquo;ll see what the &ldquo;Tocsin&rdquo; &lsquo;ll
      say. Of course they&rsquo;ll make out that I&rsquo;m going against Socialist
      principles. So I am, but it&rsquo;s for the sake of Socialism for all that. If I
      make Socialists, it doesn&rsquo;t much matter how I do it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela could have contested that point, but did not care to do so. She
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you sure you can persuade the men to trust you with their money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the difficulty, I know; but see if I don&rsquo;t get over it. I&rsquo;ll have
      a committee, holding themselves responsible for all sums paid to us. I&rsquo;ll
      publish weekly accounts&mdash;just a leaflet, you know. And do you know
      what? I&rsquo;ll promise that as soon as they&rsquo;ve trusted me with a hundred
      pounds, I&rsquo;ll add another hundred of my own. See if that won&rsquo;t fetch them!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual when he saw a prospect of noisy success he became excited beyond
      measure, and talked incessantly till midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Other men don&rsquo;t have these ideas!&rsquo; he exclaimed at one moment. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
      what I meant when I told you I was born to be a leader. And I&rsquo;ve the
      secret of getting people&rsquo;s confidence. They&rsquo;ll trust me, see if they
      don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of Adela&rsquo;s unbroken reserve, he had seldom been other than
      cordial in his behaviour to her since the recommencement of his
      prosperity. His active life gave him no time to brood over suspicions,
      though his mind was not altogether free from them. He still occasionally
      came home at hours when he could not be expected, but Adela was always
      occupied either with housework or reading, and received him with the cold
      self-possession which came of her understanding his motives. Her life was
      lonely; since a visit they had received from Alfred at the past Christmas
      she had seen no friend. One day in spring Mutimer asked her if she did not
      wish to see Mrs. Westlake; she replied that she had no desire to, and he
      said nothing more. Stella did not write; she had ceased to do so since
      receiving a certain lengthy letter from Adela, in which the latter begged
      that their friendship might feed on silence for a while. When the summer
      came there were pressing invitations from Wanley, but Adela declined them.
      Alfred and his wife were going again to South Wales; was it impossible for
      Adela to join them? Letty wrote a letter full of affectionate pleading,
      but it was useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      In August, Mutimer proposed to take his wife for a week the Sussex coast.
      He wanted a brief rest himself, and he saw that Adela was yet more in need
      of change. She never complained of ill-health, but was weak and pale. With
      no inducement to leave the house, it was much if she had an hour&rsquo;s
      open-air exercise in the week; often the mere exertion of rising and
      beginning the day was followed by a sick languor which compelled her to
      lie all the afternoon on the couch. She studied much, reading English and
      foreign books which required mental exertion. They were rot works relating
      to the &lsquo;Social Question&rsquo;&mdash;far other. The volumes she used to study
      were a burden and a loathing to her as often as her eyes fell upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her letters from Wanley there was never a word of what was going on in
      the valley. Week after week she looked eagerly for some hint, yet was
      relieved when she found none. For it had become her habit to hand over to
      Mutimer every letter she received. He read them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after their return from the seaside, &lsquo;Arry&rsquo;s term of imprisonment
      came to an end. He went to his mother&rsquo;s house, and Richard first saw him
      there. Punishment had had its usual effect; &lsquo;Arry was obstinately
      taciturn, conscious of his degradation, inwardly at war with all his kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing I can do for you now,&rsquo; his brother said to him.
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll pay your passage to Australia. Then you must shift for yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arry refused the offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me the money instead,&rsquo; was his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Argument was vain; Richard and the old woman passed to entreaty, but with
      as little result.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me ten pounds and let me go about my business,&rsquo; &lsquo;Arry exclaimed
      irritably. &lsquo;I want no more from you, and you won&rsquo;t get any good out o&rsquo; me
      by jawin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The money was of course refused, in the hope that a week or two would
      change the poor fellow&rsquo;s mind. But two days after he went out and did not
      return. Nothing was heard of him. Mrs. Mutimer sat late every night,
      listening for a knock at the door. Sometimes she went and stood on the
      steps, looking hither and thither in the darkness. But &lsquo;Arry came no more
      to Wilton Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer had been pressing on his scheme for five months. Every night he
      addressed a meeting somewhere or other in the East End; every Sunday he
      lectured morning and evening at his head-quarters in Clerkenwell.
      Ostensibly he was working on behalf of the Union, but in reality he was
      forming a party of his own, and would have started a paper could he have
      commanded the means. The &lsquo;Tocsin&rsquo; was savagely hostile, the &lsquo;Fiery Gross.&rsquo; 
      grew more and more academical, till it was practically an organ of what is
      called in Germany <i>Katheder-Sozialismus</i>. Those who wrote for it were
      quite distinct from the agitators of the street and of the Socialist
      halls; men&mdash;and women&mdash;with a turn for &lsquo;advanced&rsquo; speculation,
      with anxiety for style. At length the name of the paper was changed, and
      it appeared as the &lsquo;Beacon,&rsquo; adorned with a headpiece by the well-known
      artist, Mr. Boscobel. Mutimer glanced through the pages and flung it aside
      in scornful disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knew what this was coming to,&rsquo; he said to Adela &lsquo;A deal of good <i>they</i>&rsquo;ll
      do! You don&rsquo;t find Socialism in drawing rooms. I wonder that fellow
      Westlake has the impudence to call himself a Socialist at all, living in
      the way he does. Perhaps he thinks he&rsquo;ll be on the safe side when the
      Revolution comes. Ha, ha! We shall see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Revolution.... In the meantime the cry was &lsquo;Democratic Capitalism.&rsquo; 
      That was the name Mutimer gave to his scheme! The &lsquo;Fiery Gross&rsquo; had only
      noticed his work in a brief paragraph, a few words of faint and vague
      praise. &lsquo;Our comrade&rsquo;s noteworthy exertions in the East End.... The gain
      to temperance and self-respecting habits which must surely result....&rsquo; The
      &lsquo;Beacon,&rsquo; however, dealt with the movement more fully, and on the whole in
      a friendly spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Damn their patronage!&rsquo; cried Mutimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should have seen him addressing a crowd collected by chance in Hackney
      or Poplar. The slightest encouragement, even one name to inscribe in the
      book which he carried about with him, was enough to fire his eloquence;
      nay, it was enough to find himself standing on his chair above the heads
      of the gathering. His voice had gained in timbre; he grew more and more
      perfect in his delivery, like a conscientious actor who plays night after
      night in a part that he enjoys. And it was well that he had this inner
      support, this <i>brio</i> of the born demagogue, for often enough he spoke
      under circumstances which would have damped the zeal of any other man. The
      listeners stood with their hands in their pockets, doubting whether to
      hear him to the end or to take their wonted way to the public-house. One
      moment their eyes would be fixed upon him, filmy, unintelligent, then they
      would look at one another with a leer of cunning, or at best a doubtful
      grin. Socialism, forsooth! They were as ready for translation to supernal
      spheres. Yet some of them were attracted: &lsquo;percentage,&rsquo; &lsquo;interest,&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;compound interest,&rsquo; after all, there might be something in this! And
      perhaps they gave their names and their threepenny bits, engaging to make
      the deposit regularly on the day and at the place arranged for in
      Mutimer&rsquo;s elaborate scheme. What is there a man cannot get if he asks for
      it boldly and persistently enough?
    </p>
    <p>
      The year had come full circle; it was time that Mutimer received another
      remittance from his anonymous supporter. He needed it, for he had been
      laying out money without regard to the future. Not only did he need it for
      his own support; already he and his committee held sixty pounds of trust
      money, and before long he might be called upon to fulfil his engagement
      and contribute a hundred pounds&mdash;the promised hundred which had
      elicited more threepences than all the rest of his eloquence. A week, a
      month, six weeks, and he had heard nothing. Then there came one day a
      communication couched in legal terms, signed by a solicitor. It was to the
      effect that his benefactor&mdash;name and address given in full&mdash;had
      just died. The decease was sudden, and though the draft of a will had been
      discovered, it had no signature, and was consequently inoperative. But&mdash;pursued
      the lawyer&mdash;it having been the intention of the deceased to bequeath
      to Mutimer an annuity of five hundred pounds for nine years, the
      administrators were unwilling altogether to neglect their friend&rsquo;s wish,
      and begged to make an offer of the one year&rsquo;s payment which it seemed was
      already due. For more than that they could not hold themselves
      responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before speaking to Adela, Mutimer made searching inquiries. He went to the
      Midland town where his benefactor had lived, and was only too well
      satisfied of the truth of what had been told him. He came back with his
      final five hundred pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he informed his wife of what had befallen. He was not cheerful, but
      with five hundred pounds in his pocket he could not be altogether
      depressed. What might not happen in a year? He was becoming prominent;
      there had been mention of him lately in London journals. Pooh! as if he
      would ever really want!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The great thing,&rsquo; he exclaimed, &lsquo;is that I can lay down the hundred
      pounds! If I&rsquo;d failed in that it would have been all up. Come, now, why
      can&rsquo;t you give me a bit of encouragement, Adela? I tell you what it is.
      There&rsquo;s no place where I&rsquo;m thought so little of as in my own home, and
      that&rsquo;s a fact.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not worship him, she made no pretence of it. Her cold, pale beauty
      had not so much power over him as formerly, but it still chagrined him
      keenly as often as he was reminded that he had no high place in his wife&rsquo;s
      judgment. He knew well enough that it was impossible for her to: admire
      him; he was conscious of the thousand degrading things he had said and
      done, every one of them stored in her memory. Perhaps not once since that
      terrible day in the Pentonville lodgings had he looked her straight in the
      eyes. Yes, her beauty appealed to him less than even a year ago; Adela
      knew it, and it was the one solace in her living death. Perhaps occasion
      could again have stung him into jealousy, but Adela was no longer a vital
      interest in his existence. He lived in external things, his natural life.
      Passion had been an irregularity in his development. Yet he would gladly
      have had his wife&rsquo;s sympathy. He neither loved nor hated her, but she was
      for ever above him, and, however unconsciously, he longed for her regard.
      Irreproachable, reticent, it might be dying, Adela would no longer affect
      interests she did not feel. To these present words of his she replied only
      with a grave, not unkind, look; a look he could not under stand, yet which
      humbled rather than irritated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant opened the door and announced a visitor&mdash;&lsquo;Mr. Hilary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer seemed struck with a thought as he heard the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The very man!&rsquo; he exclaimed below his breath, with a glance at Adela.
      &lsquo;Just run off and let us have this room. My luck won&rsquo;t desert me, see if
      it does!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Willis Rodman scarcely relished the process which deprived him of his
      town house and of the greater part of his means, but his exasperation
      happily did not seek vent for itself in cruelty to his wife. It might very
      well have done so, would all but certainly, had not Alice appealed to his
      sense of humour by her zeal in espousing his cause against her brother.
      That he could turn her round his finger was an old experience, but to see
      her spring so actively to arms on his behalf, when he was conscious that
      she had every excuse for detesting him, and even abandoning him, struck
      him as a highly comical instance of his power over women, a power on which
      he had always prided himself. He could not even explain it as
      self-interest in her; numberless things proved the contrary. Alice was
      still his slave, though he had not given himself the slightest trouble to
      preserve even her respect. He had shown himself to her freely as he was,
      jocosely cynical on everything that women prize, brutal when he chose to
      give way to his temper, faithless on principle, selfish to the core;
      perhaps the secret of the fascination he exercised over her was his very
      ingenuousness, his boldness in defying fortune, his clever grasp of
      circumstances. She said to him one day, when he had been telling her that
      as likely as not she might have to take in washing or set up a
      sewing-machine:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not afraid. You can always get money. There&rsquo;s nothing you can&rsquo;t do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That may be true. But how if I disappear some day and leave you to take
      care of yourself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had often threatened this in his genial way, and it never failed to
      blanch her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you do that,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I shall kill myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At which he laughed yet more loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her house at Wimbledon she perished of <i>ennui</i>, for she was as
      lonely as Adela in Holloway. Much lonelier; she had no resources in
      herself. Rodman was away all day in London, and very often he did not
      return at night; when the latter was the case, Alice cried miserably in
      her bed for hours, so that the next morning her face was like that of a
      wax doll that has suffered ill-usage. She had an endless supply of novels,
      and day after day bent over them till her head ached. Poor Princess! She
      had had her own romance, in its way brilliant and strange enough, but only
      the rags of it were left. She clung to them, she hoped against hope that
      they would yet recover their gloss and shimmer. If only he would not so
      neglect her! All else affected her but little now that she really knew
      what it meant to see her husband utterly careless, not to be held by any
      pettings or entreaties. She heard through him of her brother &lsquo;Arry&rsquo;s
      disgrace; it scarcely touched her. Her brother Richard she was never tired
      of railing against, railed so much, indeed, that it showed she by no means
      hated him as much as she declared. But nothing would have mattered if only
      her husband had cared for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had once said to Adela that she disliked children and hoped never to
      have any. It was now her despair that she remained childless. Perhaps that
      was why he had lost all affection?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the summer Rodman once quitted her for nearly three weeks, during which
      she only heard from him once. He was in Ireland, and, he asserted, on
      business. The famous &lsquo;Irish Dairy Company,&rsquo; soon to occupy a share of
      public attention, was getting itself on foot. It was Rodman who promoted
      the company and who became its secretary, though the name of that
      functionary in all printed matter appeared as &lsquo;Robert Delancey.&rsquo; However,
      I only mention it for the present to explain our friend&rsquo;s absence in
      Ireland. Alice often worked herself up to a pitch of terror lest her
      husband had fulfilled his threat and really deserted her. He returned when
      it suited him to do so, and tortured her with a story of a wealthy Irish
      widow who had fallen desperately in love with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I&rsquo;ve a good mind to marry her,&rsquo; he added with an air of serious
      reflection. Of course I didn&rsquo;t let her know my real name. I could manage
      it very nicely, and you would never know anything about it; I should remit
      you all the money you wanted, you needn&rsquo;t be afraid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice tried to assume a face of stony indignation, but as usual she ended
      by breaking down and shedding tears. Then he told her that she was getting
      plainer than ever, and that it all came of her perpetual &lsquo;water-works.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice hit upon a brilliant idea. What if she endeavoured to make him
      jealous? In spite of her entreaties, he never would take her to town,
      though he saw that she was perishing for lack of amusement. Suppose she
      made him believe that she had gone on her own account, and at the
      invitation of someone whose name she would not divulge? I believe she
      found the trick in one of her novels. The poor child went to work most
      conscientiously. One morning when he came down to breakfast she pretended
      to have been reading a letter, crushed an old envelope into her pocket on
      his entering the room, and affected confusion. He observed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Had a letter?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes&mdash;no. Nothing of any importance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled and applied himself to the ham, then left her in his ordinary
      way, without a word of courtesy, and went to town. She had asked him
      particularly when he should be back that night He named the train, which
      reached Wimbledon a little after ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had only one servant. Alice took the girl into her confidence, said
      she was going to play a trick, and it must not be spoilt. By ten o&rsquo;clock
      at night she was dressed for going out, and when she heard her husband&rsquo;s
      latch-key at the front door she slipped out at the back. It was her plan
      to walk about the roads for half an hour, then to enter and&mdash;make the
      best of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodman, unable to find his wife, summoned the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is your mistress?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Out, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He examined the girl shrewdly, with his eyes and with words. It was
      perfectly true that women&mdash;of a kind&mdash;could not resist him. In
      the end he discovered exactly what had happened. He laughed his wonted
      laugh of cynical merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go to bed,&rsquo; he said to the servant. &lsquo;And if you hear anyone at the door,
      pay no attention.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he locked up the house, front and back, and, having extinguished all
      lights except a small lantern by which he could read in the sitting-room
      without danger of its being discerned from outside, sat down with a sense
      of amusement. Presently there came a ring at the bell; it was repeated
      again and again. The month was October, the night decidedly cool. Rodman
      chuckled to himself; he had a steaming glass of whisky before him and
      sipped it delicately. The ringing continued for a quarter of an hour, then
      five minutes passed, and no sound came. Rodman stepped lightly to the
      front door, listened, heard nothing, unlocked and opened. Alice was
      standing in the middle of the road, her hands crossed over her breast and
      holding her shoulders as though she suffered from the cold. She came
      forward and entered the house without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sitting-room she found the lantern and looked at her husband in
      surprise. His face was stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rsquo; he asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been to London,&rsquo; she answered, her teeth chattering with cold and
      her voice uncertain from fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Been to London? And what business had you to go without telling me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke savagely. Alice was sinking with dread, but even yet had
      sufficient resolve to keep up the comedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had an invitation. I don&rsquo;t see why I shouldn&rsquo;t go. I don&rsquo;t ask you who
      you go about with.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The table was laid for supper. Rodman darted to it, seized a
      carving-knife, and in an instant was holding it to her throat. She
      shrieked and fell upon her knees, her face ghastly with mortal terror.
      Then Rodman burst out laughing and showed that his anger had been feigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had barely strength to rise, but at length stood before him trembling
      and sobbing, unable to believe that he had not been in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t explain the trick,&rsquo; he said, with the appearance of great
      good-humour, &lsquo;but just tell me why you played it. Did you think I should
      believe you were up to something queer, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must think what you like,&rsquo; she sobbed, utterly humiliated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He roared with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a splendid idea! The Princess getting tired of propriety and making
      appointments in London! Little fool! do you think I should care one straw?
      Why shouldn&rsquo;t you amuse yourself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice looked at him with eyes of wondering misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean that you don&rsquo;t care enough for me to&mdash;to&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t care one farthing&rsquo;s worth! And to think you went and walked about
      in the mud and the east wind! Well, if that isn&rsquo;t the best joke I ever
      heard! I&rsquo;ll have a rare laugh over this story with some men I know
      to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She crept away to her bedroom. He had gone far towards killing the love
      that had known no rival in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bantered her ceaselessly through breakfast next morning, and for the
      first time she could find no word to reply to him. Her head drooped; she
      touched nothing on the table. Before going off he asked her what the
      appointment was for to-day, and advised her not to forget her latch-key.
      Alice scarcely heard him, she was shame-stricken and wobegone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodman, on the other hand, had never been in better spirits. The &lsquo;Irish
      Dairy Company&rsquo; was attracting purchasers of shares. It was the kind of
      scheme which easily recommended itself to a host of the foolish people who
      are ever ready to risk their money, also to some not quite so foolish. The
      prospectus could show some respectable names: one or two Irish lords, a
      member of Parliament, some known capitalists. The profits could not but be
      considerable, and think of the good to &lsquo;the unhappy sister country&rsquo;&mdash;as
      the circular said. Butter, cheese, eggs of unassailable genuineness, to be
      sold in England at absurdly low prices, yet still putting the producers on
      a footing of comfort and proud independence. One of the best ideas that
      had yet occurred to Mr. Robert Delancey.
    </p>
    <p>
      He&mdash;the said Mr. Delancey, <i>alias</i> Mr. Willis Rodman, <i>alias</i>
      certain other names&mdash;spent much of his time just now in the society
      of a Mr. Hilary, a gentleman who, like himself, had seen men and manners
      in various quarters of the globe, and was at present making a tolerable
      income by the profession of philanthropy. Mr. Hilary&rsquo;s name appeared among
      the directors of the company; it gave confidence to many who were familiar
      with it in connection with not a few enterprises started for the benefit
      of this or that depressed nationality, this or the other exploited class.
      He wrote frequently to the newspapers on the most various subjects; he was
      known to members of Parliament through his persistent endeavours to obtain
      legislation with regard to certain manufactures proved to be gravely
      deleterious to the health of those employed in them. To-day Mr. Delancey
      and Mr. Hilary passed some hours together in the latter&rsquo;s chambers. Their
      talk was of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you saw Mutimer about it?&rsquo; Rodman asked, turning to a detail in which
      he was specially interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. He is anxious to have shares.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hilary was a man of past middle age, long-bearded, somewhat cadaverous
      of hue. His head was venerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were careful not to mention me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I kept your caution in mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Their tone to each other was one of perfect gravity. Mr. Hilary even went
      out of his way to choose becoming phrases.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t have anything to do with it if he gets to know who R. Delancey
      is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was prudent, believe me. I laid before him the aspects of the
      undertaking which would especially interest him. I made it clear to him
      that our enterprise is no less one of social than of commercial
      importance; he entered into our views very heartily. The first time I saw
      him, I merely invited him to glance over our prospectus; yesterday he was
      more than willing to join our association&mdash;and share our profits.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did he tell you how much he&rsquo;d got out of those poor devils over there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A matter of sixty pounds, I gathered. I am not a little astonished at his
      success.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, he&rsquo;d talk the devil himself into subscribing to a mission if it
      suited him to try.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is clearly very anxious to get the highest interest possible for his
      money. His ideas on business seemed, I confess, rather vague. I did my
      best to help him with suggestions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He talked of taking some five hundred pounds&rsquo; worth of shares on his own
      account.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The men regarded each other. Rodman&rsquo;s lips curled; Mr. Hilary was as grave
      as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t balk him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I commended his discretion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodman could not check a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am serious,&rsquo; said Mr. Hilary. &lsquo;It may take a little time, but&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just so. Did he question you at all about what we were doing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A good deal. He said he should go and look over the Stores in the
      Strand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By all means. He&rsquo;s a clever man if he distinguishes between Irish butter
      and English butterine&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure I couldn&rsquo;t. And things really are
      looking up at the Stores?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, distinctly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By-the-by, I had rather a nasty letter from Lord Mountorry yesterday.
      He&rsquo;s beginning to ask questions: wants to know when we&rsquo;re going to
      conclude our contract with that tenant of his&mdash;I&rsquo;ve forgotten the
      fellow&rsquo;s name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, that must be looked into. There&rsquo;s perhaps no reason why the
      contract should not be concluded. Little by little we may come to justify
      our name; who knows? In the meantime, we at all events do a <i>bona fide</i>
      business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Strictly so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodman had a good deal of business on hand besides that which arose from
      his connection with Irish dairies. If Alice imagined him strolling at his
      ease about the fashionable lounges of the town, she was much mistaken. He
      worked hard and enjoyed his work, on the sole condition that he was
      engaged in overreaching someone. This flattered his humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not find leisure to dine till nearly nine o&rsquo;clock. He had made up
      his mind not to return to Wimbledon, but to make use of a certain <i>pied-a-terre</i>
      which he had in Pimlico. His day&rsquo;s work ended in Westminster, he dined at
      a restaurant with a friend. Afterwards billiards were proposed. They
      entered a house which Rodman did not know, and were passing before the bar
      to go to the billiard-room, when a man who stood there taking refreshment
      called out, &lsquo;Hollo, Rodman!&rsquo; To announce a man&rsquo;s name in this way is a
      decided breach of etiquette in the world to which Rodman belonged. He
      looked annoyed, and would have passed on, but his acquaintance, who had
      perhaps exceeded the limits of modest refreshment, called him again and
      obliged him to approach the bar. As he did so Rodman happened to glance at
      the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order. The glance was
      followed by a short but close scrutiny, after which he turned his back and
      endeavoured by a sign to draw his two acquaintances away. But at the same
      moment the barmaid addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is yours, Mr. Rodman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders, muttered a strong expression, and turned round
      again. The woman met his look steadily. She was perhaps thirty, rather
      tall, with features more refined than her position would have led one to
      expect. Her figure was good but meagre; her cheeks were very thin, and the
      expression of her face, not quite amiable at any time, was at present
      almost fierce. She seemed about to say something further, but restrained
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodman recovered his good temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do, Clara?&rsquo; he said, keeping his eye fixed on hers. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have a drop
      of absinthe, if you please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he pursued his conversation with the two men. The woman, having
      served them, disappeared. Rodman kept looking for her. In a few minutes he
      pretended to recollect an engagement and succeeded in going off alone. As
      he issued on to the pavement he found himself confronted by the barmaid,
      who now wore a hat and cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; he said, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rodman&rsquo;s your name, is it?&rsquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To my particular friends. Let&rsquo;s walk on; we can&rsquo;t chat here very well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is to prevent me from calling that policeman and giving you in
      charge?&rsquo; she asked, looking into his face with a strange mixture of
      curiosity and anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing, except that you have no charge to make against me. The law isn&rsquo;t
      so obliging as all that. Come, we&rsquo;ll take a walk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved along by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You coward!&rsquo; she exclaimed, passionately but with none of the shrieking
      virulence of women who like to make a scene in the street. &lsquo;You mean,
      contemptible, cold-blooded man! I suppose you hoped I was starved to death
      by this time, or in the workhouse, or&mdash;what did <i>you</i> care where
      I was! I knew I should find you some day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I rather supposed you would stay on the other side of the water,&rsquo; Rodman
      remarked, glancing at her. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re changed a good deal. Now it&rsquo;s a most
      extraordinary thing. Not so very long ago I was dreaming about you, and
      you were serving at a bar&mdash;queer thing, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were walking towards Whitehall. When they came at length into an
      ill-lighted and quiet spot, the woman stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where do you live?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Live? Oh, just out here in Pimlico. Like to see my rooms?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean by talking to me like that? Do you make a joke of
      deserting your wife and child for seven years, leaving them without a
      penny, going about enjoying yourself, when, for anything you knew, they
      were begging their bread? You always were heartless&mdash;it was the
      blackest day of my life that I met you; and you ask me if I&rsquo;d like to see
      your rooms! What thanks to you that I&rsquo;m not as vile a creature as there is
      in London? How was I to support myself and the child? What was I to do
      when they turned me into the streets of New York because I couldn&rsquo;t pay
      what you owed them nor the rent of a room to sleep in? You took good care
      <i>you</i> never went hungry. I&rsquo;d only one thing to hold me up: I was an
      honest woman, and I made up my mind I&rsquo;d keep honest, though I had such a
      man as you for my husband. I&rsquo;ve hungered and worked, and I&rsquo;ve made a
      living for myself and my child as best I could. I&rsquo;m not like you: I&rsquo;ve
      done nothing to disgrace myself. Now I will slave no more. You won&rsquo;t run
      away from me this time. Leave me for a single night, and I go to the
      nearest police-station and tell all I know about you. If I wasn&rsquo;t a fool
      I&rsquo;d do it now. But I&rsquo;ve hungered and worked for seven years, and now it&rsquo;s
      time <i>my husband</i> did something for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You always had a head for argument, Clara,&rsquo; he replied coolly. &lsquo;But I
      can&rsquo;t get over that dream of mine. Really a queer thing, wasn&rsquo;t it? Who&rsquo;d
      have thought of you turning barmaid? With your education, I should have
      thought you could have done something in the teaching line. Never mind.
      The queerest thing of all is that I&rsquo;m really half glad to see you. How&rsquo;s
      Jack?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The extraordinary conversation went on as they walked towards the street
      where Clara lived. It was in a poor part of Westminster. Reaching the
      house, Clara opened the door with a latchkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two women were standing in the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is my husband, Mrs. Rook,&rsquo; Clara said to one of them. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s just got
      back from abroad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Glad to see you, Mr. Williamson,&rsquo; said the landlady, scrutinising him
      with unmistakable suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pair ascended the stairs, and Mrs. Williamson&mdash;she had always
      used the name she received in marriage&mdash;opened a door which disclosed
      a dark bedroom. A voice came from within&mdash;the voice of a little lad
      of eight years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That you, mother? Why, I&rsquo;ve only just put myself to bed. What time is
      it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you ought to have gone to bed long ago,&rsquo; replied his mother whilst
      she was striking a light.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very small room, but decent. The boy was discovered sitting up in
      bed&mdash;a bright-faced little fellow with black hair. Clara closed the
      door, then turned and looked at her husband. The light made a glistening
      appearance on her eyes; she had become silent, allowing facts to speak for
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child stared at the stranger in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; he asked at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodman laughed as heartily as if there had been nothing disagreeable in
      the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have the honour to be your father, sir,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a fine
      boy, Jack&mdash;a deuced fine boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The child was speechless. Rodman turned to the mother. Her hands held the
      rail at the foot of the bed, and as the boy looked up at her for
      explanation she let her face fall upon them and sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re father come back,&rsquo; exclaimed Jack indignantly, &lsquo;why do you make
      mother cry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodman was still mirthful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I like you, Jack,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll make a man some day. Do you mind if I
      smoke a cigar, Clara?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To his astonishment, he felt a weakness which had to be resisted; tobacco
      suggested itself as a resource. When he had struck a light, his wife
      forced back her tears and seated herself with an unforgiving countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodman began to chat pleasantly as he smoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decidedly it was a <i>contretemps</i>. It introduced a number of
      difficulties into his life. If he remained away for a night, he had little
      doubt that his wife would denounce him; she knew of several little matters
      which he on the whole preferred to be reticent about. She was not a woman
      like Alice, to be turned round his finger. It behoved him to be
      exceedingly cautious.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had three personalities. As Mr. Willis Rodman his task was
      comparatively a light one, at all events for the present. He merely
      informed Alice by letter that he was kept in town by business and would
      see her in the course of a week. It was very convenient that Alice had no
      intercourse with her relatives. Secondly, as Mr. Williamson his position
      was somewhat more difficult. Not only had he to present himself every
      night at the rooms he had taken in Brixton, but it was necessary to take
      precautions lest his abode should be discovered by those who might make
      awkward use of the knowledge. He had, moreover, to keep Clara in the dark
      as to his real occupations and prevent her from knowing his resorts in
      town. Lastly, as Mr. Robert Delancey he had to deal with matters of a very
      delicate nature indeed, in themselves quite enough to occupy a man&rsquo;s
      mental energy. But our friend was no ordinary man. If you are not as yet
      satisfied of that, it will ere long be made abundantly clear to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      His spirits were as high as ever. When he said&mdash;with an ingenious
      brutality all his own&mdash;that he was more than half glad to see his
      wife, he, for a wonder, told the truth. But perhaps it was little Jack who
      gave him most pleasure, and did most to reconcile him to the difficulties
      of his situation. In a day or two be conquered the child&rsquo;s affections so
      completely that Jack seemed to care little for his mother in comparison;
      Jack could not know the hardships she had endured for his sake. Rodman&mdash;so
      we will continue to call him for convenience&rsquo; sake&mdash;already began to
      talk of what he would make the lad, who certainly gave promise of parts.
      The result of this was that for a week or two our friend became an
      exemplary family man. His wife almost dared to believe that her miseries
      were over. Yet she watched him with lynx eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &lsquo;Irish Dairy Company&rsquo; flourished. Rodman rubbed his hands with a
      sinister satisfaction when he inscribed among the shareholders the name of
      Richard Mutimer, who invested all the money he had collected from the
      East-Enders, and three hundred pounds of his own&mdash;not five hundred,
      as he had at first thought of doing. Mutimer had the consent of his
      committee, whom he persuaded without much difficulty&mdash;the money was
      not theirs&mdash;that by this means he would increase his capital beyond
      all expectation. He told Adela what he had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s not the least risk. They&rsquo;ve got the names of several lords! And
      it isn&rsquo;t a mere commercial undertaking: the first object is to benefit the
      Irish; so that there can be nothing against my principles in it. They
      promise a dividend of thirty per cent. What a glorious day it will be when
      I tell the people what I have made of their money! Now confess that it
      isn&rsquo;t everyone could have hit on this idea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course he made no public announcement of his speculation: that would
      have been to spoil the surprise. But he could not refrain from talking a
      good deal about the Company to his friends. He explained with zeal the
      merit of the scheme; it was dealing directly with the producers, the poor
      small-farmers who could never get fair treatment. He saw a great deal of
      Mr. Hilary, who was vastly interested in his East-End work. A severe
      winter had begun. Threepenny bits came in now but slowly, and Mutimer
      exerted himself earnestly to relieve the growing want in what he called
      his &lsquo;parishes.&rsquo; He began in truth to do some really good work, moving
      heaven and earth to find employment for those long out of it, and even
      bestowing money of his own. At night he would return to Holloway worn out,
      and distress Adela with descriptions of the misery he had witnessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not sorry for it,&rsquo; he once exclaimed. &lsquo;I cannot be sorry. Let things
      get worse and worse the mending&rsquo;ll be all the nearer. Why don&rsquo;t they march
      in a body to the West End? I don&rsquo;t mean march in a violent sense, though
      that&rsquo;ll have to come, I expect. But why don&rsquo;t they make a huge procession
      and go about the streets in an orderly way&mdash;just to let it be seen
      what their numbers are&mdash;just to give the West End a hint? I&rsquo;ll
      propose that one of these days. It&rsquo;ll be a risky business, but we can&rsquo;t
      think of that when thousands are half starving. I could lead them, I feel
      sure I could! It wants someone with authority over them, and I think I&rsquo;ve
      got that. There&rsquo;s no telling what I may do yet. I say, Adela, bow would it
      sound&mdash;&ldquo;Richard Mutimer, First President of the English Republic&rdquo;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the meantime Alice sat in her house at Wimbledon, abandoned. The
      solitude seemed to be driving her mad. Rodman came down very occasionally
      for a few hours in the daytime, but never passed a night with her. He told
      her he had a great affair on hand, a very great affair, which was to make
      their fortunes ten times over. She must be patient; women couldn&rsquo;t
      understand business. If she resisted his coaxing and grumbled, he always
      had his threat ready. He would realise his profits and make off, leaving
      her in the lurch. Weeks became months. In pique at the betrayal of her
      famous stratagem, Alice had wanted to dismiss her servant, but Rodman
      objected to this. She was driven by desperation to swallow her pride and
      make a companion of the girl. But she did not complain to her of her
      husband&mdash;partly out of self-respect, partly because she was afraid
      to. Indeed it was a terrible time for the poor Princess. She spent the
      greater part of every day in a state of apathy; for the rest she wept.
      Many a time she was on the point of writing to Richard, but could not
      quite bring herself to that. She could not leave the house, for it rained
      or snowed day after day; the sun seemed to have deserted the heavens as
      completely as joy her life. She grew feeble-minded, tried to amuse herself
      with childish games, played &lsquo;Beggar My Neighbour&rsquo; with the servant for
      hours at night. She had fits of hysteria, and terrified her sole companion
      with senseless laughter, or with alarming screams. Reading she was no
      longer story. And her glass&mdash;as well as her husband&mdash;told her
      that equal to; after a few pages she lost her understanding of a she
      suffered daily in her appearance. Her hair was falling; she one day told
      the servant that she would soon have to buy a wig. Poor Alice! And she had
      not even the resource of railing against the social state. What a pity she
      had never studied that subject!
    </p>
    <p>
      So the time went on till February of the new year. Alice&rsquo;s release was at
      hand.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arry Mutimer, not long after he left his mother&rsquo;s house for good, by
      chance met Rodman in the City. Presuming on old acquaintance, he accosted
      the man of business with some familiarity; it was a chance of getting
      much-needed assistance once more. But Rodman was not disposed to renew the
      association He looked into &lsquo;Arry&rsquo;s face with a blank stare, asked
      contemptuously, &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; and pursued his walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arry hoped that he might some day have a chance of being even with Mr.
      Rodman.
    </p>
    <p>
      As indeed he had. One evening towards the end of February, &lsquo;Arry was
      loafing about Brixton. He knew a certain licensed victualler in those
      parts, a man who had ere now given him casual employment, and after a day
      of fasting he trudged southwards to see if his friend would not at all
      events be good for a glass of beer and a hunch of bread and cheese.
      Perhaps he might also supply the coppers to pay for a bed in the New Cut.
      To his great disappointment, the worthy victualler was away from home; the
      victualler&rsquo;s wife had no charitable tendencies. &lsquo;Arry whined to her, but
      only got for an answer that times was as &lsquo;ard with her as with anyone
      else. The representative of unemployed labour went his way despondently,
      hands thrust deep in pockets, head slouching forwards, shoulders high up
      against the night blast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was passing a chemist&rsquo;s shop, when a customer came out He recognised
      Rodman. After a moment&rsquo;s uncertainty he made up his mind to follow him,
      wondering how Rodman came to be in this part of London. Keeping at a
      cautious distance, he saw him stop at a small house and enter it by aid of
      a latchkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, he lives there!&rsquo; &lsquo;Arry exclaimed to himself. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the meanin&rsquo; o&rsquo; 
      this go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodman, after all, had seriously come down in the world, then. It occurred
      to &lsquo;Arry that he might do worse than pay his sister a visit; Alice could
      not be hard-hearted enough to refuse him a few coppers. But the call must
      be made at an hour when Rodman was away. Presumably that would be some
      time after eight in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our unconventional friend walked many miles that night. It was one way of
      keeping warm, and there was always a possibility of aid from one or other
      of the acquaintances whom he sought. The net result of the night&rsquo;s
      campaign was half-a-pint of &lsquo;four-half.&rsquo; The front of a draper&rsquo;s shop in
      Kennington tempted him sorely; he passed it many times, eyeing the rolls
      of calico and flannel exposed just outside the doorway. But either courage
      failed him or there was no really good opportunity. Midnight found him
      still without means of retiring to that familiar lodging in the New Cut.
      At half-past twelve sleet began to fall. He discovered a very dark corner
      of a very dark slum, curled himself against the wall, and slept for a few
      hours in defiance of wind and weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arry was used to this kind of thing. On the whole he deemed it preferable
      to the life he would have led at his mother&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      By eight o&rsquo;clock next morning he was back in Brixton, standing just where
      he could see the house which Rodman had entered, without himself
      attracting attention. Every rag on his back was soaked; he had not eaten a
      mouthful for thirty hours. After such a run of bad luck perhaps something
      was about to turn up.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was ten o&rsquo;clock before Rodman left home. &lsquo;Arry had no feeling left
      in any particle of his body. Still here at length was the opportunity of
      seeing Alice. He waited till Rodman was out of sight, then went to the
      door and knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Clara who opened the door. Seeing &lsquo;Arry, she took him for a beggar,
      shook her head, and was closing the door against him, when she heard&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Mrs. Rodman in, mum?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs.&mdash;who?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Rodman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara&rsquo;s eyes flashed as they searched his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you want with Mrs. Rodman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Want to see her, mum.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know her when you see her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sh&rsquo; think I do,&rsquo; replied &lsquo;Arry with a grin. But he thought it prudent to
      refrain from explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you know she lives here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Cause I just see her &lsquo;usband go out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara hesitated a moment, then bade him enter. She introduced him to a
      parlour on the ground floor. He stood looking uneasily about him. The
      habits of his life made him at all times suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Rodman doesn&rsquo;t live here,&rsquo; Clara began, lowering her voice and
      making a great effort to steady it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, she don&rsquo;t?&rsquo; replied &lsquo;Arry, beginning to discern that something was
      wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you tell me what you want with her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked her in the eyes and again grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dare say I could if it was made worth my while.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a purse from her pocket and laid half-a-crown on the table. Her
      hand shook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t afford more than that. You shall have it if you tell me the
      truth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arry took counsel with himself for an instant. Probably there was no more
      to be got, and he saw from the woman&rsquo;s agitation that he had come upon
      some mystery. The chance of injuring Rodman was more to him than several
      half-crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t ask more,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;if you&rsquo;ll tell me who <i>you</i> are. That&rsquo;s
      fair on both sides, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My name is Mrs. Williamson.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh? And might it &lsquo;appen that Mr. Rodman calls himself Mr. Williamson when
      it suits him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rsquo; she replied hurriedly. &lsquo;Tell me who it is
      you call Mrs. Rodman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>call</i> her so. That&rsquo;s her married name. She&rsquo;s my sister.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened. Both turned their heads and saw Rodman. He had come back
      for a letter he had forgotten to take with him to post At a glance he saw
      everything, including the half-crown on the table, which &lsquo;Arry instantly
      seized. He walked forward, throwing a murderous look at Clara as he passed
      her. Then he said to &lsquo;Arry, in a perfectly calm voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the door.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see there is,&rsquo; the other replied, grinning. &lsquo;Good-mornin&rsquo;, Mr. Rodman
      Williamson.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Husband and wife faced each other as soon as the front door slammed. Clara
      was a tigress; she could not be terrified as Alice might have been by
      scowls and savage threats. Rodman knew it, and knew, moreover, that his
      position was more perilous than any he had been in for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you know?&rsquo; he asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Enough to send you to prison, Mr. Rodman. You can&rsquo;t do <i>quite</i> what
      you like! If there&rsquo;s law in this country I&rsquo;ll see you punished!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He let her rave for a minute or two, and by that time had laid his plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you let me speak? Now I give you a choice. Either you can do as you
      say, or you can be out of this country, with me and Jack, before to-morrow
      morning. In a couple of hours I can get more money than you ever set eyes
      on; I&rsquo;ll be back here with it&rsquo;&mdash;he looked at his watch&mdash;&lsquo;by one
      o&rsquo;clock. No, that wouldn&rsquo;t be safe either&mdash;that fellow might send
      someone here by then. I&rsquo;ll meet you on Westminster Bridge, the north end,
      at one. Now you&rsquo;ve a minute to choose; he may have gone straight away to
      the police station. Punish me if you like&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care a curse. But
      it seems to me the other thing&rsquo;s got more common sense in it I haven&rsquo;t
      seen that woman for a month, and never care to see her again. I don&rsquo;t care
      over much for you either; but I do care for Jack, and for his sake I&rsquo;ll
      take you with me, and do my best for you. It&rsquo;s no good looking at me like
      a wild beast You&rsquo;ve sense enough to make a choice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She clasped her hands together and moaned, so dreadful was the struggle in
      her between passions and temptations and fears. The mother&rsquo;s heart bade
      her trust him; yet <i>could</i> she trust him to go and return?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have the cunning of a devil,&rsquo; she groaned, &lsquo;and as little heart! Let
      you go, when you only want the chance of deserting me again!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have to be quick,&rsquo; he replied, holding his watch in his hand, and
      smiling at the compliment in spite of his very real anxiety. &lsquo;There may be
      no choice in a minute or two.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you now; I&rsquo;ll follow you where you go to get the money!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, you won&rsquo;t. Either you trust me or you refuse. You&rsquo;ve a free choice,
      Clara. I tell you plainly I want little Jack, and I&rsquo;m not going to lose
      him if I can help it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you any other children?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;never had.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At least he had not been deceiving her in the matter of Jack. She knew
      that he had constantly come home at early hours only for the sake of
      playing with the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you. No one shall see that I&rsquo;m following you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s impossible. I shall have to go post haste in a cab. I&rsquo;ve
      half-a-dozen places to go to. Meet me on Westminster Bridge at one. I may
      be a few minutes later, but certainly not more than half-an-hour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the window and looked uneasily up and down the street. Clara
      pressed her hands upon her head and stared at him like one distracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is she?&rsquo; came from her involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, woman!&rsquo; he replied, walking to the door. She sprang to
      hold him. Instead of repulsing her, he folded his arm about her waist and
      kissed her lips two or three times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can get thousands of pounds,&rsquo; he whispered. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll be off before they
      have a trace. It&rsquo;s for Jack&rsquo;s sake, and I&rsquo;ll be kind to you as well, old
      woman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had suffered him to go; the kisses made her powerless, reminding her
      of a long-past dream. A moment after she rushed to the house door, but
      only to see him turning the corner of the street Then she flew to the
      bedroom. Jack was ill of a cold&mdash;she was nursing him in bed. But now
      she dressed him hurriedly, as if there were scarcely time to get to
      Westminster by the appointed hour. All was ready before eleven o&rsquo;clock,
      but it was now raining, and she durst not wait with the child in the open
      air for longer than was necessary. But all at once the fear possessed her
      lest the police might come to the house and she be detained. Ignorant of
      the law, and convinced from her husband&rsquo;s words that the stranger in rags
      had some sinister aim, she no sooner conceived the dread than she bundled
      into a hand-bag such few articles as it would hold and led the child
      hastily from the house. They walked to a tramway-line and had soon reached
      Westminster Bridge. But it was not half-past eleven, and the rain
      descended heavily. She sought a small eating-house not far from the Abbey,
      and by paying for some coffee and bread-and-butter, which neither she nor
      Jack could touch, obtained leave to sit in shelter till one o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five minutes to the hour she rose and hurried to the north end of the
      bridge, and stood there, aside from the traffic, shielding little Jack as
      much as she could with her umbrella, careless that her own clothing was
      getting wet through. Big Ben boomed its one stroke. Minute after minute
      passed, and her body seemed still to quiver from the sound. She was at
      once feverishly hot and so deadly chill that her teeth clattered together;
      her eyes throbbed with the intensity of their gaze into the distance. The
      quarter-past was chimed. Jack kept talking to her, but she could hear
      nothing. The rain drenched her; the wind was so high that she with
      difficulty held the umbrella above the child. Half-past, and no sign of
      her husband....
    </p>
    <p>
      She durst not go away from this spot Her eyes were blind with tears. A
      policeman spoke to her; she could only chatter meaningless sounds between
      her palsied lips. Jack coughed incessantly, begged to be taken home. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      so cold, mother, so cold!&rsquo; &lsquo;Only a few minutes more,&rsquo; she said. He began
      to cry, though a brave little soul....
    </p>
    <p>
      Four o&rsquo;clock struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Brixton our unconventional friend betook himself straight to
      Holloway. Having, as he felt sure, the means of making things decidedly
      uncomfortable for Mr. Rodman Williamson, it struck him that the eftest way
      would be to declare at once to his brother Richard all he knew and
      expected; Dick would not be slow in bestirring himself to make Rodman
      smart &lsquo;Arry was without false shame; he had no hesitation in facing his
      brother. But Mr. Mutimer, he was told, was not at home. Then he would see
      Mrs. Mutimer. But the servant was indisposed to admit him, or even to
      trouble her mistress. &lsquo;Arry had to request her to say that &lsquo;Mr. &lsquo;Enery
      Mutimer&rsquo; desired to see the lady of the house. He chuckled to see the
      astonishment produced by his words. Thus he got admittance to Adela.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was shocked at the sight of him, could find no words, yet gave him her
      hand. He told her he wished to see his brother on very particular
      business. But Richard would not be back before eight o&rsquo;clock in the
      evening, and it was impossible to say where he could be found. &lsquo;Arry would
      not tell Adela what brought him, only assured her that it had nothing to
      do with his own affairs. He would call again in the evening. Adela felt
      inhuman in allowing him to go out into the rain, but she could not risk
      giving displeasure to her husband by inviting &lsquo;Arry to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came again at half-past eight. Mutimer had been home nearly an hour and
      was expecting him. &lsquo;Arry lost no time in coming to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s married that other woman, I could see that much. Go and see for
      yourself. She give me &lsquo;alf-a-crown to tell all about him. I&rsquo;m only afraid
      he&rsquo;s got off by this time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you go and give information to the police at once?&rsquo; Mutimer
      cried, in exasperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arry might have replied that he had a delicacy in waiting upon those
      gentlemen. But his brother did not stay for an answer. Rushing from the
      room, he equipped himself instantly with hat, coat, and umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Show me the way to that house. Come along, there&rsquo;s no time to lose.
      Adela!&rsquo; he called, &lsquo;I have to go out; can&rsquo;t say when I shall be back.
      Don&rsquo;t sit up if I&rsquo;m late.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A hansom bore the brothers southwards as fast as hansom could go.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found Clara in the house, a haggard, frenzied woman. Already she had
      been to the police, but they were not inclined to hurry matters; she had
      no satisfactory evidence to give them. To Mutimer, when he had explained
      his position, she told everything&mdash;of her marriage in London nine
      years ago, her going with her husband to America, his desertion of her.
      Richard took her at once to the police-station. They would have to attend
      at the court next morning to swear an information.
    </p>
    <p>
      By ten o&rsquo;clock Mutimer was at Waterloo, taking train for Wimbledon. At
      Rodman&rsquo;s house he found darkness, but a little ringing brought Alice
      herself to the door. She thought it was her husband, and, on recognising
      Richard, all but dropped with fear; only some ill news could explain his
      coming thus. With difficulty he induced her to go into a room out of the
      hall. She was in her dressing-gown, her long beautiful hair in disorder,
      her pretty face white and distorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it, Dick? what is it, Dick?&rsquo; she kept repeating mechanically,
      with inarticulate moanings between. She had forgotten her enmity against
      her brother and spoke to him as in the old days. He, too, was all
      kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Try and keep quiet a little, Alice. I want to talk to you. Yes, it&rsquo;s
      about your husband, my poor girl; but there&rsquo;s nothing to be frightened at.
      He&rsquo;s gone away, that&rsquo;s all. I want you to come to London with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no more control over herself than a terrified child; her words and
      cries were so incoherent that Mutimer feared lest she had lost her senses.
      She was, in truth, on the borders of idiocy. It was more than half-an-hour
      before, with the servant&rsquo;s assistance, he could allay her hysterical
      anguish. Then she altogether refused to accompany him. If she did so she
      would miss her husband; he would not go without coming to see her. Richard
      was reminded by the servant that it was too late to go by train. He
      decided to remain in the house through the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not ventured to tell her all the truth, nor did her state encourage
      him to do so in the morning. But he then succeeded in persuading her to
      come with him; Rodman, he assured her, must already be out of England, for
      he had committed a criminal offence and knew that the police were after
      him. Alice was got to the station more dead than alive; they were at home
      in Holloway by half-past ten. Richard then left her in Adela&rsquo;s hands and
      sped once more to Brixton.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got home again at two. As he entered Adela came down the stairs to meet
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is she?&rsquo; he asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The same. The doctor was here an hour ago. We must keep her as quiet as
      possible. But she can&rsquo;t rest for a moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She added&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Three gentlemen have called to see you. They would leave no name, and, to
      tell the truth, were rather rude. They seemed to doubt my word when I said
      you were not in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At his request she attempted to describe these callers. Mutimer recognised
      them as members of his committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rude to you? You must have mistaken. What did they come here for? I shall
      in any case see them to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned to the subject of Alice&rsquo;s illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve half a mind to tell her the truth,&rsquo; Mutimer said. &lsquo;Surely she&rsquo;d put
      the blackguard out of her head after that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; you mustn&rsquo;t tell her!&rsquo; Adela interposed. &lsquo;I am sure it would be
      very unwise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice was growing worse; in an hour or two delirium began to declare
      itself. She had resisted all efforts to put her to bed; at most she would
      lie on a couch. Whilst Richard and his wife were debating what should be
      done, it was announced to them that the three gentlemen had called again.
      Mutimer went oft angrily to see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was engaged for half-an-hour. Then Adela heard the visitors depart; one
      of them was speaking loudly and with irritation. She waited for a moment
      at the head of the stairs, expecting that Mutimer would come out to her.
      As he did not, she went into the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer stood before the fireplace, his eyes on the ground, his face
      discoloured with vehement emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What has happened?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up and beckoned to her to approach.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Adela bad never seen him so smitten with grave trouble. She knew him in
      brutal anger and in surly ill-temper; but his present mood had nothing of
      either. He seemed to stagger beneath a blow which had all but crushed him
      and left him full of dread. He began to address her in a voice very unlike
      his own&mdash;thick, uncertain; he used short sentences, often incomplete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those men are on the committee. One of them got a letter this morning&mdash;anonymous.
      It said they were to be on their guard against me. Said the Company&rsquo;s a
      swindle&mdash;that I knew it&mdash;that I&rsquo;ve got money out of the people
      on false pretences. And Hilary&rsquo;s gone&mdash;gone off&mdash;taking all he
      could lay hands on. The letter says so&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. It says I&rsquo;m
      thick with the secretary&mdash;a man I never even saw. That he&rsquo;s a
      well-known swindler&mdash;Delancey his name is. And these fellows believe
      it&mdash;demand that I shall prove I&rsquo;m innocent. What proof can I give?
      They think I kept out of the way on purpose this morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He ceased speaking, and Adela stood mute, looking him in the face. She was
      appalled on his account. She did not love him; too often his presence
      caused her loathing. But of late she had been surprised into thinking more
      highly of some of his qualities than it had hitherto been possible for her
      to do. She could never forget that he toiled first and foremost for his
      own advancement to a very cheap reputation; he would not allow her to lose
      sight of it had she wished. But during the present winter she had
      discerned in him a genuine zeal to help the suffering, a fervour in kindly
      works of which she had not believed him capable. Very slowly the
      conviction had come to her, but in the end she could not resist it. One
      evening, in telling her of the hideous misery he had been amongst, his
      voice failed and she saw moisture in his eyes. Was his character changing?
      Had she wronged him in attaching too much importance to a fault which was
      merely on the surface? Oh, but there were too many indisputable charges
      against him. Yet a man&rsquo;s moral nature may sometimes be strengthened by
      experience of the evil he has wrought. All this rushed through her mind as
      she now stood gazing at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how can they credit an anonymous letter?&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;How can they
      believe the worst of you before making inquiries?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They have been to the office of the Company. Everything is upside down.
      They say Hilary isn&rsquo;t to be found.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who can have written such a letter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do I know? I have enemies enough, no doubt. Who hasn&rsquo;t that makes
      himself a leader?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the wrong note again. It discouraged her; she was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here, Adela,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;do you believe this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Believe it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m capable of doing a thing like that&mdash;scraping
      together by pennies the money of the poorest of the poor just to use it
      for my own purposes&mdash;could I do that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know I do not believe it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you don&rsquo;t speak as if you were certain. There&rsquo;s something&mdash;But
      how am I to prove I&rsquo;m innocent? How can I make people believe I wasn&rsquo;t in
      the plot? They&rsquo;ve only my word&mdash;who&rsquo;ll think that enough? Anyone can
      tell a lie and stick to it, if there&rsquo;s no positive proof against him. How
      am I to make <i>you</i> believe that I was taken in?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I tell you that a doubt of your innocence does not enter my mind. If
      it were necessary, I would stand up in public before all who accused you
      and declare that they were wrong. I do not need your assurance. I
      recognise that it would be impossible for you to commit such a crime.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it does me good to hear you say that,&rsquo; he replied, with light of
      hope in his eyes. &lsquo;I wanted to feel sure of that. You might have thought
      that&rsquo;&mdash;he sank his voice&mdash;&lsquo;that because I could think of
      destroying that will&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of that!&rsquo; she interrupted, with a gesture of pain. &lsquo;I say
      that I believe you. It is enough. Don&rsquo;t speak about me any more. Think of
      what has to be done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have promised to be in Clerkenwell at eight o&rsquo;clock. There&rsquo;ll be a
      meeting. I shall do my best to show that I am innocent. You&rsquo;ll look after
      Alice? It&rsquo;s awful to have to leave her whilst she&rsquo;s like that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Trust me. I will not leave her side for a moment. The doctor will be here
      again to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A thought struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Send out the girl for an evening paper. There may be something in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The paper was obtained. One of the first headings his eye fell upon was:
      &lsquo;Rumoured Collapse of a Public Company. Disappearance of the Secretary.&rsquo; 
      He showed it to Adela, and they read together. She saw that the finger
      with which he followed the lines quivered like a leaf. It was announced in
      a brief paragraph that the Secretary of the Irish Dairy Company was
      missing: that he seemed to have gone off with considerable sums. Moreover,
      that there were rumours in the City of a startling kind, relative to the
      character of the Company itself. The name of the secretary was Mr. Robert
      Delancey, but that was now believed to be a mere <i>alias</i>. The police
      were actively at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll be the ruin of me!&rsquo; Mutimer gasped. &lsquo;I can never prove that I knew
      nothing. You see, nothing&rsquo;s said about Hilary. It&rsquo;s that fellow Delancey
      who has run.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must find Mr. Hilary,&rsquo; said Adela urgently. &lsquo;Where does he live?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no idea. I only had the office address. Perhaps it isn&rsquo;t even his
      real name. It&rsquo;ll be my ruin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela was astonished to see him so broken down. He let himself sink upon a
      chair; his head and hands fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I can&rsquo;t understand why you should despair so!&rsquo; she exclaimed. &lsquo;You
      will speak to the meeting to-night. If the money is lost you will restore
      it. If you have been imprudent, that is no crime.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is&mdash;it is&mdash;when I had money of that kind entrusted to me!
      They won&rsquo;t hear me. They have condemned me already. What use is it to talk
      to them? They&rsquo;ll say everything comes to smash in my hands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke to him with such words of strengthening as one of his comrades
      might have used. She did not feel the tenderness of a wife, and had no
      power to assume it. But her voice was brave and true. She had made his
      interest, his reputation, her own. By degrees he recovered from the blow,
      and let her words give him heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m behaving like a fool; I couldn&rsquo;t go on
      different if I was really guilty. Who wrote that letter? I never saw the
      letter before, as far as I know. I wanted to keep it, but they wouldn&rsquo;t
      let me&mdash;trust them! What black guards they are I They&rsquo;re jealous of
      me. They know they can&rsquo;t speak like I do, that they haven&rsquo;t the same
      influence I have. So they&rsquo;re ready to believe the first lie that&rsquo;s brought
      against me. Let them look to themselves to-night! I&rsquo;ll give them a piece
      of my mind&mdash;see if I don&rsquo;t! What&rsquo;s to-day? Friday. On Sunday I&rsquo;ll
      have the biggest meeting ever gathered in the East End. If they shout out
      against me, I&rsquo;ll tell them to their faces that they&rsquo;re mean-spirited curs.
      They haven&rsquo;t the courage to rise and get by force what they&rsquo;ll never have
      by asking for it, and when a man does his best to help them they throw mud
      at him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But they won&rsquo;t do so,&rsquo; Adela urged. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be unjust. Wait and see. They
      will shout <i>for</i>, not <i>against</i> you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you keep &lsquo;Arry here?&rsquo; he asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He refused to stay. I gave him money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You should have forced him to stay How can I have a brother of my own
      living a life like that? You did wrong to give him money. He&rsquo;ll only use
      it to make a beast of himself. I must find him again; I can&rsquo;t let him go
      to ruin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arry had come back to Holloway the previous night to inform Adela that
      her husband might not return till morning. As she said, it had been
      impossible to detain him. He was too far gone in unconventionality to
      spend a night under a decent roof. Home-sickness for the gutter possessed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Alice had become quieter. It was half-past six; Mutimer
      had to be at the meeting-place in Clerkenwell by eight. Adela sat by Alice
      whilst the servant hurriedly prepared a meal; then the girl took her
      place, and she went down to her husband. They were in the middle of their
      meal when they heard the front-door slam. Mutimer started up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that? Who&rsquo;s gone out?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela ran to the foot of the stairs and called the servant&rsquo;s name softly.
      It was a minute before the girl appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who has just gone out, Mary?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gone out? No one, mum!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Mrs. Rodman lying still?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl went to see. She had left Alice for a few moments previously. She
      appeared again at the head of the stairs with a face of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Rodman isn&rsquo;t there, mum!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer flew up the staircase. Alice was nowhere to be found. It could not
      be doubted that she had fled in a delirious state. Richard rushed into the
      street, but it was very dark, and rain was falling. There was no trace of
      the fugitive. He came back to the door, where Adela stood; he put out his
      hand and held her arm as if she needed support.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me my hat! She&rsquo;ll die in the street, in the rain! I&rsquo;ll go one way;
      the girl must go the other. My hat!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will go one way myself,&rsquo; said Adela hurriedly. &lsquo;You must take an
      umbrella: it pours. Mary! my waterproof!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They ran in opposite directions. It was a quiet by-street, with no shops
      to cast light upon the pavement. Adela encountered a constable before she
      had gone very far, and begged for his assistance. He promised to be on the
      look-out, but advised her to go on a short distance to the police-station
      and leave a description of the missing woman. She did so; then, finding
      the search hopeless in this quarter, turned homewards. Mutimer was still
      absent, but he appeared in five minutes; as unsuccessful as herself. She
      told him of her visit to the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must keep going about,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;She can&rsquo;t be far off; her strength,
      surely, wouldn&rsquo;t take her far.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela felt for him profoundly; for once he had not a thought of himself,
      his distress was absorbing. He was on the point of leaving the house
      again, when she remembered the meeting at which he was expected. She spoke
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do I care?&rsquo; he replied, waving his arm. &lsquo;Let them think what they
      like. I must find Alice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela saw in a moment all that his absence would involve. He could of
      course explain subsequently, but in the meantime vast harm would have been
      done. It was impossible to neglect the meeting altogether. She ran after
      him and stopped him on the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will go to this meeting for you,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;A cab will take me there
      and bring me back. I will let them know what keeps you away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You! How can you go? Among those men?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely I have nothing to fear from them? Have you lost all your faith
      suddenly? You cannot go, but someone must. I will speak to them so that
      they cannot but believe me. You continue the search; I will go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood together in the pouring rain. Mutimer caught her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never knew what a wife could be till now,&rsquo; he exclaimed hoarsely. &lsquo;And
      I never knew <i>you</i>!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Find me a cab and give the man the address. I will be ready in an
      instant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her cheeks were on fire; her nerves quivered with excitement. She had made
      the proposal almost involuntarily; only his thanks gave her some
      understanding of what she was about to do. But she did not shrink; a man&rsquo;s&mdash;better
      still, a woman&rsquo;s&mdash;noblest courage throbbed in her. If need were, she
      too could stand forward in a worthy cause and speak the truth undauntedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cab was bearing her away. She looked at her watch in the moment of
      passing a street lamp and just saw that it was eight o&rsquo;clock. The meeting
      would be full by this; they would already be drawing ill conclusions from
      Mutimer&rsquo;s absence Faster, faster! Every moment lost increased the force of
      prejudice against him. She could scarcely have felt more zeal on behalf of
      the man whom her soul loved. In the fever of her brain she was conscious
      of a wish that even now that love could be her husband&rsquo;s. Ah no, no! But
      serve him she could and loyally. The lights flew by in the streets of
      Islington; the driver was making the utmost speed he durst. A check among
      thronging vehicles anguished her. But it was past, and here at length came
      the pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      A crowd of perhaps a hundred men was gathered about the ill-lighted
      entrance to what had formerly been a low-class dancing-saloon. Adela saw
      them come thronging about the cab, heard their cries of discontent and of
      surprise when she showed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait for me!&rsquo; she called to the driver, and straightway walked to the
      door. The men made way for her. On the threshold she turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish to see some member of the committee. I am Mrs. Mutimer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a coarse laugh from some fellows, but others cried, &lsquo;Shut up!
      she&rsquo;s a lady.&rsquo; One stepped forward and announced himself as a
      committee-man. He followed her into the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My husband cannot come,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Will you please show me where I can
      speak to the meeting and tell them the reason of his absence?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Much amazed, the committee-man led her into the hall. It was whitewashed,
      furnished with plain benches, lit with a few gas-jets. There was scarcely
      room to move for the crowd. Every man seemed to be talking at the pitch of
      his voice. The effect was an angry roar. Adela&rsquo;s guide with difficulty
      made a passage for her to the platform, for it took some time before the
      crowd realised what was going on. At length she stood in a place whence
      she could survey the assembly. On the wall behind her hung a great sheet
      of paper on which were inscribed the names of all who had deposited money
      with Mutimer. Adela glanced at it and understood. Instead of being
      agitated she possessed an extraordinary lucidity of mind, a calmness of
      nerve which she afterwards remembered as something miraculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The committee-man roared for silence, then in a few words explained Mrs.
      Mutimer&rsquo;s wish to make &lsquo;a speech.&rsquo; To Adela&rsquo;s ears there seemed something
      of malice in this expression; she did not like, either, the laugh which it
      elicited. But quiet was speedily restored by a few men of sturdy lungs.
      She stepped to the front of the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene was a singular one. Adela had thrown off her waterproof in the
      cab; she stood in her lady-like costume of home, her hat only showing that
      she had come from a distance. For years her cheeks had been very pale; in
      this moment her whole face was white as marble. Her delicate beauty made
      strange contrast with the faces on each side and in front of her&mdash;faces
      of rude intelligence, faces of fathomless stupidity, faces degraded into
      something less than human. But all were listening, all straining towards
      her. There were a few whispers of honest admiration, a few of vile jest.
      She began to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have come here because my husband cannot come. It is most unfortunate
      that he cannot, for he tells me that someone has been throwing doubt upon
      his honesty. He would be here, but that a terrible misfortune has befallen
      him. His sister was lying ill in our house. A little more than an hour ago
      she was by chance left alone and, being delirious&mdash;out of her mind&mdash;escaped
      from the house. My husband is now searching for her everywhere; she may be
      dying somewhere in the streets. That is the explanation I have come to
      give you. But I will say a word more. I do not know who has spoken ill of
      my husband; I do not know his reasons for doing so. This, however, I know,
      that Richard Mutimer has done you no wrong, and that he is incapable of
      the horrible thing of which he is accused. You must believe it; you wrong
      yourselves if you refuse to. To-morrow, no doubt, he will come and speak
      for himself. Till then I beg you to take the worthy part and credit good
      rather than evil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She ceased, and, turning to the committee-man, who still stood near her,
      requested him to guide her from the room. As she moved down from the
      platform the crowd recovered itself from the spell of her voice. The
      majority cheered, but there were not a few dissentient howls. Adela had
      ears for nothing; a path opened before her, and she walked along it with
      bowed head. Her heart was now beating violently; she felt that she must
      walk quickly or perchance her strength would fail her before she reached
      the door. As she disappeared there again arose the mingled uproar of
      cheers and groans; it came to her like the bellow of a pursuing monster as
      she fled along the passage. And in truth Demos was on her track. A few
      kept up with her; the rest jammed themselves in the door way, hustled each
      other, fought. The dozen who came out to the pavement altogether helped
      her into the cab, then gave a hearty cheer as she drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Demos, not malevolent at the last, but to Adela none the less
      something to be fled from, something which excited thoughts of horrible
      possibilities, in its very good-humour and its praise of her a sound of
      fear.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      His search being vain, Mutimer hastened from one police-station to
      another, leaving descriptions of his sister at each. When he came home
      again Adela had just arrived. She was suffering too much from the reaction
      which followed upon her excitement to give him more than the briefest
      account of what she had heard and said; but Mutimer cared little for
      details. He drew an easy-chair near to the fire and begged her to rest. As
      she lay back for a moment with closed eyes, he took her faint hand and put
      it to his lips. He had never done so before; when she glanced at him he
      averted his face in embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have persuaded her to go to bed, but she declared that sleep was
      impossible; she had much rather sit up with him till news came of Alice,
      as it surely must do in course of the night. For Mutimer there was no
      resting; he circled continually about the neighbouring streets, returning
      to the house every quarter of an hour, always to find Adela in the same
      position. Her heart would not fall to its normal beat, and the vision of
      those harsh faces would not pass from her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      At two o&rsquo;clock they heard that Alice was found. She had been discovered
      several miles from home, lying unconscious in the street, and was now in a
      hospital. Mutimer set off at once; he returned with the report that she
      was between life and death. It was impossible to remove her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela slept a little between six and eight; her husband took even shorter
      rest. When she came down to the sitting-room, he was reading the morning
      paper. As she entered he uttered a cry of astonishment and rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here!&rsquo; he exclaimed to her. &lsquo;Read that!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to an account of the Irish Dairy Company frauds, in which it
      was stated that the secretary, known as Delancey, appeared also to have
      borne the name of Rodman.
    </p>
    <p>
      They gazed at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then it was Rodman wrote that letter!&rsquo; Mutimer cried. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll swear to it.
      He did it to injure me at the last moment. Why haven&rsquo;t they got him yet?
      The police are useless. But they&rsquo;ve got Hilary, I see&mdash;yes, they&rsquo;ve
      got Hilary. He was caught at Dover. Ha, ha! He denies everything&mdash;says
      he didn&rsquo;t even know of the secretary&rsquo;s decamping. The lying scoundrel!
      Says he was going to Paris on private business. But they&rsquo;ve got him! And
      see here again: &ldquo;The same Rodman is at present wanted by the police on a
      charge of bigamy.&rdquo; Wanted! If they weren&rsquo;t incompetent fools they&rsquo;d have
      had him already. Ten to one he&rsquo;s out of England.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a day of tumult for Mutimer. At the hospital he found no
      encouragement, but he could only leave Alice in the hands of the doctors.
      From the hospital he went to his mother&rsquo;s house; he had not yet had time
      to let her know of anything. But his main business lay in Clerkenwell and
      in various parts of the East End, wherever he could see his
      fellow-agitators. In hot haste he wrote an announcement of a meeting on
      Clerkenwell Green for Sunday afternoon, and had thousands of copies
      printed on slips; by evening these were scattered throughout his
      &lsquo;parishes.&rsquo; He found that the calumny affecting him was already widely
      known; several members of his committee met him with black looks. Here and
      there an ironical question was put to him about his sister&rsquo;s health. With
      the knowledge that Alice might be dying or dead, he could scarcely find
      words of reply. His mood changed from fear and indignation to a grim fury;
      within a few hours he made many resolute enemies by his reckless vehemence
      and vituperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening papers brought him a piece of intelligence which would have
      rejoiced him but for something with which it was coupled. Delancey, <i>alias</i>
      Rodman, <i>alias</i> Williamson, was arrested; he had been caught in
      Hamburg. The telegram added that he talked freely and had implicated a
      number of persons&mdash;among them a certain Socialist agitator, name not
      given. As Mutimer read this he fell for a moment into blank despair. He
      returned at once to Holloway, all but resolved to throw up the game&mdash;to
      abandon the effort to defend himself, and wait for what might result from
      the judicial investigations. Adela resisted this to the uttermost. She
      understood that such appearance of fear would be fatal to him. With a
      knowledge of Demos which owed much to her last night&rsquo;s experience, she
      urged to him that behind his back calumny would thrive unchecked, would
      grow in a day to proportions altogether irresistible. She succeeded in
      restoring his courage, though at the same time there revived in Mutimer
      the savage spirit which could only result in harm to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is how they repay a man who works for them!&rsquo; he cried repeatedly.
      &lsquo;The ungrateful brutes! Let me once clear myself, and I&rsquo;ll throw it up,
      bid them find someone else to fight their battles for them. It&rsquo;s always
      been the same: history shows it What have I got for myself out of it all,
      I&rsquo;d like to know? Haven&rsquo;t I given them every penny I had? Let them do
      their worst! Let them bark and bray till they are hoarse!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have kept away from Clerkenwell that evening, but even this Adela
      would not let him do. She insisted that he must be seen and heard, that
      the force of innocence would prevail even with his enemies. The couple of
      hours he passed with her were spent in ceaseless encouragement on her
      side, in violent tirades on his. He paced the room like a caged lion, at
      one moment execrating Rodman, the next railing against the mob to whose
      interests he had devoted himself. Now and then his voice softened, and he
      spoke of Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The scoundrel set even her against me! If she lives, perhaps she&rsquo;ll
      believe I&rsquo;m guilty; how can my word stand against her husband&rsquo;s? Why, he
      isn&rsquo;t her husband at all! It&rsquo;s a good thing if she dies&mdash;the best
      thing that could happen. What will become of her? What are we to call her?
      She&rsquo;s neither married nor single. Can we keep it from her, do you think?
      No, that won&rsquo;t do; she must be free to marry an honest man. You&rsquo;ll try and
      make friends with her, Adela&mdash;if ever you&rsquo;ve the chance? She&rsquo;ll have
      to live with us, of course unless she&rsquo;d rather live with mother. We
      mustn&rsquo;t tell her for a long time, till she&rsquo;s strong enough to bear it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He with difficulty ate a few mouthfuls and went off to Clerkenwell. In the
      erstwhile dancing-saloon it was a night of tempest. Mutimer had never
      before addressed an unfriendly audience. After the first few interruptions
      he lost his temper, and with it his cause, as far as these present hearers
      were concerned. When he left them, it was amid the mutterings of a storm
      which was not quite&mdash;only not quite&mdash;ready to burst in fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who knows you won&rsquo;t take yer &lsquo;ook before to-morrow?&rsquo; cried a voice as he
      neared the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait and see!&rsquo; Mutimer shouted in reply, with a savage laugh. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a
      word or two to say yet to blackguards like you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He could count on some twenty pairs of fists in the room, if it came to
      that point; but he was allowed to depart unmolested.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way home he called at the hospital. There was no change in Alice&rsquo;s
      condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day he remained at home till it was time to start for Clerkenwell
      Green. He was all but worn out, and there was nothing of any use to be
      done before the meeting assembled. Adela went for him to the hospital and
      brought back still the same report. He ate fairly well of his midday
      dinner, seeming somewhat calmer. Adela, foreseeing his main danger, begged
      him to address the people without anger, assured him that a dignified
      self-possession would go much farther than any amount of blustering. He
      was induced to promise that he would follow her advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He purposed walking to the Green; the exercise would perhaps keep his
      nerves in order. When it was time to start, he took Adela&rsquo;s hand, and for
      a second time kissed it. She made an effort over herself and held her lips
      to him. The &lsquo;good-bye&rsquo; was exchanged, with a word of strengthening from
      Adela; but still he did not go. He was endeavouring to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve thanked you half enough,&rsquo; he said at length, &lsquo;for what
      you did on Friday night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, more than enough,&rsquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You make little of it, but it&rsquo;s a thing very few women would have done.
      And it was hard for you, because you&rsquo;re a lady.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No less a woman,&rsquo; murmured Adela, her head bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a good woman&mdash;I believe with all my heart. I want to ask you to
      forgive me&mdash;for things I once said to you. I was a brute. Perhaps if
      I had been brought up in the same kind of way that you were&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      the difference between us, you see. But try if you can to forget it. I&rsquo;ll
      never think anything but good of you as long as I live.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not reply, for a great sob was choking her. She pressed his
      band; the tears broke from her eyes as she turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It being Sunday afternoon, visitors were admitted to the hospital in which
      Alice lay. Mutimer had allowed himself time to pass five minutes by his
      sister&rsquo;s bedside on the way to Clerkenwell. Alice was still unconscious;
      she lay motionless, but her lips muttered unintelligible words. He bent
      over her and spoke, but she did not regard him. It was perhaps the keenest
      pain Mutimer had ever known to look into those eyes and meet no answering
      intelligence. By close listening he believed he heard her utter the name
      of her husband. It was useless to stay; he kissed her and left the ward.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his arrival at Clerkenwell Green&mdash;a large triangular space which
      merits the name of Green as much as the Strand&mdash;he found a
      considerable gathering already assembled about the cart from which he was
      to speak. The inner circle consisted of his friends&mdash;some fifty who
      remained staunch in their faith. Prominent among them was the man
      Redgrave, he who had presented the address when Mutimer took leave of his
      New Wanley workpeople. He had come to London at the same time as his
      leader, and had done much to recommend Mutimer&rsquo;s scheme in the East End.
      His muscular height made those about him look puny. He was red in the face
      with the excitement of abusing Mutimer&rsquo;s enemies, and looked as if nothing
      would please him better than to second words with arguments more cogent.
      He and those about him hailed the agitator&rsquo;s appearance with three ringing
      cheers. A little later came a supporter whom Richard had not expected to
      see&mdash;Mr. Westlake. Only this morning intelligence of what was going
      on had reached his ears. At once he had scouted the accusations as
      incredible; he deemed it a duty to present himself on Mutimer&rsquo;s side.
      Outside this small cluster was an indefinable mob, a portion of it
      bitterly hostile, a part indifferent; among the latter a large element of
      mere drifting blackguardism, the raff of a city, anticipating with
      pleasure an uproar which would give them unwonted opportunities of
      violence and pillage. These gentle men would with equal zeal declare for
      Mutimer or his opponents, as the fortune of the day directed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The core of the hostile party consisted of those who followed the banner
      of Comrade Roodhouse, the ralliers to the &lsquo;Tocsin.&rsquo; For them it was a
      great occasion. The previous evening had seen a clamorous assembly in the
      room behind the Hoxton coffee-shop. Comrade Roodhouse professed to have
      full details of the scandal which had just come to light. According to
      him, there was no doubt whatever that Mutimer had known from the first the
      character of the bogus Company, and had wittingly used the money of the
      East-Enders to aid in floating a concern which would benefit himself and a
      few others. Roodhouse disclosed the identity of Mr. Robert Delancey, and
      explained the relations existing between Rodman and Mutimer, ignoring the
      fact that a lawsuit had of late turned their friendship to mutual
      animosity. It was an opportunity not to be missed for paying back the hard
      things Mutimer had constantly said of the &lsquo;Tocsin&rsquo; party. Comrade
      Roodhouse was busy in the crowd, sowing calumnies and fermenting wrath. In
      the crowd were our old acquaintances Messrs. Cowes and Cullen, each
      haranguing as many as could be got to form a circle and listen, indulging
      themselves in measureless vituperation, crying shame on traitors to the
      noble cause. Here, too, was Daniel Dabbs, mainly interested in the
      occasion as an admirable provocative of thirst. He was much disposed to
      believe Mutimer guilty, but understood that it was none of his business to
      openly take part with either side. He stood well on the limits of the
      throng; it was not impossible that the debate might end in the cracking of
      crowns, in which case Mr. Dabbs, as a respectable licensed victualler
      whose weekly profits had long since made him smile at the follies of his
      youth, would certainly incur no needless risk to his own valuable scalp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The throng thickened; it was impossible that the speakers should be
      audible to the whole assembly. Hastily it was decided to arrange two
      centres. Whilst Mutimer was speaking at the lower end of the Green,
      Redgrave would lift up his voice in the opposite part, and make it
      understood that Mutimer would repeat his address there as soon as he had
      satisfied the hearers below. The meeting was announced for three o&rsquo;clock,
      but it was half an hour later before Mutimer stood up on the cart and
      extended his hand in appeal for silence. It at first seemed as if he could
      not succeed in making his voice heard at all. A cluster of Roodhouse&rsquo;s
      followers, under the pretence of demanding quiet, made incessant tumult.
      But ultimately the majority, those who were merely curious, and such of
      the angry East-Enders as really wanted to hear what Mutimer had to say for
      himself, imposed silence. Richard began his speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had kept Adela&rsquo;s warning in mind, and determined to be calmly dignified
      in his refutal of the charges brought against him. For five minutes he
      impressed his hearers. He had never spoken better. In the beginning he
      briefly referred to the facts of his life, spoke of the use he had made of
      wealth when he possessed it, demanded if it was likely that he should join
      with swindlers to rob the very class to which he himself was proud to
      belong, and for which he had toiled unceasingly. He spoke of Rodman, and
      denied that he had ever known of this man&rsquo;s connection with the Company&mdash;a
      man who was his worst enemy. He it was, this Rodman, who doubtless had
      written the letter which first directed suspicion in the wrong quarter; it
      was an act such as Rodman would be capable of, for the sake of gratifying
      his enmity. And how had that enmity arisen? He told the story of the
      lawsuit; showed how, in that matter, he had stood up for common honesty,
      though at the time Rodman was his friend. Then he passed to the subject of
      his stewardship. Why had he put that trust money into a concern without
      sufficient investigation? He could make but one straightforward answer: he
      had believed that the Company was sound, and he bought shares because the
      dividends promised to be large, and it was his first desire to do the very
      best he could for those who had laid their hard-earned savings in his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes he had had increasing difficulty in holding his voice
      above the noise of interruptions, hostile or friendly. It now became
      impossible for him to proceed. A man who was lifted on to the shoulders of
      two others began to make a counter-speech, roaring so that those around
      could not but attend to him. He declared himself one of those whom Mutimer
      had robbed; all his savings for seven months were gone; he was now out of
      work, and his family would soon be starving. Richard&rsquo;s blood boiled as he
      heard these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You lie!&rsquo; he bellowed in return; &lsquo;I know you. You are the fellow who said
      last night that I should run away, and never come at all to this meeting.
      I called you a blackguard then, and I call you a liar now. You have put in
      my hand six threepences, and no more. The money you might have saved you
      constantly got drunk upon. Your money is waiting for you: you have only to
      come and apply for it. And I say the same to all the rest. I am ready to
      pay all the money back, and pay it too with interest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course you are!&rsquo; vociferated the other. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t steal it, so you
      offer to give it back. We know that game.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the commencement of utter confusion. A hundred voices were trying
      to make themselves heard. The great crowd swayed this way and that.
      Mutimer looked on a tempest of savage faces&mdash;a sight which might have
      daunted any man in his position. Fists were shaken at him, curses were
      roared at him from every direction. It was clear that the feeling of the
      mob was hopelessly against him; his explanations were ridiculed. A second
      man was reared on others&rsquo; shoulders; but instead of speaking from the
      place where he was, he demanded to be borne forward and helped to a
      standing on the cart. This was effected after a brief struggle with
      Mutimer&rsquo;s supporters. Then all at once there was a cessation of the hubbub
      that the new speaker might be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look at this man!&rsquo; he cried, pointing at Mutimer, who had drawn as far
      aside as the cart would let him. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s been a-tellin&rsquo; you what he did when
      somebody died an&rsquo; left him a fortune. There&rsquo;s just one thing he&rsquo;s forgot,
      an&rsquo; shall I tell you what that is? When he was a workin&rsquo; man like
      ourselves, mates, he was a-goin&rsquo; to marry a pore girl, a workin&rsquo; girl.
      When he gets his money, what does he do? Why, he pitches her over, if you
      please, an&rsquo; marries a fine lady, as took him because he was rich&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      the way <i>ladies</i> always chooses their husbands, y&rsquo;understand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by a terrific yell, but by dint of vigorous pantomime
      secured a hearing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But wait a bit, maties; I haven&rsquo;t done yet. He pitches over the pore
      girl, but he does worse afterwards. He sets a tale a-goin&rsquo; as she&rsquo;d
      disgraced herself, as she wasn&rsquo;t fit to be a honest man&rsquo;s wife. An&rsquo; it was
      all a damned lie, as lots of us knows. Now what d&rsquo;ye think o&rsquo; that! This
      is a friend o&rsquo; the People, this is! This is the man as &lsquo;as your interests
      at &lsquo;art, mates! If he&rsquo;ll do a thing like that, won&rsquo;t he rob you of your
      savin&rsquo;s?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he knew what the man was about to speak of, Mutimer felt the
      blood rush back upon his heart. It was as when a criminal hears delivered
      against him a damning item of evidence. He knew that he was pale, that
      every feature declared his consciousness of guilt. In vain he tried to
      face the mob and smile contemptuously. His eyes fell; he stood without the
      power of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yell was repeated, and prolonged, owing to another cause than the
      accusation just heard. When the accuser was borne forwards to the cart, a
      rumour spread among those more remote that an attack was being made on
      Mutimer and his friends. The rumour reached that part of the Green where
      Redgrave was then haranguing. At once the listeners faced about in the
      direction of the supposed conflict. Redgrave himself leaped down, and
      called upon all supporters of Mutimer to follow him. It was the crash
      between two crowds which led to the prolonging of the yell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting was over, the riot had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Picture them, the indignant champions of honesty, the avengers of virtue
      defamed! Demos was roused, was tired of listening to mere articulate
      speech; it was time for a good wild-beast roar, for a taste of bloodshed.
      Scarcely a face in all the mob but distorted itself to express as much
      savagery as can be got out of the human countenance. Mutimer, seeing what
      had come, sprang down from the cart. He was at once carried yards away in
      an irresistible rush. Impossible for him and his friends to endeavour to
      hold their ground: they were too vastly outnumbered; the most they could
      do was to hold together and use every opportunity of retreat, standing in
      the meanwhile on the defensive. There was no adequate body of police on
      the Green; the riot would take its course unimpeded by the hired servants
      of the capitalist State. Redgrave little by little fought his way to
      within sight of Mutimer; he brought with him a small but determined
      contingent. On all sides was the thud of blows, the indignant shouting of
      the few who desired to preserve order mingled with the clamour of those
      who combated. Demos was having his way; civilisation was blotted out, and
      club law proclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutimer lost his hat in jumping from the cart; in five minutes his
      waistcoat and shirt were rent open, whether by friends in guarding him, or
      by foes in assailing, it was impossible to say. But his bodyguard held
      together with wonderful firmness, only now and then an enemy got near
      enough to dash a fist in his face. If he fell into the hands of the mob he
      was done for; Mutimer knew that, and was ready to fight for his life. But
      the direction taken by the main current of the crowd favoured him. In
      about twenty minutes he was swept away from the Green, and into a street.
      There were now fewer foes about him; he saw an opportunity, and together
      with Redgrave burst away. There was no shame in taking to flight where the
      odds against him were so overwhelming. But pursuers were close behind him;
      their cry gave a lead to the chase. He looked for some by-way as he rushed
      along the pavement. But an unexpected refuge offered itself. He was
      passing a little group of women, when a voice from among them cried loudly&mdash;&lsquo;In
      here! In here!&rsquo; He saw that a house-door was open, saw a hand beckon
      wildly, and at once sprang for the retreat. A woman entered immediately
      behind him and slammed the door, but he did not see that a stick which the
      foremost of his pursuers had flung at him came with a terrible blow full
      upon his preserver&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he could only lean against the wall of the passage,
      recovering his breath. Where he stood it was almost dark, for the evening
      was drawing in. The woman who had rescued him was standing near, but he
      could not distinguish her face. He heard the mob assembling in the narrow
      street, their shouts, their trampling, and speedily there began a great
      noise at the door. A beating with sticks and fists, a thundering at the
      knocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you the landlady?&rsquo; Mutimer asked, turning to his silent companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; was the reply. &lsquo;She is outside, I must put up the chain. They might
      get her latchkey from her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first syllable he started; the voice was so familiar to him. The
      words were spoken with an entire absence of womanish consternation; the
      voice trembled a little, but for all that there was calm courage in its
      sound. When she had made the door secure and turned again towards him, he
      looked into her face as closely as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it Emma?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Both were silent. Mutimer forgot all about his danger; that at this moment
      he should meet Emma Vine, that it should be she who saved him, impressed
      him with awe which was stronger than all the multitude of sensations just
      now battling within him. For it was her name that had roused the rabble
      finally against him. For his wrong to her he knew that he would have
      suffered justly; yet her hand it was that barred the door against his
      brutal pursuers. A sudden weakness shook his limbs; he had again to lean
      upon the wall for support, and, scarcely conscious of what he did, he
      sobbed three or four times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you hurt?&rsquo; Emma asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;m not hurt, no.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Two children had come down the stairs, and were clinging to Emma, crying
      with fright. For the noise at the door was growing terrific.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is there in the house?&rsquo; Mutimer asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one, I think. The landlady and two other women who live here are
      outside. My sister is away somewhere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can I get off by the back?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. There&rsquo;s a little yard, but the walls are far too high.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll break the door through. If they do, the devils are as likely to
      kill you as me. I must go upstairs to a window and speak to them. I may do
      something yet. Sooner than put you in danger I&rsquo;ll go out and let them do
      their worst Listen to them! That&rsquo;s the People, that is! I deserve killing,
      fool that I am, if only for the lying good I&rsquo;ve said of them. Let me go up
      into your room, if it has a window in the front.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He led up the stairs, and Emma showed him the door of her room&mdash;the
      same in which she had received the visit of Daniel Dabbs. He looked about
      it, saw the poverty of it. Then he looked at Emma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good God! Who has hit you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great cut on her cheek, the blood was running down upon her
      dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Somebody threw a stick,&rsquo; she answered, trying to smile. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t feel it;
      I&rsquo;ll tie a handkerchief on it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again a fit of sobbing seized him; he felt as weak as a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The cowardly roughs! Give me the handkerchief&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tie it. Emma!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think of your own safety,&rsquo; she replied hurriedly. &lsquo;I tell you I don&rsquo;t
      feel any pain. Do you think you can get them to listen to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll try. There&rsquo;s nothing else for it. You stand at the back of the room;
      they may throw something at me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, then, don&rsquo;t open the window! They can&rsquo;t break the door. Some help
      will come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They <i>will</i> break the door. You&rsquo;d be as safe among wild beasts as
      among those fellows if they get into the house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw up the sash, though Emma would not go from his side. In the
      street below was a multitude which made but one ravening monster; all its
      eyes were directed to the upper storeys of this house. Mutimer looked to
      the right and to the left. In the latter quarter he saw the signs of a
      struggle Straining his eyes through the dusk, he perceived a mounted
      police-officer forcing his way through the throng; on either side were
      visible the helmets of constables. He drew a deep sigh of relief, for the
      efforts of the mob against the house door could scarcely succeed unless
      they used more formidable weapons for assault, and that would now be all
      but impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew his bead back into the room and looked at Emma with a laugh of
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The police are making way! There&rsquo;s nothing to fear now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come away from the window, then,&rsquo; Emma urged. &lsquo;It is useless to show
      yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let them see me, the blackguards! They&rsquo;re so tight packed they haven&rsquo;t a
      band among them to aim anything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he again leaned forward from the window-sill, and stretched
      his arms towards the approaching rescuers. That same instant a heavy
      fragment of stone, hurled with deadly force and precision, struck him upon
      the temple. The violence of the blow flung him back into the room; he
      dropped to his knees, threw out a hand as if to save himself, then sank
      face foremost upon the floor. Not a sound had escaped his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma, with a low cry of horror, bent to him and put her arm about his
      body. Raising his head, she saw that, though his eyes were staring, they
      had no power of sight; on his lips were flecks of blood. She laid her
      cheeks to his lips, but could discern no breath; she tore apart the
      clothing from his breast, but her hand could not find his heart. Then she
      rushed for a pillow, placed it beneath his head, and began to bathe his
      face. Not all the great love which leaped like flame in her bosom could
      call the dead to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yells which had greeted Mutimer&rsquo;s appearance at the window were
      followed by a steady roar, mingled with scornful laughter at his speedy
      retreat; only a few saw or suspected that he had been gravely hit by the
      missile. Then the tumult began to change its character; attention was
      drawn from the house to the advancing police, behind whom came a band of
      Mutimer&rsquo;s adherents, led by Redgrave. The latter were cheering; the
      hostile rabble met their cheers with defiant challenges. The police had
      now almost more than they could do to prevent a furious collision between
      the two bodies; but their numbers kept increasing, as detachments arrived
      one after another, and at length the house itself was firmly guarded,
      whilst the rioters on both sides were being put to flight. It was not a
      long street; the police cleared it completely and allowed no one to enter
      at either end.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all but dark when at length the door of Emma&rsquo;s room was opened and
      six or seven women appeared, searching for Mutimer. The landlady was
      foremost; she carried a lamp. It showed the dead man at full length on the
      floor, and Emma kneeling beside him, holding his hand. Near her were the
      two children, crying miserably. Emma appeared to have lost her voice; when
      the light flashed upon her eyes she covered them with one hand, with the
      other pointed downwards. The women broke into cries of fright and
      lamentation. They clustered around the prostrate form, examined it,
      demanded explanations. One at length sped down to the street and shortly
      returned with two policemen. A messenger was despatched for a doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma did not move; she was not weeping, but paid no attention to any words
      addressed to her. The room was thronged with curious neighbours, there was
      a hubbub of talk. When at length the medical man arrived, he cleared the
      chamber of all except Emma. After a brief examination of the body he said
      to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are his wife?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She, still kneeling, looked up into his face with pained astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His wife? Oh no! I am a stranger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor showed surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was killed in your presence?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is dead&mdash;really dead?&rsquo; she asked under her breath. And, as she
      spoke, she laid her hand upon his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He must have been killed instantaneously. Did the stone fall in the room?
      Was it a stone?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No one had searched for the missile. The doctor discovered it not far
      away. Whilst he was weighing it in his hand there came a knock at the
      door. It was Mr. Westlake who entered. He came and looked at the dead man,
      then, introducing himself, spoke a few words with the doctor. Assured that
      there was no shadow of hope, he withdrew, having looked closely at Emma,
      who now stood a little apart, her hands held together before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor departed a few moments later. He had examined the wound on the
      girl&rsquo;s face, and found that it was not serious. As he was going, Emma said
      to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you tell them to keep away&mdash;all the people in the house?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is your own room?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I live here with my sister.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will ask them to respect your wish. The body must stay here for the
      present, though.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, yes, I know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is your sister at home?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She will be soon. Please tell them not to come here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was alone again with the dead. It cost her great efforts of mind to
      convince herself that Mutimer really had breathed his last; it seemed to
      her but a moment since she heard him speak, heard him laugh; was not a
      trace of the laugh even now discernible on his countenance? How was it
      possible for life to vanish in this way? She constantly touched him, spoke
      to him. It was incredible that he should not be able to hear her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her love for him was immeasurable. Bitterness she had long since overcome,
      and she had thought that love, too, was gone with it. She had deceived
      herself. Her heart, incredible as it may seem, had even known a kind of
      hope&mdash;how else could she have borne the life which fate laid upon
      her?&mdash;the hope that is one with love, that asks nothing of the
      reason, nor yields to reason&rsquo;s contumely. He had been smitten dead at the
      moment that she loved him dearest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sister Kate came in. She had been spending the day with friends in
      another part of London. When just within the door she stopped and looked
      at the body nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Emma!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come downstairs? Mrs. Lake&rsquo;ll let us have
      her back room, and tea&rsquo;s waiting for you. I wonder how you <i>can</i> stay
      here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t come. I want to be alone, Kate. Tell them not to come up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you can&rsquo;t stay here all night, child!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t talk. I want to be alone. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll come down before long.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate withdrew and went to gossip with the people who were incessantly
      coming and going in the lower part of the house. The opening and shutting
      of the front door, the sound of voices, the hurrying feet upon the
      staircase, were audible enough to Emma. She heard, too, the crowds that
      kept passing along the street, their shouts, their laughter, the voices of
      the policemen bidding them move on. It was all a nightmare, from which she
      strove to awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length she was able to weep. Gazing constantly at the dead face, she
      linked it at last with some far-off memory of tenderness, and that brought
      her tears. She held the cold hand against her heart and eased herself with
      passionate sobbing, with low wails, with loving utterance of his name.
      Thus it happened that she did not hear when someone knocked lightly at the
      door and entered. A shadow across the still features told her of another&rsquo;s
      presence. Starting back, she saw a lady from whose pale, beautiful face a
      veil had just been raised. The stranger, who was regarding her with
      tenderly compassionate eyes, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am Mrs. Mutimer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma rose to her feet and drew a little apart. Her face fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They told me downstairs,&rsquo; Adela pursued, &lsquo;that I should find Miss Vine in
      the room. Is your name Emma Vine?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma asked herself whether this lady, his wife, could know anything of her
      story. It seemed so, from the tone of the question. She only replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she again ventured to look up at the woman whose beauty had made her
      life barren. There were no signs of tears on Adela&rsquo;s face; to Emma she
      seemed cold, though so grave and gentle. Adela gazed for a while at the
      dead man. She, too, felt as though it were all a dream. The spectacle of
      Emma&rsquo;s passionate grief had kept her emotion within her heart, perhaps had
      weakened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have yourself been hurt,&rsquo; she said, turning again to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma only shook her head. She suffered terribly from Adela&rsquo;s presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will go,&rsquo; she said in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is your room, I think?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I stay here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course&mdash;you must.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma was moving towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wish to go?&rsquo; Adela said, uttering the words involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I must.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela, left alone, stood gazing at the dead face. She did not kneel by her
      husband, as Emma had done, but a terrible anguish came upon her as she
      gazed; she buried her face in her hands. Her feeling was more of horror at
      the crime that had been committed than of individual grief. Yet grief she
      knew. The last words her husband had spoken to her were good and worthy;
      in her memory they overcame all else. That parting when he left home had
      seemed to her like the beginning of a new life for him. Could not his
      faults be atoned for otherwise than by this ghastly end? She had no need
      to direct her thoughts to the good that was in him. Even as she had taken
      his part against his traducers, so she now was stirred in spirit against
      his murderers. She felt a solemn gladness in remembering that she had
      stood before that meeting in the Clerkenwell room and served him as far as
      it was in a woman&rsquo;s power to do. All her long sufferings were forgotten;
      this supreme calamity of death outweighed them all. His enemies had
      murdered him; would they not continue to assail his name? She resolved
      that his memory should be her care. That had nothing to do with love;
      simple justice demanded it. Justice and gratitude for the last words he
      had spoken to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had as yet scarcely noticed the room in which she was. At length she
      surveyed it; its poverty brought tears in her eyes. There had been a fire,
      but the last spark was dead. She began to feel cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon there was the sound of someone ascending the stairs, and Emma, after
      knocking, again entered. She carried a tray with tea-things, which she
      placed upon the table. Then, having glanced at the fireplace, she took
      from a cupboard wood and paper and was beginning to make a fire when Adela
      stopped her, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must not do that for me. I will light the fire myself, if you will
      let me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma looked up in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is kind of you to bring me the tea,&rsquo; Adela continued. &lsquo;But let me do
      the rest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you wish to&mdash;yes,&rsquo; the other replied, without understanding the
      thought which prompted Adela. She carefully held herself from glancing
      towards the dead man, and moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela approached her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you a room for the night?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, thank you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you&mdash;will you take my hand before you leave me?&rsquo; She held it
      forth; Emma, with eyes turned to the ground, gave her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look at me,&rsquo; Adela said, under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met, and at last Emma understood. In that grave, noble gaze was
      far more than sympathy and tenderness; it was a look that besought pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I come to you in the night to see if you need anything?&rsquo; Emma asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall need nothing. Come only if you can&rsquo;t sleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela lit the fire and began her night&rsquo;s watching.

      CHAPTER XXXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      A deep breath of country air. It is springtime, and the valley of Wanley
      is bursting into green and flowery life, peacefully glad as if the foot of
      Demos had never come that way. Incredible that the fume of furnaces ever
      desecrated that fleece-sown sky of tenderest blue, that hammers clanged
      and engines roared where now the thrush utters his song so joyously.
      Hubert Eldon has been as good as his word. In all the valley no trace is
      left of what was called New Wanley. Once more we can climb to the top of
      Stanbury Hill and enjoy the sense of remoteness and security when we see
      that dark patch on the horizon, the cloud that hangs over Belwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert and the vicar of Wanley stood there together one morning in late
      April, more than a year after the death of Richard Mutimer. Generally
      there was a strong breeze on this point, but to-day the west was breathing
      its gentlest, warm upon the cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it has gone,&rsquo; Hubert said. &lsquo;May will have free playing-ground.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In one sense,&rsquo; replied the vicar, &lsquo;I fear it will never be gone. Its
      influence on the life of the people in Wanley and in some of the farms
      about has been graver than you imagine. I find discontent where it was
      formerly unknown. The typical case is that lad of Bolton&rsquo;s. They wanted
      him sadly at home; by this time he would have been helping his unfortunate
      father. Instead of that he&rsquo;s the revolutionary oracle of Belwick
      pot-houses, and appears on an average once a fortnight before the
      magistrates for being drunk and disorderly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, the march of progress has been hastened a little, doubtless,&rsquo; said
      Hubert. &lsquo;I have to content myself with the grass and the trees. Well, I
      have done all I could, now other people must enjoy the results. Ah, look!
      there is a van of the Edgeworths&rsquo; furniture coming to the Manor. They are
      happy people! Something like an ideal married couple, and with nothing to
      do but to wander about the valley and enjoy themselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am rather surprised you gave them so long a lease,&rsquo; remarked Mr.
      Wyvern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not? I shall never live here again. As long as I had work to do it
      was all right; but to continue to live in that house was impossible. And
      in twenty years it would be no less impossible. I should fall into a
      monomania, and one of a very loathsome kind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvern pondered. They walked on a few paces before Hubert again spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was a letter from her in the &ldquo;Belwick Chronicle&rdquo; yesterday morning
      Something on the placard in Agworth station caused me to buy a copy. The
      Tory paper, it seems, had a leader a day or two ago on Socialism, and took
      occasion to sneer at Mutimer, not by name, but in an unmistakable way&mdash;the
      old scandal of course. She wrote a letter to the editor, and he
      courteously paid no attention to it. So she wrote to the &ldquo;Chronicle.&rdquo; They
      print her in large type, and devote a leader to the subject&mdash;party
      capital, of course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He ceased on a bitter tone, then, before his companion could reply, added
      violently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is hideous to see her name in such places!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us speak freely of this,&rsquo; returned Mr. Wyvern. &lsquo;You seem to me to be
      very unjust. Your personal feeling makes you less acute in judging than I
      should have expected. Surely her behaviour is very admirable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I am not unjust in that sense. I have never refused to believe in his
      innocence technically.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excuse me, that has nothing to do with the matter. All we have to look at
      is this. She is herself convinced of his innocence, and therefore makes it
      her supreme duty to defend his memory. It appears to me that she acts
      altogether nobly. In spite of all the evidence that was brought on his
      side, the dastardly spirit of politics has persisted in making Mutimer a
      sort of historical character, a type of the hypocritical demagogue, to be
      cited whenever occasion offers. Would it be possible to attach a more evil
      significance to a man&rsquo;s name than that which Mutimer bears, and will
      continue to bear, among certain sections of writing and speechifying
      vermin? It is a miserable destiny. If every man who achieves notoriety
      paid for his faults in this way, what sort of reputations would history
      consist of? I won&rsquo;t say that it isn&rsquo;t a good thing, speaking generally,
      but in the individual case it is terribly hard. Would you have his widow
      keep silence? That would be the easier thing to do, be sure of it&mdash;for
      <i>her</i>, a thousand times the easier. I regard her as the one entirely
      noble woman it has been my lot to know. And if you thought calmly you
      could not speak of her with such impatience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert kept silence for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is all true. Of course it only means that I am savagely jealous. But I
      cannot&mdash;upon my life I cannot&mdash;understand her having given her
      love to such a man as that!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvern seemed to regard the landscape. There was a sad smile on his
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let there be an end of it,&rsquo; Hubert resumed. &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to say
      anything to you about the letter. Now, we&rsquo;ll talk of other things. Well, I
      am going to have a summer among the German galleries; perhaps I shall find
      peace there. You have let your son know that I am coming?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar nodded. They continued their walk along the top of the hill.
      Presently Mr. Wyvern stopped and faced his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you serious in what you said just now? I mean about her love for
      Mutimer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serious? Of course I am. Why should you ask such a question?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I find it difficult to distinguish between the things a young man
      says in jealous pique and the real belief he entertains when he is not
      throwing savage words about. You have convinced yourself that she loved
      her husband in the true sense of the word?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The conviction was forced upon me. Why did she marry him at all? What led
      her to give herself, heart and soul, to Socialism, she who under ordinary
      circumstances would have shrunk from that and all other <i>isms</i>? Why
      should she make it a special entreaty to me to pursue her husband&rsquo;s work?
      The zeal for his memory is nothing unanticipated; it issues naturally from
      her former state of mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your vehemence,&rsquo; replied the vicar, smiling, &lsquo;is sufficient proof that
      you don&rsquo;t think it impossible for all these questions to be answered in
      another sense. I can&rsquo;t pretend to have read the facts of her life
      infallibly, but suppose I venture a hint or two, just to give you matter
      for thought. Why she married him I cannot wholly explain to myself, but
      remember that she took that step very shortly after being brought to
      believe that you, my good friend, were utterly unworthy of any true
      woman&rsquo;s devotion. Remember, too, her brother&rsquo;s influence, and&mdash;well,
      her mother&rsquo;s. Now, on the evening before she accepted Mutimer she called
      at the Vicarage alone. Unfortunately I was away&mdash;was walking with
      you, in fact. What she desired to say to me I can only conjecture; but it
      is not impossible that she was driven by the common impulse which sends
      young girls to their pastor when they are in grievous trouble and without
      other friends.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did you never tell me of that?&rsquo; cried Hubert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because it would have been useless, and, to tell you the truth, I felt I
      was in an awkward position, not far from acting indiscreetly. I did go to
      see her the next morning, but only saw her mother, and heard of the
      engagement. Adela never spoke to me of her visit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But she may have come for quite other reasons. Her subsequent behaviour
      remains.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly. Here again I may be altogether wrong, but it seems to me that
      to a woman of her character there was only one course open. Having become
      his wife, it behoved her to be loyal, and especially&mdash;remember this&mdash;it
      behoved her to put her position beyond doubt in the eyes of others, in the
      eyes of one, it may be, beyond all. Does that throw no light on your
      meeting with her in the wood, of which you make so much?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert&rsquo;s countenance shone, but only for an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ingenious,&rsquo; he replied, good-humouredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Possibly no more,&rsquo; Mr. Wyvern rejoined. &lsquo;Take it as a fanciful sketch of
      how a woman&rsquo;s life <i>might</i> be ordered. Such a life would not lack its
      dignity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither spoke for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will call on Mrs. Westlake as you pass through London?&rsquo; Mr. Wyvern
      next inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Westlake?&rsquo; the other repeated absently. &lsquo;Yes, I dare say I shall see
      her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do, by all means.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They began to descend the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Walthams no longer lived in Wanley. A year ago the necessities of
      Alfred Waltham&rsquo;s affairs had led to a change; he and his wife and their
      two children, together with Mrs. Waltham the dowager, removed to what the
      auctioneers call a commodious residence on the outskirts of Belwick.
      Alfred remarked that it was as well not to be so far from civilisation; he
      pointed out, too, that it was time for him to have an eye to civic
      dignities, if only a place on the Board of Guardians to begin with. Our
      friend was not quite so uncompromising in his political and social
      opinions as formerly. His wife observed that he ceased to subscribe to
      Socialist papers, and took in a daily of orthodox Liberal tendencies&mdash;that
      is to say, an organ of capitalism. Letty rejoiced at the change, but knew
      her husband far too well to make any remark upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To their house, about three months after her husband&rsquo;s death, came Adela.
      The intermediate time she had passed with Stella. All were very glad to
      have her at Belwick&mdash;Letty in particular, who, though a matron with
      two bouncing boys, still sat at Adela&rsquo;s feet and deemed her the model of
      womanhood. Adela was not so sad as they had feared to find her. She kept a
      great deal to her own room, but was always engaged in study, and seemed to
      find peace in that way. She was silent in her habits, scarcely ever
      joining in general conversation; but when Letty could steal an hour from
      household duties and go to Adela&rsquo;s room she was always sure of hearing
      wise and tender words in which her heart delighted. Her pride in Adela was
      boundless. On the day when the latter first attired herself in modified
      mourning, Letty, walking with her in the garden, could not refrain from
      saying how Adela&rsquo;s dress became her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are more beautiful every day, dear,&rsquo; she added, in spite of a tremor
      which almost checked her in uttering a compliment which her sister might
      think too frivolous.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Adela blushed, one would have thought it was with pleasure. Sadness,
      however, followed, and Letty wondered whether the beautiful face was
      destined to wear its pallor always.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this same spring morning, when Hubert Eldon was taking leave of Wanley,
      Mrs. Waltham and Letty were talking of a visit Adela was about to pay to
      Stella in London. They spoke also of a visitor of their own, or, perhaps,
      rather of Adela&rsquo;s, who had been in the house for a fortnight and would
      return to London on the morrow. This was Alice Mutimer&mdash;no longer to
      be called Mrs. Rodman. Alice had lived with her mother in Wilton Square
      since her recovery from the illness which for a long time had kept her in
      ignorance of the double calamity fallen upon her. It was Adela who at
      length told her that she had no husband, and that her brother Richard was
      dead. Neither disclosure affected her gravely. The months of mental
      desolation followed by physical collapse seemed to have exhausted her
      powers of suffering. For several days she kept to herself and cried a good
      deal, but she exhibited no bitter grief. It soon became evident that she
      thought but little of the man who had so grossly wronged her; he was quite
      gone from her heart Even when she was summoned to give evidence against
      him in court, she did it without much reluctance, yet also without
      revengeful feeling; her state was one of enfeebled vitality, she was like
      a child in all the concerns of life. Rodman went into penal servitude, but
      it did not distress her, and she never again uttered his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela thought it would be a kindness to invite her to Belwick and Alice at
      once accepted the invitation. Yet she was not at her ease in the house.
      She appeared to have forgiven Adela, overcome by the latter&rsquo;s goodness,
      but her nature was not of the kind to grow in liberal feeling. Mrs.
      Waltham the elder she avoided as much as possible. Perhaps Letty best
      succeeded in conciliating her, for Letty was homely and had the children
      to help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I had a child,&rsquo; Alice said one day when she sat alone with Letty,
      and assisted in nursery duties. But at once her cheeks coloured. &lsquo;I
      suppose you&rsquo;re ashamed of me for saying that I&rsquo;m not even a married
      woman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty replied, as she well knew how to, very gently and with comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder where she goes to when she sets off by herself,&rsquo; said Mrs.
      Waltham this morning. &lsquo;She seems to object to walk with any of us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She always comes back in better spirits,&rsquo; said Letty. &lsquo;I think the change
      is doing her good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But she won&rsquo;t be sorry to leave us, my dear, I can see that. To be sure
      it was like Adela to think of having her here, but I scarcely think it
      would be advisable for the visit to be repeated. She is not at home with
      us. And how can it be expected? It&rsquo;s in her blood, of course; she belongs
      so distinctly to an inferior class.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am so very sorry for her,&rsquo; Letty replied. &lsquo;What dreadful things she has
      gone through!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dreadful, indeed, my dear; but after all such things don&rsquo;t happen to
      ladies. We must remember that. It isn&rsquo;t as if you or Adela had suffered in
      that way. That, of course, would be shocking beyond all words. I can&rsquo;t
      think that persons of her class have quite the same feelings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, mother!&rsquo; Letty protested. And she added, less seriously, &lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t
      let Alfred hear you say such a thing as that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad to say,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Waltham, &lsquo;that Alfred has grown much more
      sensible in his views of late.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela entered the room. Letty was not wrong in saying that she grew more
      beautiful. Life had few joys for her, save intellectual, but you saw on
      her countenance the light of freedom. In her manner there was an
      unconscious dignity which made her position in the house one of recognised
      superiority; even her mother seldom ventured to chat without reserve in
      her presence. Alfred drew up in the midst of a tirade if she but seemed
      about to speak. Yet it was happiness to live with her; where she moved
      there breathed an air of purity and sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked if Alice had returned from her walk. Receiving a reply in the
      negative, she went out into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Adela looks happy to-day,&rsquo; said Letty. &lsquo;That article in the paper has
      pleased her very much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I really hope she won&rsquo;t do such a thing again,&rsquo; remarked Mrs. Waltham,
      with dignified disapproval. &lsquo;It seems very unlady-like to write letters to
      the newspapers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it was brave of her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure, we must not judge her as we should ordinary people. Still, I
      am not sure that she is always right. I shall never allow that she did
      right in paying back that money to those wretches in London. I am sure she
      wanted it far more than they did. The bloodthirsty creatures!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty shuddered, but would not abandon defence of Adela.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Still it was very honourable of her, mother. She understands those things
      better than we can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps so, my dear,&rsquo; said Mrs. Waltham, meaning that her own opinion was
      not likely to be inferior in justice to that of anyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela had been in the garden for a few minutes when she saw Alice coming
      towards her. The poor Princess had a bright look, as if some joyful news
      had just come to her. Adela met her with a friendly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is someone you used to know,&rsquo; Alice said, speaking with
      embarrassment, and pointing towards the road. &lsquo;You remember Mr. Keene? I
      met him. He says he wrote that in the &ldquo;Chronicle.&rdquo; He would like to speak
      to you if you&rsquo;ll let him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be glad to,&rsquo; Adela replied, with a look of curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked to the garden gate. Mr. Keene was just outside; Alice beckoned
      to him to enter. His appearance was a great improvement on the old days;
      he had grown a beard, and in his eye you saw the responsible editor.
      Altogether he seemed to have gained in moral solidity. None the less, his
      manner of approaching Adela, hat in hand, awoke reminiscences of the
      footlights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a great pleasure to me to see you, Mrs. Mutimer. I trust that my
      few comments on your admirable letter were of a nature to afford you
      satisfaction.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you very much, Mr. Keene,&rsquo; Adela replied. &lsquo;You wrote very kindly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am amply rewarded,&rsquo; he said, bowing low. &lsquo;And now that I have had my
      desire, permit me to hasten away. My duty calls me into the town.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He again bowed low to Adela, smiled a farewell to Alice, and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two walked together in the garden. Adela turned to her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you knew Mr. Keene a long time ago?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, a long time. He once asked me to marry him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela replied only with a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he&rsquo;s asked me again this morning,&rsquo; Alice pursued, breaking off a leaf
      from an elder bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t refuse him this time,&rsquo; Alice replied with confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very glad, very glad. He has been faithful to you so long that I am
      sure he will make you happy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice no longer concealed her joy. It was almost exultation. Natural
      enough under the circumstances, poor, disinherited Princess! Once more she
      felt able to face people; once more she would have a name. She began to
      talk eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I shall just go back to tell mother, but we are going to be
      married in three weeks. He has already decided upon a house; we went to
      see it this morning. I didn&rsquo;t like to tell you, but I met him for the
      first time a week ago&mdash;quite by chance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid your mother will be lonely,&rsquo; Adela said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not she! She&rsquo;d far rather live alone than go anywhere else. And now I
      shall be able to send her money. It isn&rsquo;t fair for you to have to find
      everything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have wanted to ask you,&rsquo; Adela said presently, &lsquo;do you ever hear of
      Harry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The less we hear the better,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s gone to the bad, and
      there&rsquo;s no help for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true; unfortunate victim of prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Adela and Alice travelled to town together. The former did
      not go to Wilton Square. On the occasion of Richard&rsquo;s death she had met
      Mrs. Mutimer, but the interview had been an extremely difficult one, in
      spite of the old woman&rsquo;s endeavour to be courteous. Adela felt herself to
      be an object of insuperable prejudice. Once again she was bidden sound the
      depth of the gulf which lies between the educated and the uneducated. The
      old woman would not give her hand, but made an old-fashioned curtsey,
      which Adela felt to be half ironical. In speaking of her son she was hard.
      Pride would not allow her to exhibit the least symptom of the anguish
      which wrung her heart. She refused to accept any share of the income which
      was continued to her son&rsquo;s widow under the Wanley will. Alice, however,
      had felt no scruple in taking the half which Adela offered her, and by
      paying her mother for board and lodgings she supplemented the income
      derived from letting as much of the house as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more under the roof of her dearest friend, Adela was less preoccupied
      with the sad past which afflicted her mind with the stress of a duty ever
      harder to perform. After an hour passed with Stella she could breathe
      freely the atmosphere of beauty and love. Elsewhere she too often suffered
      from a sense of self-reproach; between her and the book in which she tried
      to lose herself there would come importunate visions of woe, of starved
      faces, of fierce eyes. The comfort she enjoyed, the affection and respect
      with which she was surrounded, were often burdensome to her conscience. In
      Stella&rsquo;s presence all that vanished; listening to Stella&rsquo;s voice she could
      lay firm hold on the truth that there is a work in the cause of humanity
      other than that which goes on so clamorously in lecture halls and at
      street corners, other than that which is silently performed by faithful
      hearts and hands in dens of misery and amid the horrors of the
      lazar-house; the work of those whose soul is taken captive of loveliness,
      who pursue the spiritual ideal apart from the world&rsquo;s tumult, and, ever
      ready to minister in gentle offices, know that they serve best when
      nearest home. She was far from spiritual arrogance; her natural mood was a
      profound humility; she deemed herself rather below than above the active
      toilers, whose sweat was sacred; but life had declared that such toil was
      not for her, and from Stella she derived the support which enabled her to
      pursue her path in peace&mdash;a path not one with Stella&rsquo;s. Before that
      high-throned poet-soul Adela bent in humble reverence. Between Stella and
      those toilers, however noble and devoted, there could be no question of
      comparison. She was of those elect whose part it is to inspire faith and
      hope, of those highest but for whom the world would fall into apathy or
      lose itself among subordinate motives. Stella never spoke of herself;
      Adela could not know whether she had ever stood at the severance of ways
      and made deliberate choice. Probably not, for on her brow was visible to
      all eyes the seal of election; how could she ever have doubted the leading
      of that spirit that used her lips for utterance?
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning after her arrival in London Adela took a long journey by
      herself to the far East End. Going by omnibus it seemed to her that she
      was never to reach that street off Bow Road which she had occasion to
      visit. But at last the conductor bade her descend, and gave her a brief
      direction The thoroughfare she sought was poor but not squalid she saw
      with pleasure that the house of which she had the number in mind was, if
      anything, cleaner and more homelike in appearance than its neighbours. A
      woman replied to her knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked if Miss Vine was at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, mum; she&rsquo;s at &lsquo;ome. Shall I tell her, or will you go up?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will go up, thank you. Which room is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Second floor front you&rsquo;ll find her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela ascended. Standing at the door she heard the hum of a
      sewing-machine. It made her heart sink, so clearly did it speak of
      incessant monotonous labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knocked loudly. The machine did not stop, but she was bidden to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma was at work, one of her sister&rsquo;s children sitting by her, writing on
      a slate. She had expected the appearance of the landlady; seeing who the
      visitor was, she let her hands fall abruptly; an expression of pain passed
      over her features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela went up to her and kissed her forehead, then exchanged a few words
      with the child. Emma placed a chair for her, but without speaking. The
      room was much like the other in which the sisters had lived, save that it
      had a brighter outlook. There were the two beds and the table covered with
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you find it better here?&rsquo; Adela began by asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it is better,&rsquo; Emma replied quietly. &lsquo;We manage to get a good deal
      of work, and it isn&rsquo;t badly paid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice was not uncheerful; it had that serenity which comes of duties
      honestly performed and a life tolerably free from sordid anxiety. More
      than that could not be said of Emma&rsquo;s existence. But, such as it was, it
      depended entirely upon her own effort. Adela, on the evening when she
      first met her in the room where Mutimer lay dead, had read clearly Emma&rsquo;s
      character; she knew that, though it was one of her strongest desires to
      lighten the burden of this so sorely tried woman, direct aid was not to be
      dreamt of. She had taken counsel with Stella, Stella with her husband.
      After much vain seeking they discovered an opportunity of work in this
      part of the East End. Mr. Westlake made it known to Emma; she acknowledged
      that it would be better than the over-swarmed neighbourhood in which she
      was living, and took the advice gratefully. She had hopes, too, that Kate
      might be got away from her evil companions. And indeed the change had not
      been without its effect on Mrs. Clay; she worked more steadily, and gave
      more attention to her children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s just gone with the eldest to the hospital,&rsquo; Emma replied to a
      question of Adela&rsquo;s. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s got something the matter with his eyes. And
      this one isn&rsquo;t at all well. He ought to be at school, only he&rsquo;s had such a
      dreadful cough we&rsquo;re afraid to send him out just yet. They&rsquo;re neither of
      them strong, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you&mdash;isn&rsquo;t your health better since you have lived here?&rsquo; Adela
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think so. But I never ail much as long as I have plenty of work to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am staying with a friend in London,&rsquo; Adela said after a pause. &lsquo;I
      thought I might come to see you. I hoped you would still be in the same
      house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, we are very comfortable, very,&rsquo; Emma replied. &lsquo;I hope we shan&rsquo;t need
      to move for a long time; I&rsquo;m sure we couldn&rsquo;t do better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She added, without raising her eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you for coming.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela knew that constraint between them was inevitable; it was enough that
      Emma spoke with good-will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If ever you should have to move,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;will you let me know where
      you go? I have written on this paper the address of my mother&rsquo;s house; I
      live with her. Will you show me so much friendship?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma glanced at her, and saw a look which recalled to her something she
      had seen in those eyes before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will write and tell you if we do move,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela went away with a heart not altogether sad; it was rather as though
      she had been hearing solemn music, which stirred her soul even while it
      touched upon the source of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only on certain days that Stella sat to receive during visitors&rsquo; 
      hours. To-day was not one of them; consequently when Hubert Eldon called,
      about half-past four, the servant came up to the drawing-room to ask if
      Mrs. Westlake would be at home to him. Adela was in the room; at the
      mention of the name she rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must write a letter before dinner,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I win go and get it done
      whilst you are engaged.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you stay? Do stay!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had much rather not. I don&rsquo;t feel able to talk with anyone just now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She left the room without meeting Stella&rsquo;s look. The latter said she would
      receive Mr. Eldon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela went to the exquisitely furnished little boudoir, which was now
      always called <i>her</i> room, and sat down with the resolve to write to
      her mother on the subjects she had in mind. But her strength of will
      proved unequal to the task; after writing a word or two with shaking hand
      she laid down her pen and rested her face upon her hands. A minute or two
      ago she had been untroubled by a thought which concerned herself; now her
      blood was hot, and all her being moved at the impulse of a passionate
      desire. She had never known such a rebellion of her life. In her ears
      there rang the word &lsquo;Free! free!&rsquo; She was free, and the man whom she loved
      with the love of years, with the first love of maidenhood and the
      confirmed love of maturity, was but a few yards from her&mdash;it might
      be, had even come here on purpose to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, why was he not poor! Had he but been some struggling artist, scarce
      able to support the woman of his choice, how would she have stood before
      him and let him read the tenderness on her face! Hubert&rsquo;s wealth was
      doubly hateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started from her chair, with difficulty suppressing a cry. Someone had
      knocked at her door. Perhaps he was already gone; she could not say how
      long she had sat here. It was Stella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Eldon wishes to speak to you, dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught her friend&rsquo;s hand and almost crushed it between her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t see him! Stella, I dare not see him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But he says it is purely a matter of business he wishes to speak of,&rsquo; 
      said Stella with a pained voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela sank her head in anguish of shame. Stella put an arm about her,
      fearing she would fall. But in an instant pride had sprung up; Adela freed
      herself, now deadly pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved mechanically, spoke mechanically the conventional words when she
      found that somehow she was in his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope I do not disturb you,&rsquo; Hubert said with equal self-control. &lsquo;I was
      about to address a letter to you before I left England. I did not know
      that you were here. It is better, perhaps, to do my business by word of
      mouth, if you will allow me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very courteous, but she could not distinguish a note in his voice
      that meant more than courtesy. She prayed him to be seated, and herself
      took a place on an ottoman. She was able very calmly to regard his face.
      He leaned forward with his hands together and spoke with his eyes on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is with regard to the legacy which is due to you under Mr. Mutimer&rsquo;s
      will. You will remember that, as trustee, I have it in my power to make
      over to you the capital sum which produces the annuity, if there should be
      reason for doing so. I am about to leave England, perhaps for some few
      years; I have let the Manor to some friends of mine on a twenty years&rsquo; 
      lease. I think I should like to transfer the money to you before I go. It
      is simpler, better. Will you let me do that, Mrs. Mutimer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His words chilled her. His voice seemed harder as he proceeded; it had the
      ring of metal, of hard cash counted down.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was his object? He wished to have done with her, to utterly abolish
      all relations between them. It might well be that he was about to marry,
      and someone abroad, someone who would not care to live in an English
      country house. Why otherwise should he have let the Manor for so long a
      period? She felt as she had done long ago, when she heard of that other
      foreign woman. Cold as ice; not a spark of love in all her being.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you. If you are willing to make that change, perhaps it will be
      best.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert, his eyes still on her, imagined he saw pleasure in her face. She
      might have a project for the use of the money, some Socialist scheme,
      something perhaps to preserve the memory of her husband. He rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In that case I will have a deed prepared at once, and you shall be
      informed when it is ready for signature.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He said to himself that she could not forgive his refusal of her request
      that day in the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands, Adela saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are still busy with art?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In my dilettante way,&rsquo; he replied smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela returned to her room, and there remained till the hour of dinner. At
      the meal she was her ordinary self. Afterwards Mr. Westlake asked her to
      read in proof an article about to appear in the &lsquo;Beacon&rsquo;; she did so, and
      commented upon it with a clear mind. In the course of the evening she told
      her friends of the arrangement between Mr. Eldon and herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later she had to call at the solicitor&rsquo;s office to sign the deed
      of release. Incidentally she learnt that Hubert was leaving England the
      same evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she been at home, these days would have been spent in solitude. For
      the first time she suffered in Stella&rsquo;s company. All allusion to Hubert
      was avoided between them. Sometimes she could hardly play her part;
      sickness of the soul wasted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was morning; he was now on the Continent, perhaps already talking with
      someone he loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was ashamed to have so deceived herself; she had feared him, because
      she believed he loved her, and that by sympathy he might see into her
      heart. Had it been so, he could not have gone from her in this way.
      Forgetting her own pride, her own power of dissimulation, she did not
      believe it possible for him so to disguise tenderness. She would listen to
      no argument of hope, but crushed her heart with perverse cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The annual payment of money had been a link between him and her; when she
      signed the deed releasing him, the cold sweat stood on her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would reason. Of what excellence was he possessed that her life should
      so abandon itself at his feet? In what had he proved himself generous or
      capable of the virtues that subdue? Such reasoning led to self-mockery.
      She was no longer the girl who questioned her heart as to the significance
      of the vows required in the marriage service; in looking back upon those
      struggles she could have wept for pity. Love would submit to no analysis;
      it was of her life; as easy to account for the power of thought. Her soul
      was bare to her and all its needs. There was no refuge in ascetic resolve,
      in the self-deceit of spiritual enthusiasm. She could say to herself: You
      are free to love him; then love and be satisfied. Could she, when
      a-hungered, look on food, and bid her hunger be appeased by the act of
      sight?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus long she had held up, but despair was closing in upon her, and an
      anguish worse than death. She must leave this house and go where she might
      surrender herself to misery. There was no friend whose comfort could be
      other than torment and bitter vanity; such woe as hers only time and
      weariness could aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was rising with the firm purpose of taking leave of Stella when a
      servant came to her door, announcing that Mr. Eldon desired to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was incredulous, required the servant to repeat the name. Mr. Eldon
      was in the drawing-room and desired to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There must have been some error, some oversight in the legal business. Oh,
      it was inhuman to torture her in this way! Careless of what her
      countenance might indicate, she hastened to the drawing-room. She could
      feign no longer. Let him think what he would, so that he spoke briefly and
      released her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as soon as she entered the room she knew that he had not come to talk
      of business. He was pale and agitated. As he did not speak at once she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought you were gone. I thought you left England last night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I meant to do so, but found it impossible. I could not go till I had seen
      you once more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What more have you to say to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew that she was speaking recklessly, without a thought for dignity.
      Her question sounded as if it had been extorted from her by pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That if I go away from you now and finally, I go without a hope to
      support my life. You are everything to me. You are offended; you shrink
      from me. It is what I expected. Years ago, when I loved you without
      knowing what my love really meant, I flung away every chance in a moment
      of boyish madness. When I should have consecrated every thought to the
      hope of winning you, I made myself contemptible in your eyes&mdash;worse,
      I made you loathe me. When it was too late I understood what I had done.
      Then I loved you as a man loves the one woman whom he supremely
      reverences, as I love you, and, I believe, shall always love you. I could
      not go without saying this to you. I am happier in speaking the words than
      I ever remember to have been in my life before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela&rsquo;s bosom heaved, but excess of joy seemed to give her power to deal
      lightly with the gift that was offered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did you not say this the last time?&rsquo; she asked. One would have said,
      from her tone, that it was a question of the merest curiosity. She did not
      realise the words that passed her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because the distance between us seemed too great. I began to speak of
      that money in the thought that it might lead me on. It had the opposite
      effect. You showed me how cold you could be. It is natural enough. Perhaps
      your sympathies are too entirely remote; and yet not long ago you talked
      with me as if your interests could be much the same as mine. I can
      understand that you suppress that side of your nature. You think me
      useless in the world. And indeed my life has but one purpose, which is a
      vain one. I can do nothing but feed my love for you. You have convictions
      and purposes; you feel that they are opposed to mine. All that is of the
      intellect; I only live in my passion. We are different and apart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you say that, as if you were glad of it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Glad? I speak the words that come to my tongue. I say aloud to you what I
      have been repeating again and again to myself. It is mere despair.&rsquo;

      &lsquo;You disregard those differences which you say are only of the intellect,
      and still love me. Can I not do the same? There <i>was</i> a distance
      between us, and my ends were other than yours. That is the past; the
      present is mine to make myself what you would have me. I have no law but
      your desire&mdash;so much I love you.&rsquo;

      How easily said after all! And when he searched her face with eyes on fire
      with their joy, when he drew her to his heart in passionate triumph, the
      untruth of years fell from her like a veil, and she had achieved her
      womanhood.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
