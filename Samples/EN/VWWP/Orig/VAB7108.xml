                    <p><hi>MISS BROWN</hi> felt very excited as the brougham drew up at Mrs
                        Argiropoulo’s, and they entered her large house, blazing with lights and
                        crammed with flowers. She followed Mrs Spencer timidly up‐stairs; but the
                        men who crowded the landing never guessed that this majestic and
                        imperturbable creature could possibly be nervous. At the top of the stairs,
                        receiving her guests, an occupation (called seeing a few friends) which
                        excluded her from her own drawing‐room the best part of the evening, was Mrs
                        Argiropoulo, gorgeous in old lace and diamonds, and withal excessively
                        vulgar.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="VAB7108-003"/>
                    <p>“I am <emph>so</emph> glad to see you, dear Miss Brown,” she exclaimed to
                        Anne’s astonishment, despatching the other comers with a mere frigid
                        handshake. “I do think it is <emph>so</emph> good of you to come.”</p>
                    <p>“I wanted to come.”</p>
                    <p>“You are <emph>such</emph> a darling,” went on the fat Greek lady. “Come
                        along—I have kept seats for you and Mrs Spencer for the recitation. Dear old
                        Gosselin is going to recite for us—he is staying with us. I beg your
                        pardon”—this last remark was addressed to a compact crowd of ladies and
                        gentlemen on the threshold of the largest reception‐room, into which the
                        lady of the house summarily elbowed her way.</p>
                    <p>“Follow me,” she whispered, as Anne, bewildered among the lights and noise,
                        tried to pick her way over the trailing skirts, and every one turned to
                        stare as she passed—“Here, Euphrosyne”—perceiving one of her big bouncing
                        daughters in the crowd—“I want to introduce you to Miss Brown. Do<pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7108-004"/> keep that chair to the left for the Duchess of
                        Orkney—mind.”</p>
                    <p>The spacious drawing‐room was filled, as for a theatrical performance, with
                        rows of chairs, wellnigh occupied already. Into the very first of these Mrs
                        Argiropoulo led Anne and Mrs Spencer.</p>
                    <p>“Sit down,” she whispered. “I do hope you’ll enjoy yourself, Miss Brown.
                        You’ll hear Gosselin beautifully here. Oh dear, there’s the dear Marchioness
                        of Epsom; goodbye”—and she whirled off her portly person.</p>
                    <p>“Goodness!” whispered Mrs Spencer, “old Argey has actually put us into the
                        best places!”</p>
                    <p>Anne looked round. In front was a vacant space, with an open piano, and some
                        chairs in a corner facing the company. All round and behind were chairs, and
                        only a little gangway remained leading to the piano, next to where Mrs
                        Argiropoulo had placed Anne. She had never seen such a crowd of
                        magnificently and oddly dressed people in her life. Old ladies in velvet and
                            diamonds,<pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7108-005"/> young ones in Worth toilets,
                        or weirdly attired in lank robes and draperies, with garlands of lilies or
                        turbans, or strings of sequins in their disorderly locks.</p>
                    <p>“I scarcely know any one here,” said Mrs Spencer, looking round like a rapid
                        little bird, “except one or two artists—there are three or four
                        R.A.’s—horrible creatures, to think the public is so wickedly infatuate as
                        to buy their pictures! Will Englishmen ever have any poetic feeling in art?
                        Papa would rather die than be an Academician. There’s little Thaddy
                        O’Reilly—horrid little jackanapes—in the door. That old flat‐faced man is
                        Lord Durrant, the critic. All the frumpy people with the diamonds must be
                        peeresses, I’m sure. There’s Cosmo Chough just come in,—they’re all looking
                        about for somebody or other. There’s Browning talking to old Argiropoulo.
                        Oh, here’s little Thaddy! How do you do, Mr O’Reilly?”</p>
                    <p>Mr O’Reilly, a callow critic who united æstheticism with frivolity, bowed,
                        and cast<pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7108-006"/> curious glances at Anne. For a
                        moment she felt horribly ungrateful about the dress. She was sure that
                        little O’Reilly was thinking that it was a night‐gown.</p>
                    <p>“Who’s the lion to‐night?” asked Mrs Spencer.</p>
                    <p>Mr O’Reilly fixed his eyes on Anne, and answered languidly, with a faint
                        smile—</p>
                    <p>“Why, how can you ask, Mrs Spencer? Have we not all been invited expressly to
                        meet Monsieur Gosselin and his charming friends, the ladies from the French
                        comedy? No one comes to see lions or lionesses here, it is much too
                        intellectual for that.”</p>
                    <p>“Do tell me who <emph>is</emph> the lion of to‐night,” asked Mrs Spencer,
                        laughing.</p>
                    <p>“Haven’t I told you that there never <emph>are</emph> lions here? only an
                        occasional man of genius, shipped over fresh, between petroleum tins and
                        sewing‐machines, from America, may stray in in top‐boots and a red flannel
                        shirt—or it so happens that a beautiful woman is first noticed here—or
                        Victor Hugo walks in<pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7108-007"/> quite casually to
                        tea—or the ghost of Byron mistakes this for Westminster Abbey. Oh, no lions,
                        never. Besides, here <emph>is</emph> Monsieur Gosselin, and here is
                        Mademoiselle Meringue and Madame Gauffre just come in. You see, Miss Brown,
                        how perfectly true it is that we are to meet them. They are taking their
                        place behind the piano. Yes, that is Madame Gauffre with the diamond
                        butterfly. You perceive how we are to have the pleasure of making their
                        acquaintance. Do you remark the vacant space round the piano? Miss
                        Euphrosyne Argiropoulo and her sister are alone privileged to enter it, and
                        the waiters also, to talk to Monsieur Gosselin and his fair comrades, and
                        offer them refreshments. It is what I call a moral <foreign xml:lang="fre">cordon sanitaire</foreign>, separating these <foreign xml:lang="fre">artistes</foreign> from the highly respectable company all round.”</p>
                    <p>“How horrible!” said Anne; “and do they pay them to be insulted like
                        that?”</p>
                    <p>“Pay them? oh, never. The Argiropoulos are far too delicate for that.
                            Monsieur<pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7108-008"/> Gosselin and mesdames of the
                        comedy are intimate friends of the house: they have been dining here, and
                        they are so kind as to recite a piece or two to Mrs Argiropoulo’s guests.
                        Let me see—what’s he going to recite—ah—‘Un Beignet.’ That will be
                        delicious.”</p>
                    <p>Gosselin had come forward, his opera‐hat in his hand, and begun to recite. It
                        was a very delightful performance, and Anne enjoyed it greatly. Besides, it
                        was a great relief to find that this entertainment was a performance, and
                        not as she had dreaded, a series of introductions and conversations with
                        celebrities. There was a dead silence during Gosselin’s recitation, except
                        near the door, where people kept pressing in and out. When he had ceased,
                        Anne looked round. She was surprised at the aspect of many of the company.
                        They had evidently not been listening at all, but looking about, straining
                        to see some one in the front rows. In a minute the little gangway leading to
                        the piano was crowded.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7108-009"/>
                    <p>Posthlethwaite, whom she had met several times before, was elbowing his
                        unwieldy person—a Japanese lily bobbing out of the button‐hole of his
                        ancestral dress‐coat—towards her. He had scarcely begun a description of a
                        picture which he had just seen, representing “Aphrodite tripping with pink
                        little feet across the dimpled sea sands,” when Mrs Argiropoulo came up with
                        several gentlemen about her, whom she began rapidly to introduce to Anne:
                        two of them were famous painters; one a well‐known sculptor; another was an
                        aristocratic drawing‐room novelist; the fifth a man of fashion. They all
                        stood in the gangway around Anne’s chair, while Posthlethwaite, who was not
                        the person to be ousted, propped his elephantine person against the end of
                        the piano, and leaning down his flabby flat‐cheeked face and mop of tow,
                        continued conversing with Miss Brown, regardless of the new‐comers, who
                        exchanged smiles as they listened to him with much more amused attention
                        than they had listened to<pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7108-010"/> Gosselin. Anne was
                        very bewildered; and as she answered the remarks of the party surrounding
                        her, she became aware that the people behind were all looking in her
                        direction—looking, doubtless, at Gosselin and his ladies behind the piano,
                        or at Posthlethwaite. For a moment Anne turned round, wondering whether she
                        should see Hamlin. But instead of Hamlin, her eyes met a face as familiar as
                        his—a dark, rather snub face, with bushy black beard and hair, which emerged
                        high above the heads of a knot of literary and political celebrities. She
                        started imperceptibly, but turned away, and looked towards the piano, where
                        Madame Gauffre had begun to recite, her plump little black figure standing
                        out against the moonlight flooding through the window, in strange contrast
                        to the yellow light of the room, in which dimly loomed the tops of trees and
                        the towers of Westminster. Could it be her cousin Dick? Anne rarely mistook
                        people’s faces, and least of all was it possible for her to mistake<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7108-011"/> Richard Brown’s, though she had not seen
                        him since that morning in Florence. But what should Richard be doing here,
                        in this fashionable party? It was evidently a mere accidental resemblance,
                        but it brought up a painful train of thought. Anne had once or twice written
                        to her cousin and guardian from school, in a formal cold way, and he had let
                        her know that he had become a partner in the military foundry, and had
                        changed his address. She had got a vague idea that he was now rich. But she
                        had not yet let him know of her arrival in England, and she felt ungrateful
                        and rather ashamed, for, after all, he had always wished her well, and had
                        been her playfellow. If he should have thought that she was ashamed of him?
                        Heaven knows that was not her feeling, but she felt against Richard Brown a
                        vague, instinctive aversion, as to something insulting and degrading to
                        herself. She determined, however, to write to him the very next day.</p>
                    <p>With a shrill exclamation and a pert curtsy,<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7108-012"/>
                        Madame Gauffre, who was reciting the part of a schoolgirl of fifteen,
                        suddenly came to an end.</p>
                    <p>“How do you do, Annie?” said a voice behind her.</p>
                    <p>She turned round. It was Richard Brown.</p>
                    <p>“I saw you as soon as I came in,” he said, calmly pushing aside the
                        astonished Posthlethwaite, “but I have only now been able to make my way
                        here. How do you like Madame Gauffre? don’t you think she’s delightful? or
                        rather, I ought to ask, how do you like London?”</p>
                    <p>The voice was always that same deep one, which, when lowered to a whisper,
                        had something curiously hot and passionate about it; but the accent and the
                        easy worldly manner seemed as if they could not belong to Richard Brown.</p>
                    <p>“Who the deuce is that fellow?” asked Posthlethwaite angrily of Mrs
                        Spencer.</p>
                    <p>“<emph>I</emph> don’t know—I’ve never seen him. Do you know, Mr O’Reilly, who
                        that big black man is, that has just come up to Miss Brown. Not one of
                            <emph>our</emph> set, that’s certain.”</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7108-013"/>
                    <p>“Oh Lord, no!” answered the little journalist. “You don’t read newspapers in
                        your set, do you?”</p>
                    <p>“We always read the ‘Athenæum,’” answered Mrs Spencer, seriously.</p>
                    <p>“Newspapers are Cimmerian inventions,” said Posthlethwaite. “I’m a
                        republican, red, incarnadine, a <foreign xml:lang="fre">démocrate</foreign>
                        for Robespierre; but I never take up a paper, except to see which of my
                        friends have left town.”</p>
                    <p>Thaddy O’Reilly laughed. “Oh, well, you won’t find Education Brown in the
                        ‘Athenæum,’ Mrs Spencer—a mere barbarian, Goth, Philistine, but well known
                        in Philistia. He’s a tremendous Radical, goes in for disestablishment,
                        secular teaching; an awful fellow for obligatory education and paupers;
                        he’ll be in Parliament some day soon, for he’s backed by all the black
                        trade.”</p>
                    <p>“Surely it is very easy to feed paupers, as people used to, don’t you know,
                        in Chaucer?” said Mrs Spencer, simply and seriously.</p>
                    <pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7108-014"/>
                    <p>Young O’Reilly went into an inaudible but convulsive giggle.</p>
                    <p>“Anyhow, that’s Brown—‘Peace by Expensive Warfare Brown’ we call him. Look at
                        him; he’s a force in his world, as your father is in yours.”</p>
                    <p>“I wish he’d keep in his own coal‐cinders,” retorted Posthlethwaite. “What
                        business has he to talk to—”</p>
                    <p>“By Jove!” exclaimed O’Reilly, “it never struck me,—Anne Brown—Richard
                        Brown,—perhaps they’re relations!”</p>
                    <p>“What do you think of her?” whispered Mrs Argiropoulo to the little knot of
                        artists whom she had assembled.</p>
                    <p>Posthlethwaite, as usual, answered for the company.</p>
                    <p>“’Tis the body of a goddess; we must give it the soul of a woman.”</p>
                    <p>“That’s Hamlin’s look‐out,” answered Paints, the R.A.</p>
                    <p>“Why, what’s become of him?” they all asked. “Surely he was to be here.”</p>
                    <pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7108-015"/>
                    <p>“Oh, be sure he’s lurking around here,” answered O’Reilly; “of course he
                        keeps in the background—enjoys his triumph from afar. You don’t sit in front
                        of your own picture on the first Academy day, do you, Paints?”</p>
                    <p>“Mr Posthlethwaite, will you take Miss Brown in to supper?” cried Mrs
                        Argiropoulo, who was working up and down the crowd.</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown had already given Anne his arm.</p>
                    <p>“That can’t be,” cried Mrs Argiropoulo. “Mr Posthlethwaite <emph>must</emph>
                        take you in, dear. Dear Mr Brown, will you take in my daughter?”</p>
                    <p>“Good‐bye, Annie,” whispered Richard Brown. “I will come and see you
                        to‐morrow.” And he let his cousin be borne away in triumph by
                        Posthlethwaite.</p>
                    <p>“Of course, Mr Posthlethwaite must take in Miss Brown,” explained Mrs
                        Argiropoulo to Mrs Spencer; “he’s the most conspicuous man, after all; and,
                        as it were, it stamps her at once. By the way, two R.A.’s, Paints and<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7108-016"/> Smeers, have already said that they would
                        like to paint her.”</p>
                    <p>“Walter Hamlin will never let her be painted by an R.A.,” answered Mrs
                        Spencer, fiercely; “and Annie has far too much artistic feeling to endure
                        such a thing. Why, Mr Bones has been drawing her for the last week, and papa
                        made a crayon of her.”</p>
                    <p>As Anne passed through the crowd on Posthlethwaite’s arm every one turned to
                        look at her. And then it suddenly flashed upon her that she was the person
                        people had been staring at, <emph>she</emph> was the lion of the
                        evening—she, the servant whom the great poet‐painter had adopted. Every one
                        was looking at her; she felt horribly alone, numb, unreal.</p>
                    <p>At that moment Hamlin came up.</p>
                    <p>“Have you amused yourself?” he asked. “Why, what’s the matter? do you feel
                        ill?”</p>
                    <p>“Only very tired. Oh, why didn’t you turn up before?” Anne’s voice was so
                        wretched and supplicating that Hamlin felt quite terrified.</p>
                    <pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7108-017"/>
                    <p>“Where’s Mrs Spencer?” he asked. “It must be that hot room. Edith, do take
                        Miss Brown home, she looks so awfully tired.”</p>
                    <p>“Permit me to take you down‐stairs,” said the mellifluous fat voice of
                        Posthlethwaite.</p>
                    <p>“I will take Miss Brown down myself, if you please, Posthlethwaite;” and
                        Hamlin pushed the prince of æsthetes roughly aside.</p>
                    <p>“Why did you not show yourself the whole evening?” asked Anne feebly, while
                        he was helping her on with her cloak.</p>
                    <p>“Why—because—I thought I had no right to monopolise you always,” answered
                        Hamlin in a whisper.</p>
                    <p>When the two women were alone in the brougham, Anne could stand it no longer;
                        and leaning her head in the corner, she began to cry.</p>
                    <p>“Why, what’s the matter, Annie?” cried Mrs Spencer, drawing her close to her.
                        “What’s the matter, my dear girl?”</p>
                    <p>“Nothing—nothing,” answered Anne, wiping her eyes. “I suppose it is because I
                        am so worn‐out—so—”</p>
                    <pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7108-018"/>
                    <p>“It’s that vile, ostentatious party,” replied the little woman, half in
                        consolation, half in pride—“mere stupid crushes—no real society, as
                            <emph>we</emph> have it. And I do think it <emph>is</emph> so disgusting
                        of Mrs Argiropoulo to make all the people stare at you as if you were a
                        burlesque actress. Oh, I know that set of lion‐hunting, purse‐proud,
                        would‐be artistic people. They would have your photograph in all the
                        shop‐windows at once, and Royal Highnesses to meet you. Papa and I always
                        wonder that Walter hasn’t cut all those horrid sycophants before. You know
                        that it’s only artists and poets of our school who will ever appreciate you
                        really, although the others would hawk you about as a sort of professional
                        beauty.”</p>

                        prominent artistic set, and accepted as such by the rest of society, would
                        have greatly disturbed almost any woman. But Anne Brown’s nature was too
                        completely homogeneous—too completely without the innumerable strata, and
                        abysses, and peaks, and winding ways of modern women’s characters—for her to
                        experience any of the mixed feelings of pride, and disgust, and humiliation,

                        complex nature. The atoms of her character were not easily shaken into new
                        patterns: it was coherent, and, like most coherent things, difficult to
                        upset, slow to move, and quick to settle down.</p>
                    <pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7108-020"/>
                    <p>After the first shock of surprise, she resigned herself, without doubts, or
                        diffidence, or elation, to her new place. That she was more beautiful than
                        other women had indeed never occurred to her before; but once that it had
                        been proved to her she accepted it as a fact, as she had accepted as a fact
                        the still stranger news that Hamlin had singled her out to change her life
                        and love her. She did not take it at all as a merit or any other exciting
                        thing in herself: the only effect which it had upon her was to strengthen a
                        curious feeling, constitutional in her, and resulting probably from the very
                        coherence and weightiness of her character, that she was fated to be or do
                        something different from other women—a sort of sense of tragic passiveness,
                        which always formed the background of her happiness. Moreover, the discovery
                        which she had made at Mrs Argiropoulo’s somehow made Anne’s position more
                        intelligible and simple to herself. She had heard of other men who had
                        educated and married girls of the lower orders on account<pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7108-021"/> of their beauty. Hamlin’s behaviour was now no
                        longer a mystery to her; and the absence of mystery served merely, to Anne’s
                        quite unromantic, practically passionate, half‐southern temper, to make
                        Hamlin’s nobleness and goodness more obvious to her. She had the curious
                        Italian capacity for feeling an ideal passion—a passion which was merely a
                        sublimated form of friendship and admiration—for a real personality; and her
                        instinctive desire was merely to get nearer that real personality. But much
                        as she tried, the reality of Hamlin seemed to escape and baffle her: he was
                        a complex man, and she a homogeneous woman; and as she could not see Hamlin
                        well in detail, she loved him in the very simple and broad outlines which
                        she was able to comprehend.</p>
                    <p>Now that she had settled down in æsthetic society, and found her place, and
                        got to understand the main points of things, she was quite ideally happy.
                        Her life was very full, and was surrounded by a flood of love,—on her side
                        or on Hamlin’s? She scarcely knew; but she<pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7108-022"/>
                        knew that she was happy. By this time the round of sight‐seeing, play‐going,
                        excursions, and introductions, was over; her life had subsided into the
                        normal. Its object, she felt, as one feels a wholesome and agreeable desire
                        for food or sleep, was to make herself as worthy as possible of Hamlin, or
                        rather to let him find in her the best possible bargain. She worked very
                        hard at all the things which the school had left incomplete,—at what, living
                        in that æsthetic society, seemed to her the solid requisites of life. She
                        read history and biography and poetry, with the determination with which
                        other girls, anticipating marriage, might study manuals of domestic economy;
                        and she worked at developing her taste in art and music as others might have
                        practised cooking or dressmaking; for these were the things which would be
                        requisite in Hamlin’s spiritual household. The people around her, the men
                        and women of Hamlin’s set, seemed to her as necessary, as inevitable, as
                        normal as the trees and houses all round. Some of them<pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7108-023"/> she liked, and some she disliked; but their
                        ideas, though sometimes absurd caricatures, and their tempers, though often
                        intolerable, seemed to Anne quite natural and proper in the main, though
                        rendered ridiculous or disagreeable in individuals. Indeed she got rather to
                        believe in imperfect individuals,—being thus constantly either made cross by
                        the touchiness, the morbidness, the disgusting fleshliness, the intolerance
                        of the æsthetes around her, or made to laugh by their affectations, their
                        vanity, their inconsistency, their grotesque manias of wickedness and
                        mysticism—while unable to judge or condemn the general, intellectual, and
                        moral condition of which these individual excrescences were the result.</p>
                    <p>Some of the people were distinctly repulsive, or distinctly boring, or
                        distinctly annoying to her; others, like Mrs Spencer and her father and
                        mother and sisters, decidedly lovable; others, like little Chough, decidedly
                        amusing and amiable: and she took them as they came, but with the
                        indifference of <choice>
                            <orig>con‐<pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7108-024"/> centrated</orig>
                            <reg>concentrated</reg>
                        </choice> feeling; for what did it matter whether she cared for them, or
                        they cared for her, as long as she was doing her best to deserve Hamlin?</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile Anne Brown read quantities of medieval and Elizabethan literature;
                        went with Hamlin to see pictures and hear music; studied Dante and
                        Shakespeare—the algebra and arithmetic, so to speak, of the æsthetic set—and
                        even began, secretly, to work at a Greek grammar. Twice a‐week Cosmo Chough
                        came to practise her accompaniments with her; and twice a‐week also, of an
                        evening, friends dropped in at the house at Hammersmith, when Mrs Macgregor
                        would leave her nephew and niece, as she called her, to entertain the
                        guests. On other evenings Anne would usually go to the house of one of the
                        set, where literature and art, and the faults of friends, and the
                        wrong‐headedness of the public, were largely discussed; music was made,
                        young long‐haired Germans on the loose performing; and poets, especially
                            the<pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7108-025"/> inexhaustible Chough, would recite
                        their compositions, perched on the arms of sofas, or stretched on the
                        hearth‐rug; while the ladies went to sleep, or pretended to do so, over the
                        descriptions of the kisses of cruel, blossom‐mouthed women, who sucked out
                        their lovers’ hearts, bit their lips, and strewed their apartments with
                        coral‐like drops of blood. Most of these poets, as Anne speedily discovered,
                        were young men of harmless lives, and altogether unacquainted with the
                        beautiful, baleful ladies they represented as sucking at their vitals; and
                        none was more utterly harmless than Cosmo Chough. Instead of the terrible
                        Faustinas, Messalinas, and Lucretia Borgias to whom his poems were
                        addressed, the poor little man had in his miserable home in the north of
                        London a wife older than himself, often bedridden and always half crazy, who
                        turned the house in a sort of disorderly litter, neglected her children, and
                        vented on her husband the most jealous and perverse temper; but the victim
                        of Venus, as he styled himself,<pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7108-026"/> nursed her
                        with absolute devotion, denied himself every gratification to allow her a
                        servant and send his children to school, and made all new‐comers believe
                        that Mrs Cosmo Chough was the most angelic invalid that the world had ever
                        seen. People in the set had got accustomed to this fact, and treated Chough
                        merely as an amusing little caricature of genius; but when Anne understood
                        the real state of the case, she was deeply touched, and possessed with a
                        violent desire to help the little man. He could not, indeed, restrain his
                        habit of alluding in pompous language to Phryne, Pasiphaë, La Belle
                        Heaulmière, Madame du Barry, and all the most celebrated improprieties of
                        all times and nations; nor from discussing the most striking literary
                        obscenities, from Petronius to Walt Whitman. But although at first surprised
                        (as every one was surprised and indeed shocked) by Anne’s unblushing and
                        quietly resolute—“I think you had better leave that subject alone, Mr
                        Chough”—he became quite devoted to Anne.<pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7108-027"/>
                        When he gave a set of lectures, in Mrs Spencer’s house, on what was
                        nominally Elizabethan drama, but virtually the unmentionable play of Ford,
                        and the ladies dropped off one by one and merely laughed at poor Cosmo’s
                        eccentricities, Anne had the courage to sit out the performance, and to tell
                        Chough openly that he ought to be ashamed of himself for holding forth on
                        such subjects—a proceeding which made Hamlin’s friends blame Miss Brown for
                        want of womanly feeling and prudishness alike; and which put Hamlin just a
                        little out of temper, until she answered his unspoken censure by remarking,
                        with a sort of Italian bluntness and seriousness, that a woman of her age
                        had no business not to understand the real meaning of such things, and
                        understanding them, not to let the poets know that she would not tolerate
                        them.</p>
                    <p>“You see, it enters into their artistic effects,” explained Mrs Spencer. “I
                        don’t like such things personally, but of course everything is legitimate in
                        art.”</p>
                    <pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7108-028"/>
                    <p>“They may be legitimate in art,” answered Anne, sceptically, “but they shan’t
                        be legitimate in my presence.”</p>
                    <p>To return to Chough. Anne gradually became the confidant of the domestic
                        difficulties, though not of the domestic shame, of the little poet; and to
                        every one’s great astonishment, she obtained Hamlin’s permission to have one
                        of Chough’s little girls at Hammersmith every Saturday till Monday, and
                        tried to instil into the miserable puny imps some notion of how to behave
                        and how to amuse themselves.</p>
                    <p>“You are not going to take that child out in the carriage with you, surely?”
                        asked Hamlin, the first Sunday that Maggy Chough spent at Hammersmith.</p>
                    <p>“Of course I am,” answered Anne. “She’s the daughter of your most intimate
                        friend; surely you can’t grudge the poor little thing some amusement. And I
                        want you to go with us to the Zoo, Mr Hamlin. I’m sure it’s much more
                        fascinating than the Grosvenor or the Elgin rooms.”</p>
                    <pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7108-029"/>
                    <p>Hamlin smiled; and next day made a crayon drawing of Anne, one of the dozens
                        in his studio, with Chough’s child; but he managed to make Anne look
                        mournfully mysterious, and the child haggard and wild, so that people
                        thought it represented Medea and one of the children of Jason.</p>
                    <p>So far Anne’s acquaintance were entirely limited to the æsthetic set; but
                        there were two exceptions. One was a couple of sisters, Mary and Marjory
                        Leigh, who existed as it were on the borderland—Mary Leigh being a sort of
                        amateur painter with strong literary proclivities; the other was Richard
                        Brown, who, after the meeting at Mrs Argiropoulo’s, called at Hammersmith,
                        was politely received by Hamlin, with whom he appeared quite reconciled, and
                        talked on a variety of indifferent subjects, as if Anne Brown had never been
                        his ward. Hamlin had apparently never appeared to him in the light of a
                        slave‐buyer and seducer, and all parties had apparently never been in any
                        save their present position. Anne<pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7108-030"/> asked her
                        cousin to one or two of their evenings: he came, seemed to know one or two
                        people slightly, and although professing profound ignorance of art, managed
                        to interest one or two of the æsthetic brotherhood by developing his views
                        on the necessity of extending artistic training to the lower classes.</p>
                    <p>“He isn’t at all a stupid man, that cousin of yours,” remarked little Mrs
                        Spencer; “and I do think he is <emph>so</emph> right in wishing to give poor
                        people a taste of beauty.”</p>
                    <p>“I’m sure <emph>we</emph> are most of us poor people, and don’t always get a
                        taste of anything else, Edith,” cried her father, the veteran painter in
                        tempera, who was a fearful punster.</p>
                    <p>“Oh papa, you know what I mean; and I’m sure art will gain ever so much. It’s
                        only what Mr Ruskin has said over and over again, and Mr Morris is always
                        talking about.”</p>
                    <p>“Any one is free to give the lower classes that taste of beauty, as long as
                            <emph>I</emph> am not required to see or speak to the noble workmen,”
                        said Hamlin. “I hate all that democratic bosh.”</p>
                    <pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7108-031"/>
                    <p>“Oh, I know, Watty; your ancestors kept negroes, and you would like to have
                        negroes yourself,” said Mrs Spencer, hotly.</p>
                    <p>“Heaven forbid! I only ask to be left alone, my dear Edith, especially by
                        reformers.”</p>
                    <p>At any rate, Richard Brown was permitted to show himself sometimes in
                        æsthetic company. But Richard Brown did not avail himself much of the
                        condescending permission to improve his mind; and neither at her own house
                        (for people always spoke of Miss Brown’s house now) nor at the houses of any
                        of her friends would Anne have had much opportunity of seeing her cousin,
                        had he not, by a curious chance, been a frequent visitor at the house of the
                        Leigh girls.</p>
                    <p>Mary Leigh was, as already said, a demi‐semi‐æsthete; she had studied art in
                        an irregular, Irish sort of way, and she had a literary, romantic kind of
                        imagination, which fitted her rather for an illustrator than a painter. She
                        felt the incompleteness of her own endowment, in a gentle, half‐humorous,<pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7108-032"/> half‐sad way; and the incompleteness of
                        her own life—for her ideal of happiness was to travel about, to live in
                        Italy, and this she had cheerfully sacrificed to please her sister, whose
                        only interests in life were school boards, and depauperisation, and (it must
                        be admitted) a mild amount of flirtation with young men of scientific and
                        humanitarian tendencies. Between the sisters there was perfect love, but not
                        perfect understanding; and Mary Leigh, who felt a little lonely, a little
                        shut into herself by her younger sister, who was at once a philosopher and a
                        baby in her eyes, vented her imaginative and artistic cravings in a
                        passionate admiration for Hamlin’s strange and beautiful ward or <foreign xml:lang="fre">fiancée</foreign>, a kind of intellectual fervour which
                        Anne was as remarkable for inspiring as she seemed unable to inspire either
                        ordinary liking or ordinary love: and as Mary Leigh likewise adored Hamlin,
                        and Hamlin in return thought Mary Leigh a nice sort of girl, Anne Brown did
                        what visiting and sight‐seeing and shopping was left to her<pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7108-033"/> almost always in Mary Leigh’s company. Now, if
                        Anne was the idol of the æsthetic Mary, the humanitarian and practical
                        younger sister, who, with the cut‐and‐dry decision of a philosopher of
                        twenty‐two, looked upon æsthetics and æsthetes as somewhat pestilent in
                        nature, had her idol also in a very different person, and this was no other
                        than Richard Brown, to be whose lieutenant in some of his philanthropical
                        and educational schemes was Marjory’s highest ambition. Richard Brown had,
                        ever since meeting his cousin at Mrs Argiropoulo’s in the character of an
                        artistic beauty, made up his mind that Anne was no concern of his, and was
                        luckily disposed of in the æsthetic set; and for some time he almost took a
                        pleasure in making her understand, whenever he met her at the Leighs’ house
                        in Chelsea, that he did not in the least expect <emph>her</emph> to take an
                        interest, or pretend to take an interest, in the plans which he discussed
                        with Marjory Leigh. Anne on the other hand, imbued with Hamlin’s and<pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7108-034"/> Chough’s theory that all attempts at
                        improving the world result merely in failure, and that the only wise
                        occupation of a noble mind is to make for itself a paradise of beautiful
                        thoughts and forms and emotions, was extremely sceptical of her cousin’s and
                        Marjory’s schemes, and once or twice declared her disbelief with perfect
                        openness.</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown was at first annoyed, then amused, then indignant; and then,
                        seeing how completely Anne’s ideas were borrowed from her set, and also how
                        completely unsuitable they were to her downright, serious, and practical
                        nature, he determined, not without vanity playing a part as well as
                        conviction, to “let a little light,” as he expressed it, into her mind.</p>
                    <p>There had been recently founded, by some friends of his, a kind of club where
                        girls of the dressmaker’s apprentice and shopwomen class might spend their
                        leisure moments in reading and meeting each other; which club, besides a
                        library and reading‐room, offered<pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7108-035"/> to its
                        members a certain number of classes or sets of lectures on various subjects,
                        delivered at a nominal price, after work hours.</p>
                    <p>The lecturers or teachers were nearly all young ladies: Marjory Leigh had for
                        some time lectured on sanitary arrangements (this being her especial hobby),
                        and Mary Leigh was going to set up a drawing‐class.</p>
                    <p>Anne Brown, practical by nature and æsthetically sceptical by training, had
                        no very great belief in the famous club; she had been told so often that
                        mankind is too stupid and degraded to be helped, that she had almost got to
                        believe it. But she let herself be taken one evening to a lecture, at what
                        she called Marjory’s college. The lecture was just beginning as they entered
                        the little, white‐washed, bare room up innumerable stairs. Four or five
                        young women, decently dressed, were seated at desks, copy‐books and
                        ink‐stands before them; and a beautiful little girl, who had been pointed
                        out to Anne in æsthetic circles as a rising poetess, was seated opposite<pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7108-036"/> them at the end of a table. The Leighs and
                        Anne sat down silently near the door, and the lecture began. It was on
                        modern history. The pupils listened with the greatest attention, their pens
                        flying on their copy‐books. The lecturer, a small, graceful, extremely frail
                        little creature, began in a somewhat tremulous voice; then gradually, as she
                        got more excited, became more voluble, excited, and absolutely eloquent.</p>
                    <p>“She is too delicate for such work,” whispered Marjory, “but she will do
                        it.”</p>
                    <p>Anne listened. But she did not follow the lecturer’s argument very closely.
                        She thought what these girls were, what the drudgery of their work, the
                        temptations of their leisure, the hopeless narrowness of their horizon; and
                        she thought also, the thought throbbing on almost like dull pain, what it
                        would have been for her, when she also was alone in the world—when she had
                        drudgery on the one hand and temptation on the other—when her whole nature
                        had been parched and withered for want of a few words that should speak
                            of<pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7108-037"/> higher and nobler things,—had she
                        been permitted, once a‐week, to come to such a place, to hear about such
                        subjects, to be spoken to by such an earnest and enthusiastic and exquisite
                        creature as this. At the end of the lecture the girls crowded shyly round
                        the lecturer, some to beg her to explain a point, others to ask for books on
                        the subject, all of them to thank with pathetic earnestness. Then they went
                        away, and the Leigh girls came forward to the lecturer. From where she sat
                        she could not see the new‐comers; and she was astonished, and in a way
                        awe‐stricken, on seeing Anne Brown, the exotic beauty of whom she had heard
                        so much, whose portrait she had seen in so many studios, and to whom she had
                        been introduced almost in fear and trembling, for Anne had a kind of
                        awe‐inspiring fascination for imaginative people. Anne, on the other hand,
                        was silent and depressed, and the little poetess must have made up her mind
                        that this magnificent and sombre creature was as sullen and lethargic and
                        haughty as one of<pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7108-038"/> Michelangelo’s goddesses.
                        But in reality Miss Brown could have laid her head on one of the desks and
                        cried like a child.</p>
                    <p>When, the following day, Mary Leigh came to take her out for a walk, Anne
                        looked as if she had received bad news, or as if she had bad news to
                        communicate. She answered only in monosyllables; until, as they were looking
                        in at a shop window, she suddenly turned to her companion.</p>
                    <p>“Do you think,” she said hesitatingly, “that I might perhaps—teach something
                        at Marjory’s college?”</p>
                    <p>“Teach!” exclaimed Mary Leigh in astonishment; “you teach! Why, what would
                        you teach, Anne dear?”</p>
                    <p>Anne was silent. She sighed. “That’s just what I have been thinking all the
                        morning—I fear—but you see I <emph>do</emph> so want to teach something. You
                        see, that little poet‐girl gives up her time to it, and she was born a lady,
                        and doesn’t know—can’t know—all the good she is doing. While I—”</p>
                    <pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7108-039"/>
                    <p>Mary Leigh squeezed her hand.</p>
                    <p>“We will ask your cousin,” she said.</p>
                    <p>“Oh no, not Dick—don’t mention it to Dick,” answered Anne; “he is sure to
                        make difficulties and laugh at me—he thinks me a useless thing.”</p>
                    <p>“<emph>You</emph> a useless thing!” replied the enthusiastic Irish girl
                        looking at her companion. “Why, then—then all the Titians in the gallery,
                        and the Elgin marbles, and all Keats, and all Shelley, and Beethoven, and
                        Mozart, must be useless also.”</p>
                    <p>Anne sighed. “All those things didn’t make themselves,” she answered. “It’s
                        the artists who were useful and whom we have to thank.”</p>
                    <p>The other Miss Leigh was immensely astonished, and, with her youthful
                        intolerance, rather indignant at Anne’s suggestion.</p>
                    <p>“I think,” said Anne, hesitatingly, “that I could, with a little work, manage
                        medieval literature—at least medieval lyrics.”</p>
                    <p>Marjory shook her head. “There’s too much of that sort of thing already,”
                            she<pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7108-040"/> said. “Every one wants to teach
                        literature. Where’s the use of telling them about a parcel of Provençal and
                        old French and German and Italian people, when they don’t yet know the
                        difference between Voltaire and Molière, and Goethe and Frau von
                        Hillern?”</p>
                    <p>“That’s true,” Anne said sadly.</p>
                    <p>Marjory was rather sorry for her rough practicalness, but at the same time
                        she had a blind impulse to harass an æsthete.</p>
                    <p>“Political economy is what we want most,” she said; and, as the door opened
                        and Richard Brown entered, she went on—</p>
                    <p>“Isn’t it true that political economy is what we want most at the college, Mr
                        Brown?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” answered Richard. “How are you, Miss Leigh?—how are you, Annie? What
                        about it?”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, only that your cousin wants to teach at the college, and I tell her that
                        literature is no use, and that political economy is what we want.”</p>
                    <p>“You want to teach, Annie?” cried Brown,<pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7108-041"/> and
                        his face assumed that look of somewhat brutal contempt hidden under suavity
                        of manner, which Anne hated so much. “You want to teach? How dull æsthetic
                        society must be getting, to be sure!”</p>
                    <p>“I am not dull, Dick,” answered Anne, sternly; “but it struck me that, having
                        been a poor girl without education myself—until” (and she looked her cousin
                        reproachfully in the face) “Mr Hamlin had me taught—I have an obligation to
                        help other girls like what I was, greater than the obligation of people who
                        have always been educated. I daresay there may be nothing that I
                            <emph>can</emph> teach; but there is no reason to laugh at me.”</p>
                    <p>“Laugh at you!” cried Brown. “Oh, not in the least! I was only smiling at the
                        cool way in which you absolve those who are born in fortunate circumstances
                        from the obligation which you yourself feel.”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t think that’s quite true, Dick,” answered Anne, simply. “You think
                        it’s absurd on my part, and I knew you would,<pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7108-042"/> because you think me frivolous and artistic.”</p>
                    <p>“Well,” said Brown, evidently surprised at her manner, and looking
                        searchingly in her pale, strange‐featured face, “what do you think you might
                        teach?”—his voice was much gentler.</p>
                    <p>“At present”—Anne’s voice sank, for she felt the uselessness of her offer—“I
                        can think only of medieval literature” (Brown smiled); “but perhaps, if
                        there were something else, I might get it up.”</p>
                    <p>“I’m sure there won’t be a vacancy for anything except political economy,”
                        interrupted Marjory Leigh, impatiently. “I’m quite positive, from what the
                        secretary told me, all the rest is glutted.”</p>
                    <p>“I fear it is the case,” mused Brown. “There has been a talk of teaching
                        singing,—in which case, perhaps—”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t sing well enough,” said Anne, haughtily. Why was she always having
                        her æstheticism thrust in her face?</p>
                    <pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7108-043"/>
                    <p>“Besides,” added her cousin, “it’s extremely improbable.”</p>
                    <p>They fell to talking of other things. As Brown was leaving, Anne stopped
                        him.</p>
                    <p>“Tell me,” she said, “what are the best books to begin learning political
                        economy?”</p>
                    <p>Brown smiled. “Why? Do you want to teach it?”</p>
                    <p>“Since it is such an important thing,” answered Anne, gravely, “I think I
                        should like to learn it.”</p>
                    <p>“It’s not amusing, Annie.”</p>
                    <p>“It can’t be duller than Minnesingers—and nothing is dull when one is
                        learning it. Can’t you tell me of some books?”</p>
                    <p>Brown looked at her with a puzzled expression. “I have written a primer of it
                        myself,” he said—“I will send it you; and if you get through that, you will
                        find at the end a list of text‐books, some of which I can lend you to take
                        into—”</p>
                    <p>“Thank you, Dick. I shall be much obliged to you.”</p>
                    <pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7108-044"/>
                    <p>“You shall have it this evening. Goodbye, Annie, and <foreign xml:lang="ita">felici studj</foreign>, as you Italians say.” He laughed, and went
                        away.</p>
                    <p>“You’ll find it tough work,” remarked Marjory, shaking her short mane of hair
                        out before the glass; “but, of course, a primer is never <emph>very</emph>
                        difficult.”</p>

                    <p><hi>WHEN</hi> Mrs Macgregor had gone up‐stairs to rest before dinner on their
                        arrival at Wotton Hall, Hamlin took Miss Brown round the huge,
                        deserted‐looking house, which his grandfather had built on returning from
                        Jamaica. It was like an Italian villa, with vaulted rooms, gilded and
                        stuccoed, marble floors, and terraced windows; the furniture was all of the
                        Napoleonic period; nothing could be more dignified or sadder.</p>
                    <p>When Hamlin had shown her the large drawing‐rooms, the library, the room
                        which had been the play‐room when he was a child, he took Anne into the
                        large Palladian hall, and showed her the innumerable portraits of ladies and
                        gentlemen in armour, and ruffs,<pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7108-047"/> and
                        bobwigs, and powder, hanging all round—his ancestors ever since his family
                        had left England in the civil wars.</p>
                    <p>Anne looked at them shyly. They were mostly indifferently painted and
                        vapid—affected, like all old portraits by mediocre painters; but it seemed
                        to her that in most of these gentlemen, with peaked beards on their Vandyck
                        lace, or horse‐hair wigs, or carefully powdered hair tied back in silk bags,
                        she could recognise a resemblance to the man by her side—the same delicate,
                        handsome features, the same fair, almost beardless complexion, the same
                        gentle, melancholy, slightly ironical expression: and never did the real
                        meaning of Hamlin’s marriage with her come clearer before her mind than
                        when, in that silent hall, surrounded by all those portraits of his
                        ancestors, she suddenly saw herself and him reflected in one of the long dim
                        mirrors; she, so tall and strong, so powerful of bone and muscle, with her
                        strange, half‐southern, half‐Jewish, and<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7108-048"/>
                        almost half‐Ethiopian beauty, by the side of that slight, fair, pale,
                        aristocratic man, with features sharp like those of a high‐bred race‐horse,
                        nervous and wistful and dreamy, as if he were tired of his family having
                        lasted so long.</p>
                    <p>“They all married and intermarried for nearly a century,” said Hamlin,
                        “that’s why they’re all so like each other. I often wonder why it didn’t end
                        in insanity—you see it has ended in a poet at last. My mother was the first
                        woman married by a Hamlin for eighty years who was not at least a second
                        cousin,—in those islands there were very few decent people, you see. Don’t
                        they all look dapper and respectable? It appears they were not. That man in
                        the corselet was killed in a duel about another man’s wife. That one in the
                        middle, the boy in the grey dress with the powdered hair, Sir Thomas Hamlin,
                        they used to call the bad Sir Thomas, because he amused himself practising
                        pistol‐shooting on black people, whom he had put all round his yard;<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7108-049"/> he was a very fine gentleman, they say,
                        and would go out only in the evening on account of his complexion. The one
                        who looks like a woman, with the open shirt‐collar and the long hair, was my
                        great‐uncle, Mordaunt Hamlin, who supposed himself to be a poet, somewhere
                        in the first years of this century; he was an opium‐eater, and did some
                        horribly disgraceful things, I don’t exactly know what, and was poisoned,
                        they say, by some low woman, because she was tired of him. My father had his
                        portrait removed; but I used to see it in the lumber‐room when I was a
                        child, and thought him very handsome and eery; and when I came of age, I had
                        it brought down, because I think he’s far better‐looking and more
                        interesting than any of the respectable ones. Then he was a poet also, you
                        see, and Cosmo Chough pretends I’m like him. Do you think so, Miss
                        Brown?”</p>
                    <p>“No,” said Anne, laughing, as she looked at Hamlin, at that noble and
                        delicate face, which seemed to her the noblest and most beautiful<pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7108-050"/> in the world; and yet, when she looked at
                        Mordaunt Hamlin again, with his morbid woman’s face and his effeminate bare
                        throat, she could not help feeling a certain disgust at the thought that
                        perhaps—perhaps— Hamlin <emph>was</emph> just a little like him.</p>
                    <p>“That’s my mother,” said Hamlin, pointing to a faded crayon of a beautiful,
                        gentle, pathetic‐looking woman.</p>
                    <p>“<emph>That</emph> is like you,” cried Anne, delighted. “That is very like
                        you—like your expression. I was wondering where you got your expression from
                        among all your Jamaica ancestors.”</p>
                    <p>“I’m glad you think so. She was a very beautiful woman, and very brave and
                        noble, and not very happy, poor mamma.”</p>
                    <p>“Did you know her?”</p>
                    <p>“Only till I was about twelve; she died young. That is grandpapa; and that is
                        my uncle Arnold,—he died young too—in fact, drank himself to death. Don’t
                        you think he is like Mordaunt Hamlin? That’s papa;<choice>

                        </choice><pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7108-051"/> and Hamlin stopped before the
                        full‐length of a handsome effeminate man.</p>
                    <p>“You wouldn’t think that he was a very violent man, would you?” he said.</p>
                    <p>“No,” answered Anne, looking at that weak, worn, rather blear face, and
                        thinking how her father, too, had been a drunkard; but how different had
                        been the drunkenness of the poor overworked mechanic, so industrious and
                        gentle and high‐spirited when he was sober, from the sort of emasculating
                        vice of Mordaunt and Arnold Hamlin, of Walter Hamlin’s bad‐faced father!</p>
                    <p>“It’s very curious,” pursued Hamlin, with a sort of psychological interest in
                        his own family, “how that Mordaunt, who, after all, was no ancestor of mine,
                        tries everywhere to perpetuate himself. There’s unfortunately no portrait of
                        my great‐grandfather, or perhaps we might understand it; but perhaps it came
                        from the mother. It’s curious I have never felt any inclination to drink—I
                        mean, however moderately; but I can’t take<pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7108-052"/>
                        any wine at all—it makes me drunk at once.”</p>
                    <p>“I never have seen you take any wine, by the way,” said Anne.</p>
                    <p>“I tried opium once; but Chough made me give it up. It’s sad to be denied any
                        sort of unreal pleasures, don’t you think? That’s my brother and I when we
                        were boys.”</p>
                    <p>Anne stopped to look at the picture.</p>
                    <p>It was very well painted, though a trifle old‐fashioned. The two boys were
                        represented in shooting‐jackets, with guns and dogs. The shorter, slighter,
                        and paler boy was evidently Walter Hamlin; the other was more robust,
                        boyish, and ordinary‐looking.</p>
                    <p>“Your brother died when he was a child, did he not?”</p>
                    <p>“Oh no,” answered Hamlin, quickly. “Poor Arnold—was very fond of shooting—I
                        hated it; but papa had the picture painted on his account; he was the
                        favourite at first, being younger.”</p>
                    <p>It seemed to Anne that Hamlin was going<pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7108-053"/> to
                        say something different from what he had said. What had become of Arnold
                        Hamlin? Mrs Macgregor’s allusions to him, who had evidently been her
                        favourite nephew, always seemed to point to a melancholy end.</p>
                    <p>“It’s curious,” said Hamlin, after a moment. “Arnold looked so jolly and
                        strong when he was a child; and yet, later, he got such a look of our
                        grand‐uncle Mordaunt.”</p>
                    <p>“I think you have your grand‐uncle on the brain,” said Anne, trying to break
                        through Hamlin’s strange mood.</p>
                    <p>They left the hall, and went to the window of the large drawing‐room, and
                        looked out on the reddening beeches and the grass, permitted to grow high
                        and thick, in the yellow sunlight.</p>
                    <p>“I shall sell this place most likely soon,” said Hamlin; “I’ve already had
                        some offers for it. It’s too large, and pompous, and characterless for me. I
                        should like a real old country‐house, two or three centuries old, with
                        flower‐gardens and panelled rooms,—not this plaster and stucco and romantic
                            gardening.<pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7108-054"/> Besides, I hate this
                        place—have hated it ever since I was a child.”</p>
                    <p>Anne did not answer.</p>
                    <p>“I hate this place,” went on Hamlin, leaning on the window‐sill by Anne’s
                        side, “and that is the reason why I have brought you here. Before saying
                        farewell to it for good and all, I wish to save it from being a mere hateful
                        recollection in my life. I wish to be able to think of it in connection with
                        you;” and he looked up at Anne, who was leaning against the tall French
                        window.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t know,” went on Hamlin, again looking out at the vaporous yellow
                        sunset horizon— “I don’t know what are destined to be the relations between
                        our lives. You have seen too little of the world as yet to be able to know
                        yourself and me; and I am more and more decided to abide by my original plan
                        of giving ourselves time to understand each other, and to understand whether
                        we are made for one another. . . .”</p>
                    <p>He looked at Anne; she had turned an ashy‐white as she listened; she had
                            thought<pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7108-055"/> that Hamlin loved her, and now
                        . . . He noticed it, and understood, but pretended not to understand; he
                        enjoyed playing upon a living soul, all the more upon a soul like this one,
                        slow to respond to his touch, with low and long‐sustained vibrations, like
                        those of some deep‐toned instrument.</p>
                    <p>“Don’t take what I say in bad part,” he went on, conscious to himself that he
                        was speaking the truth, and at the same time that he was acting, telling it
                        at a moment and in a manner which made it untruthful; “and don’t think that
                        I mean anything horrid against you or against myself, when I say that you
                        don’t yet know me, and will not know me, perhaps, for some time. You see me
                        through your own nature, your own enthusiasms, your own aspirations; you
                        think I am strong where I am weak, and pure where I am impure.”</p>
                    <p>Anne shook her head.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t think so.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin smiled sadly.</p>
                    <p>“But I do. It’s very sad to think that one<pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7108-056"/>
                        must lose so much that is worth most in life, all one’s illusions, before
                        one can approach the reality of even one’s best friends,—that even one’s
                        best friends can be seen as they really are only when we have got
                        disillusioned and disappointed, is it not?”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin had often said things like these in the letters which he used to write
                        to her, and had hinted, much more clearly, at weaknesses and basenesses
                        which she would some day recognise in him.</p>
                    <p>It could not occur to Anne, whose character was so completely of a piece,
                        that there was any untruthfulness in this mode of speaking, any more than
                        she could believe that Hamlin could be correct in thus speaking of himself.
                        The sort of shimmer, as of the two tints in a shot stuff, of reality and
                        unreality, of genuine and affected feeling, of moods which came
                        spontaneously and of other moods, noticed, treasured up, reproduced in
                        himself,—which existed in Hamlin, would be perfectly unintelligible to
                        Anne.</p>
                    <pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7108-057"/>
                    <p>“I daresay,” she answered gravely, “that you have faults, in which, at
                        present, I cannot believe; but those faults are not the ones which you
                        imagine. When a man knows himself to have a fault, he ceases to have it—he
                        cures it.”</p>
                    <p>A sensation of a new experience passed through Hamlin’s mind as Anne said
                        this: it seemed so strange, pathetic, grand, to him—who knew himself to be
                        for ever mixing up the unrealities of his art with the realities of his
                        life, to be continually experimenting upon himself the moods of his
                        poetry—that any one should seriously think thus, should not know that when a
                        man recognises in himself a fault, he may, so far from eradicating, cherish
                        it stealthily.</p>
                    <p>“You have asked me not to be angry with you for telling me that I am
                        inexperienced and cannot yet know my own mind,” said Anne; “don’t be angry
                        and don’t laugh at me if I tell you that I think you don’t always know
                        yours. I have often observed how <choice>

                        </choice> you are about yourself, how apt to fancy morbid things; I suppose
                        it is because poets are always turned inwards, and because you have not
                        perhaps been very happy sometimes, and because”—and she looked at him half
                        laughing, half with the tears in her eyes—“you are very good. I daresay I
                        don’t know you thoroughly yet, but I know you—I know I know you—better
                        sometimes than you do; because you fancy all sorts of horrid mysterious
                        flaws in your character wherever there is a little inequality; and I know
                        how good and noble you are, and how you are always thinking that you must be
                        wicked.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin did not answer. He was deeply touched, touched all the more because he
                        knew how little she guessed at the self‐conscious unreality of so much of
                        him.</p>
                    <p>“You are very comforting,” he said sadly, then went on more cheerfully:
                        “well, what I wanted to say, when we began to discuss which of us knew the
                        other better, is this,—that whatever we may be destined to be to<pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7108-059"/> one another in future—and this I dare not decide
                        even in surmise—you will always have been to me, in these years that I have
                        known you, in the past and present, an infinite source of happiness and
                        good; a something which to have possessed, as I possess your friendship,
                        will always remain, even should all the reality come to an end and only the
                        recollection remain, the most precious thing in my life.” He had taken her
                        hand, and playing with her strong shapely fingers, so much stronger and less
                        delicate, though not less shapely than his own, looked with a kind of
                        solemnity into her face. Anne could not answer, for if she did, she knew she
                        must cry; she felt the tears, as it were, all through her nature; she seemed
                        to see, she knew not why, but as a solemn certainty, that things could never
                        go any further, that Hamlin was prophesying the inevitable future: and yet,
                        in the midst of this quite inexplicable, unreasonable sense of loss and
                        resignation, there was a deep happiness which she had never<pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7108-060"/> before felt, the happiness of the present; a
                        something new to Anne, though all other lovers have felt the happiness of
                        possession of one another, even at the moment of loss.</p>
                    <p>“It is getting chilly,” said Hamlin, and shut the window. “You look very
                        pale, Miss Brown; had you not better put on some warmer dress this
                        evening?”</p>
                    <p>His voice seemed like the curtain dropping after a scene, or the chord at the
                        end of a duet. It was a return to reality and prose.</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps I had better, and I ought to go and see after your aunt; good‐bye
                        for the present.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin strolled out into the terrace, and lit a cigarette; the past and
                        present, his real and unreal self, Anne, his brother and father, his
                        great‐uncle Mordaunt—all went cloudily through his brain. He was very happy.
                        Love to him was not what it was to other men, not what he had tried it
                        himself in former years. It was romance, but romance not of ladders and
                        hairbreadth escapes, but<pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7108-061"/> of psychical
                        conditions, of spiritual sensations. He had written fleshly poetry and
                        passionate poetry, but no one could be less fleshly or less passionate than
                        Hamlin: the ‘Vita Nuova’—if it could be made modern, and the parts altered
                        and reversed—unreal reality of love, had been his ideal, and he had got
                        it.</p>
                    <p>They had many conversations like this one. Hamlin never so much as kissed
                        Anne’s hand, never told her that he loved her, spoke merely of himself, of
                        her, of the future and the past, of what she would one day know, of what he
                        would one day feel; and Anne listened seriously, trying to cure him of his
                        despondency and morbidness, trying to persuade him of his own worth and of
                        her clear‐sightedness, while never a suspicion crossed her simple stern mind
                        that all this earnest talk, which was so tragic and still so delightful, was
                        the thing which she scornfully connected with whispers and kisses and
                        nonsense,—in one word, love‐making.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                    <p><hi>THEY</hi> remained about a fortnight completely solitary in the large
                        house. Hamlin was finishing a poem and correcting the proofs of his next
                        volume. Anne was continuing her usual literary studies, but now with the
                        addition of some books and pamphlets on political economy, which had been
                        incredulously lent her by Richard Brown. The two young people had never seen
                        so much of one another, and they were, Hamlin in his dreamy manner, Anne in
                        her serious, practical way, very happy. Mrs Macgregor went on reading her
                        old‐fashioned freethinking books, and giving out cynical remarks, which her
                        amiable and utterly gullible character deprived of all weight. She was the
                        elder and considerably<pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7108-063"/> older sister of
                        Hamlin’s mother, and had lived in the house for many years as a widow. She
                        had been twice married, each time for love, and each time to men who, if one
                        might trust her nephew, had been immediately reduced by her into the most
                        devoted and timid slaves; yet she always spoke of marriage as if every
                        misfortune of her existence was due to it. Imbued with the pseudo‐scientific
                        and somewhat anti‐social philosophy of early deism (though herself a rigid
                        stickler for decorum), Mrs Macgregor had a way of talking of love and
                        marriage which for some time had made poor Anne profoundly miserable: men
                        and women, averred the old lady, were, whatever they might pretend to the
                        contrary, entirely at the mercy of their animal passions,—to suppose that
                        any one successfully resisted them was sheer folly; marry people must, but
                        marriage was the most unfortunate of all necessities, the beginning of all
                        unhappiness, the end of all independence, self‐respect, and pleasure in
                        life; it was the long waking up from a <choice>
                            <orig>dis‐<pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7108-064"/> graceful</orig>
                            <reg>disgraceful</reg>
                        </choice> delusion; yet this disgraceful delusion, this drunken condition
                        called love, was (always according to Mrs Macgregor) the one beautiful and
                        poetical thing in the world.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t believe that all people are like that, Aunt Claudia,” Anne would
                        often exclaim indignantly. “I don’t believe that all people marry from
                        unworthy passion, just to wake up and find its unworthiness. I am sure that
                        if love were such a vile thing, and marriage such a mistake, every man or
                        woman with any self‐respect and self‐restraint would refuse both.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, my dear child,” Mrs Macgregor would answer with a smile, “wait till you
                        are a little older and see what a disgusting thing life is.”</p>
                    <p>“If it is,” answered Anne, feeling quite nauseated and terrified, and at the
                        same time resolute in herself—“if it is, Aunt Claudia, it is because men and
                        women are mostly such wretched, weak, silly, base, puling creatures.”</p>
                    <p>Then, when she saw Hamlin, and thought of<pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7108-065"/>
                        the noble way in which he had acted towards her, of the calm and clear love
                        and gratitude which she felt towards him,—when she thought of the things
                        which they talked about together, of the desire to become worthier with
                        which his love had inspired her, of the greater trust in his own worthiness
                        which she hoped her love was instilling into him,—nay, when she looked at
                        that thoughtful, delicate, almost diaphanous face of his, Anne’s anger
                        towards the old lady would turn into mere pity; she would merely, in her own
                        certainty of worthiness, smile at what she now considered as the mere empty
                        talk of a disgusting school of thought, or, at best, as the lamentable
                        generalisations from a horribly exceptional family, such as she understood,
                        vaguely, that of Hamlin’s father to have been. And, for the rest, Anne
                        believed that though people were very ridiculous, and affected, and mean in
                        little matters (she was thinking of the Spencers, and the Saunders, and so
                        many other of her æsthetic friends), and although they might also, like<pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7108-066"/> Cosmo Chough, make the mistake of thinking
                        indecent things interesting and dramatic, the vast majority of mankind and
                        womankind was really very pure, and generous, and loving at bottom. So,
                        after a time, she listened to Mrs Macgregor’s remarks with only a little
                        habitual and instinctive annoyance, but without any kind of serious belief
                        in them. And when Aunt Claudia would sometimes allude to the bad lives which
                        had been led in this particular house—to the vices (taking them quite as
                        ordinary matters) of Hamlin’s grandfather and father and uncles, of the
                        neglect and violence which her sister, Hamlin’s mother, had suffered from,
                        hinting that, if one only knew, the self‐same things were happening in every
                        other family on earth,—whenever there came any such allusions, Anne would
                        carefully, as it were, close up these loopholes into a past, in which she
                        scarcely believed and from which she shrank: the world seemed to her as
                        good, and healthy, and strong, and easy to understand as herself. But while
                        she did thus,<pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7108-067"/> Anne was so gentle and
                        sympathising to Mrs Macgregor, that the old lady was never hurt by her
                        contradictions; indeed she would sometimes say that, were she not persuaded
                        that no law of nature can have any real exceptions, she would almost believe
                        that Anne was quite different from any other woman that ever was.</p>
                    <p>It seemed somehow, here all alone in this ancestral home of Hamlin’s, as if
                        the fate which Hamlin had refused to forestall was working itself happily
                        out; and as if, tacitly, the poet‐painter and the girl whom he had educated
                        were becoming affianced to each other. None of the outward ceremony was
                        broken through; he was always Mr Hamlin, and she Miss Brown, and there was
                        never an allusion permitted to any more intimate relations. But it seemed
                        perfectly natural that he and she should go walks together; that Aunt
                        Claudia should leave them alone at breakfast and luncheon; and that, when
                        the old lady had retired to her room, they should remain,<pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7108-068"/> with brotherly and sisterly ease, though not
                        brotherly and sisterly free‐and‐easiness, talking together of an evening.
                        And as they talked, their plans seemed constantly to merge; that they should
                        be separated never occurred to either (except when Hamlin was in one of his
                        tragic moods), although not a word passed to settle their future together.
                        The long courtship, the long enjoyment of a ceremonious and unfettered love,
                        was what Hamlin had wished for, and what he had; to a fixed future, a family
                        and family affections, he was not the man to look forward; it would have to
                        come, and he did not feel any dislike for it, but he gave it no thought. As
                        to Anne, she had never made up her mind that she had a right to be Hamlin’s
                        wife; to have thought so for one moment would have seemed to her grasping
                        ingratitude; and she was too happy in the present to think about the future.
                        The thing to be thought of was to become worthy of him, that was all.</p>

                    <p><hi>BY</hi> the middle of the summer a perfect colony from æsthetic London
                        had settled itself, to the amazed terror of the vicar and his parishioners,
                        in Wotton Hall and the inn of the adjacent village. The Spencers came, with
                        a perfect shipload of babies, and accompanied by Mrs Spencer’s father and
                        mother; Cosmo Chough came, bringing scarcely any luggage except MS. poems
                        and old music; Thaddy O’Reilly came, and half‐a‐dozen young poets and
                        painters, to name whom would be perfectly superfluous, and who were all the
                        humble worshippers of Walter Hamlin. All these people had pictures to paint,
                        poems to compose, articles to write; but the exciting question for the whole
                        household was the approaching publication of Hamlin’s new book.</p>
                    <pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7108-070"/>
                    <p>Hamlin’s acquaintance with Anne Brown had not been without a decided
                        influence on his art. He had written a number of sonnets about her ever
                        since the moment of their first meeting, recording various moods, real and
                        fictitious, in connection with her, and of which he had sent or read her the
                        greater number. Perhaps he would have written much the same sort of thing
                        about any other woman; but Anne had influenced him at once more directly and
                        more indirectly. The æsthetic school of poetry, of which Hamlin and Chough
                        were the most brilliant exponents of the younger generation, was evidently
                        running to seed. It was beginning to be obvious, to every one who was not an
                        æsthete, that the reign of the mysterious evil passions, of the
                        half‐antique, half‐medieval ladies of saturnine beauty and bloodthirsty
                        voluptuousness of the demigods and heroes treated like the figures in a
                        piece of tapestry, must be coming to a close; and that a return to nature
                        must be preparing. Anne had felt it, and had vaguely determined<pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7108-071"/> that the man who was to revolutionise poetry was
                        Hamlin. Indeed, who else could it be? The elder poets were safe in their
                        ruts; the majority of the younger ones who had already come forward were
                        mere imitators and caricaturists, not excepting the great Chough himself.
                        Hamlin alone was a man of genius; he alone was capable of turning over a new
                        leaf; and one or two new departures, attempts at a new way of describing
                        things, if not actually an attempt at describing new things, persuaded Anne
                        that the change was beginning. She did not like telling him that she
                        perceived it coming; for she thought that Hamlin might, did he perceive it,
                        consider it as an apostasy from his original school, and draw back. But she
                        encouraged him by showing a marked preference for the pieces which savoured
                        of this new style; and she even suggested to him to write a tale, in which
                        he should substitute, for the conventional background copied by æsthetic
                        poetry from the borders of missals, the pictures of old masters and of their
                        French gods, Gautier<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7108-072"/> and Baudelaire, the
                        scenery of his own home, the wide commons, the beech‐woods on the downs, the
                        solemn horizons of the fenny country which spread from Wotton to the sea. He
                        had written it, and read it to her during that fortnight of solitude; and
                        Anne’s heart had beat at the thought of the change which was to be wrought
                        by Hamlin’s new book—of the unknown youths hitherto fumbling vainly for a
                        new style, who were to recognise in Hamlin the leader of a new school, the
                        prophet of a new art. When the colony of London æsthetes arrived at Wotton,
                        the new poem was solemnly read to them. They were all seated in the
                        old‐fashioned library, the rows and rows of old novels and books of standard
                        literature, the busts of ancient philosophers looking down upon them,—a
                        quaint little assembly of ladies in peacock‐blue and dull sage and Japanese
                        dragoned and medieval brocaded gowns, with slashed sleeves and limp tails—of
                        men got up to look like Frenchmen or Germans, or Renaissance creatures, in
                        wondrous <choice>

                        </choice>, colonred almost like the bindings of their own books. They
                        listened with considerable attention, and obvious impatience to interrupt.
                        The first who did so was Mrs Spencer.</p>
                    <p>“Why, Walter!” she exclaimed indignantly, “what possesses you? are you crazy?
                        Why, you are going in for realism; do you know that?”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t see any particular realism, Edith,” answered Hamlin, testily.</p>
                    <p>“Come, now, it isn’t Zola, my dear,” said her father, a good‐natured man, who
                        never carried his belief in himself to the length which it was carried to by
                        his family.</p>
                    <p>“No, it isn’t Zola,” cried Miss Spencer; “but it’s worse than Zola. . .
                        .”</p>
                    <p>(“It’s just the decentest thing I’ve heard for many a long year,” murmured
                        the old painter.)</p>
                    <p>“It’s worse than Zola, because it’s poetry and not prose, because it’s
                        English poetry, because it’s poetry by Walter Hamlin, who has hitherto been
                        an apostle of beauty, and is now basely turning apostate and going over to
                        ugliness.”</p>
                    <p>There was a slight laugh at Mrs Spencer’s<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7108-074"/>
                        vehemence, in which Hamlin alone did not join.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t think there’s anything actually ugly in it,” put in Chough, blandly.
                        “Hamlin could never write anything ugly. But it is certain that there’s a
                        want of idealism in it, a want of that exotic perfume which constitutes the
                        essence of poetry. I think it’s an unfortunately chosen subject. . . .”</p>
                    <p>“I think it’ s perfectly disgusting,” gobbled out Dennistoun, the little
                        rickety poet, who had to be carried up and down stairs, and who wrote, while
                        slowly sinking inch by inch into the grave, about carrying off lovely girls,
                        and throttling them in the fierceness of his love. “Did you notice about the
                        heroine washing the children? I call that beastly, beastly. And then, I
                        don’t know how any man can write a poem about people who are in love and get
                        married.”</p>
                    <p>This seemed an unanswerable piece of criticism. Anne alone leaned across the
                        table; she was very indignant. “I think,” she<pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7108-075"/> said, “that there is much more poetry in people who love each other
                        respectably, and respectably get married, than in all the nasty situations
                        which modern poets write about.”</p>
                    <p>Cosmo Chough looked at Dennistoun, and Dennistoun looked at Mrs Spencer’s
                        father.</p>
                    <p>“My dear young lady,” cried the old painter in his broad Scotch, “d’ye ever
                        know any of these gentlemen write a poem about people who did any single
                        respectable thing?”</p>
                    <p>“I wonder you can talk like that, papa,” silenced his daughter, whose zeal
                        for him and his school included timely snubbings for himself.</p>
                    <p>“Well, my dear, I privately think with Miss Brown that there’s nothing more
                        poetic than a gude, bonnie lass of a wife, and I don’t wonder a bit at
                        Walter being of that opinion. But then, of course, I’m not a poet.”</p>
                    <p>“It’s that washing of the children which troubles me,” reflected Chough, “and
                        their being married. Don’t you think, now, Hamlin, that you might just alter
                        a little, and make it appear that they <emph>weren’t</emph> married?”</p>
                    <pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7108-076"/>
                    <p>“Only put a husband of the lady in the distance,” suggested O’Reilly,
                        laughing.</p>
                    <p>“Thank you,” said Hamlin, affecting to laugh, “your suggestion is most happy,
                        and most characteristic. You are always full of original ideas—all of you,”
                        and he looked bitterly round. Chough felt the rebuke and was silent. But
                        Dennistoun, who was gasping, propped up in his chair, was furious.</p>
                    <p>“It’s not a question of an alteration here or there,” he gobbled out; “it’s
                        the whole tone of the poem which is pestilent. It’s Wordsworth pure and
                        simple, that’s what it is.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin rolled up his MS. He was very white. The others he did not mind, but
                        this little rickety Dennistoun, whose poems were the most limited and the
                        most hopelessly morbid of the whole set, annoyed him; for in Dennistoun, for
                        all his limitations and repetitions, Hamlin recognised the most genuine poet
                        of his circle, his most real rival. Those words, “It’s Wordsworth, that’s
                        what it is,” were like<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7108-077"/> a blow. He could
                        have knocked down Dennistoun, had he not been a cripple.</p>
                    <p>The conversation was changed; and soon the first dinner‐bell dispersed the
                        company. When Anne came down she heard some one stirring in the study next
                        door. She went in. Hamlin was seated before the table, his head on his
                        hands; the MS., all crumpled up, lay in front of him.</p>
                    <p>Anne came silently to his side. Her heart was bursting with indignation.</p>
                    <p>“What’s the matter?” asked Hamlin, crossly.</p>
                    <p>“Nothing. I only came—because I wanted to see you—because I wanted to tell
                        you how I despise those people and their disgusting, unmanly school of
                        poetry—how I hate their stupid criticism,—how completely I believe in you
                        and in your poem.”</p>
                    <p>Anne had spoken with vehemence and almost anger. She took one of his hands,
                        which was dog’s‐earing the MS.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, why,” she asked, “why do you read<pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7108-078"/> them
                        what you write? Don’t you know them sufficiently to know what they will
                        say?”</p>
                    <p>“I never thought—” and Hamlin stopped. “I never thought that that fellow
                        Dennistoun would ever dare to speak like that about a poem of mine.” His
                        tone was angry and tearful, like that of a punished child.</p>
                    <p>“Nor did I. I never thought any one would dare to speak like that. But what
                        does it matter—what can the words of such a man matter to you?”</p>
                    <p>He did not answer.</p>
                    <p>“Surely,” went on Anne, “you can’t mind what they say? You believe in your
                        poem, as I believe in it?”</p>
                    <p>It seemed so impossible to her how any one could not believe in that poem,
                        which seemed to her so strong, and noble, and beautiful.</p>
                    <p>“I know you believe in it,” answered Hamlin, brusquely; “you made me write
                        it—so of course you must—”</p>
                    <p>“And—and—are you sorry to have written it?”</p>
                    <pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7108-079"/>
                    <p>“I don’t know; I can’t judge. There’s O’Reilly outside.”</p>
                    <p>“The disconsolate poet being consoled by his beautiful <foreign xml:lang="fre">fiancée</foreign> for having written about people who
                        were united in legitimate wedlock,” whispered O’Reilly to Mrs Spencer as
                        they entered the room.</p>
                    <p>“Well, Hamlin, old fellow, do you repent you of that sinful marriage between
                        your hero and heroine?” asked O’Reilly.</p>
                    <p>“I repent me of nothing at all, except of having read my poem to a parcel of
                        damned meretricious rhymesters,” answered Hamlin, angrily.</p>
                    <p>“Walter!” cried Mrs Spencer, “how can you talk like that!”</p>
                    <p>But, despite this bravado, Anne felt, and her spirit sank within her, that
                        Hamlin had been disgusted with his poem. He was rather cantankerous
                        throughout dinner; and Anne, watching him, felt a strange mixture of
                        indignation—towards his critics for their criticism, and towards Hamlin for
                        minding it.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                    <p><hi>THE</hi> time has come for him to break with the old school, thought
                        Anne; consoling herself for a certain childish petulance, perhaps not quite
                        new to her, in Hamlin’s manner.</p>
                    <p>But Anne proved mistaken. Whether the critics became less rabid on the
                        following day, or whether Hamlin was suddenly smitten with the truth of
                        their criticism, she could not say. He was very snappish at first towards
                        Chough, and absolutely refused to speak to Dennistoun for nearly twenty‐four
                        hours. Chough, who loved Hamlin like the apple of his eye, would not,
                        however, be spurned; he followed Hamlin about, he soothed him, he flattered
                        him, he assured him that he was much the greatest poet of his generation;
                        but he repeated, <choice>
                            <orig>al‐<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7108-081"/> most</orig>
                            <reg>almost</reg>
                        </choice> with tears in his eyes, Dennistoun’s criticism.</p>
                    <p>“Such a poem will <emph>never, never</emph> do,” he cried; “it is impossible,
                        intolerable, and it will just put some fellow like Dennistoun into your
                        place.”</p>
                    <p>“Thank you for your advice, Chough,” answered Hamlin, angrily; “I think I
                        told you before that I didn’t want it.”</p>
                    <p>Anne did not revive the subject of the unlucky poem. It was useless provoking
                        quarrels between Hamlin and his friends; quarrels in which she was forced to
                        own to herself that he showed himself too easily mortified and put out of
                        temper. If he had been taught to mistrust their judgment, if he had been
                        alienated from their school by their absurd criticism, why, so much the
                        better. This business drew Anne’s attention to the poetry of the school; she
                        re‐read a number of poems by Chough, Dennistoun, and several gods, demigods,
                        and heroes of the movement. Whether it was that she had read<pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7108-082"/> them fragmentarily before, or that she had not
                        understood their full meaning, or whether her attention was now called to
                        their bad points rather than to their good ones, she scarcely knew; but it
                        seemed to her that she had never before comprehended this style of poetry:
                        its beauty had ceased to please her, it seemed to her false, emasculate,
                        diseased. Hamlin alone had not gone to its worst lengths; he had sinned, but
                        comparatively little. He was evidently intended for something better. And
                        Anne thought with pride of that “Ballad of the Fens” which they had all
                        fallen upon, and which was to be the signal for a new era in poetry. Soon it
                        would be out; and she the only person to have appreciated it. It seemed to
                        Anne that at last, in her humble way, she might be beginning to repay the
                        debt of gratitude which she owed Hamlin (not that she wished that the debt
                        should ever be less, God knows, or dreamed that it could be); but at last
                        Hamlin might reap some advantage from his generosity. He<pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7108-083"/> had stooped to make her, to turn the Perrys’
                        servant into a lady; in her turn, perhaps she, the woman of the lower
                        classes, might encourage the delicately nurtured poet to attempt things
                        bolder, simpler, and more healthy than he had done before.</p>
                    <p>The proof‐sheets of the new volume began to come in. Anne had read nearly all
                        its contents at one time or other, yet Hamlin, in his grave, ceremoniously
                        adoring way, handed on the proofs to her. One day a fresh bundle came by
                        post. After breakfast, Hamlin took Anne aside.</p>
                    <p>“I want you to read these sonnets,” he said. “I don’t think you have read
                        them all. There are rather more than I care to print in this volume, so I
                        should like you to select those which you think the best or the least bad:
                        divide them into two packets, and tell me which you prefer.”</p>
                    <p>Anne was quite taken aback for joy, and at the same time for fear.</p>
                    <p>“Don’t say that,” she said; “I could never,<pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7108-084"/>
                        never take the responsibility of deciding about your poems. Let me read
                        them, and let me tell you what I like best, but don’t ask me to choose. What
                        am I, that I should decide in such matters?”</p>
                    <p>“You are the person whom I trust and respect, and—will you let me say
                        so?—whom I love most in all the world,” said Hamlin, solemnly. “For whom
                        should my poetry be written except for you? Whom else should I care to
                        please? Are you not the best and worthiest thing in my life, and is it not
                        my highest ambition to do anything worthy of you?”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin had never spoken so passionately and earnestly before.</p>
                    <p>Anne did not answer, but she squeezed his hand, and the gesture, and the look
                        accompanying it, meant “I love you.”</p>
                    <p>“Listen,” said Hamlin, detaining her as she was leaving—“I want to say one
                        word more. These sonnets are not merely my verses; they are myself—and many
                        of them, you will see, are about you. Perhaps you<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7108-085"/> would rather that some of these were not
                        published; perhaps your permitting them to be published might mean more than
                        you should wish. Tell me your opinion frankly, and put aside everything that
                        you don’t like.”</p>
                    <p>“I will,” answered Anne. “What you wish me to do, I must do.”</p>
                    <p>She went up into her room, shut the door, and seating herself at the table,
                        unrolled the little bundle of proof‐sheets. But at first she could not read,
                        or could read only the titles—her heart beat so, and the blood boomed so in
                        her temples. That he should love her so much, believe in her so much—that it
                        should really be he, just he and she, and not some one else; it seemed too
                        strange to be true. She slowly began to read the sonnets. Some of them she
                        knew already; others were expansions in verse of things which Hamlin had
                        said or written to her; many were about herself, passionate, with a sort of
                        delicate, subdued, respectful passion, played, like some exquisite
                        instrument, in various keys and rhythms of subdued pain or<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7108-086"/> gladness. She felt so proud and glad, and at the
                        same time so moved and saddened, that she almost cried over them. There were
                        a lot of other sonnets, descriptive of places and of moods. Some of these
                        she did not at all relish. They were not fleshly nor exactly improper; but
                        they contained allusions which Anne could not help following, allusions
                        which she did not quite understand, but which she did not like. She felt
                        half ashamed of herself, wondering whether all the impure poetry which she
                        had lately been reading, whether her prejudice against the school to which
                        these decidedly belonged, might not be making her imagine things which were
                        not meant; and Anne blushed at the thought—blushed at her knowing so many
                        things, having learned so many things, in her half education as an Italian
                        servant, in her culture as an æsthetic personage, which perhaps other girls
                        of her age would not dream of. It was probably only her own morbid fancy.
                        But then she came upon a set of sonnets—<pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7108-087"/> no
                        fewer than twelve connected together by similarity of title—which put an end
                        to her doubts. She felt giddy and sick as she read them; mysterious and
                        mystical hankerings, mysterious half‐longing repentance, and half‐repentant
                        longings after untold shameful things. Anne pushed aside the proof‐sheets,
                        and leaned her head on her hands. She seemed to be smothering for want of
                        air; she went to the window, and leaned against its rails. It was raining—a
                        steady, clear fine rain. She looked at it mechanically as it filled the air
                        like a thin veil, and crevassed the sand outside with yellow trickles of
                        water. She did not for one instant believe that Hamlin had ever felt the
                        things about which he was writing; but he had written about them. She knew,
                        from an unerring instinct, as well as from her own deep love, that Hamlin
                        was as pure a man as could be found; had he not been towards her—was he not,
                        at that very moment—the very personification of chivalrous and spiritual
                        lovingness? Then she<pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7108-088"/> remembered the
                        allusions which, without understanding them, used to frighten her in his
                        letters—the allusions to vague evil which beckoned to him, which surrounded
                        him; and she remembered also his constant references in conversation to his
                        being unlike what she imagined, to his baseness and unworthiness. Two years
                        earlier she would have been seized with an agonising terror; a week before
                        she might have been overcome with pitying admiration at his self‐tormenting
                        moral purity, taking umbrage at every thought of evil which passed across
                        and seemed to soil his mind. But somehow, now, she did neither. She did not
                        for one second believe that Hamlin was in any way a bad man. She repeated to
                        herself that he was morbidly introspective, self‐scrutinising, morbidly
                        imaginative; but she could not realise that these hateful sonnets had been
                        written in any great agony of imagined self‐debasement; they were so
                        artistic, so evidently written with enjoyment, so self‐conscious; they were
                        so clearly not the<pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7108-089"/> doubts of a troubled
                        mind, but the work of a poet—and, what was much worse, so clearly the work
                        of a poet of a definite school, of the school of Chough and Dennistoun and
                        all the others, whom she was beginning to loathe. Anne looked at them over
                        and over again. There was no reality in them; mere revolting
                            <emph>pose</emph>. Gradually her mind settled about them. They were
                        doubtless things written long ago, when, without knowing what it all meant,
                        he had been carried away by the wave of imitation of one or two shameless or
                        foolish writers. He had alluded to sonnets which he had expected her to
                        dislike, he had insisted so on a certain number being put aside; if he had
                        made her think that it was the sonnets about herself which provoked his
                        doubts, that came from a sort of shame, an unwillingness to point out to her
                        what she might perhaps overlook: it was not quite straightforward, but
                        everybody, Anne had learned by this time, did not do right in a quite
                        straightforward way. The only thing which perplexed her was, why he<pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7108-090"/> had submitted these poems to her at all?
                        Why had he not torn them up? why shown them to her? A little she could not
                        help, as a woman, resenting his having done so at all. But perhaps he had
                        done so to show her the difference between what he had been and what he was
                        going to be,—perhaps—perhaps he had got a little callous, living among poets
                        of this school. Anyhow, they were things of the past, and Anne did not
                        distress herself any longer about them, so foreign did they seem to Hamlin,
                        so impossible was it to bring them into connection with the thought of him.
                        She put the proofs into her pocket, and waited for an opportunity of giving
                        them back. Before dinner, when the guests were safe out of the way, she
                        called Hamlin into the library.</p>
                    <p>“Here are the proofs,” she said, laying them on the table.</p>
                    <p>“Have you read them already?” cried Hamlin; “how sweet of you! Now tell me
                        what you think about them.”</p>
                    <p>He looked so cheerful, so utterly <choice>
                            <orig>uncon‐<pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7108-091"/> scious</orig>
                            <reg>unconscious</reg>
                        </choice> of the possibility of Anne’s having anything to say disagreeable
                        to himself and herself, that she began to feel nervous.</p>
                    <p>“I think they are most of them very beautiful,” she answered slowly—“indeed,
                        quite some of the best things you have ever done—and especially those about
                        me; I am very grateful to you for them. But”—she resumed, after a moment’s
                        silence—“there are some which I dislike extremely, and which are utterly
                        unworthy of you. I have put them into the smaller roll by themselves.” She
                        spoke rapidly, decidedly, but when she had done she felt that she was
                        crimson.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin seemed quite speechless for astonishment. He quickly unrolled the
                        smaller parcel, and glanced at its contents. A look of surprised ill‐humour
                        crossed his face.</p>
                    <p>“I am quite astonished at your choice,” he said with affected coolness; “for
                        these are the very sonnets which Chough and Dennistoun and all my other
                        friends picked out as among my best.”</p>
                    <pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7108-092"/>
                    <p>So he had already provided himself with a stock of criticisms.</p>
                    <p>“I am no judge of their technical merits,” answered Anne, trying to feel as
                        if she had expected this news. “It seemed to me that they were very
                        excellent in workmanship, and there is beautiful imagery in them. But I
                        think the subject and tone of them horrible.” she spoke resolutely and
                        unflinchingly, because she saw Hamlin’s eyes fixed incredulously on her.
                        “You asked me to give you my frank opinion; and even had you not asked me, I
                        should have felt bound to tell you that I think those sonnets ought not to
                        be published. Perhaps you think it strange of me to speak so openly; but, of
                        course, I understand what those sonnets allude to, and, of course, so will
                        every grown‐up reader.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin bit his moustache.</p>
                    <p>“There is not a single word to which any one can take objection in these
                        sonnets,” and he turned over the proofs.</p>
                    <p>“What do the words matter? It is the<pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7108-093"/>
                        meaning. I think,” and Anne vainly tried to soften down her expressions,—“I
                        think that those sonnets are things you should be ashamed of.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin’s eyes flashed, but he kept his temper.</p>
                    <p>“Everything is legitimate for the sake of an artistic effect,” he said,
                        echoing the worn‐out aphorism of his school.</p>
                    <p>“Even to do a disgraceful thing?”</p>
                    <p>“I can see nothing disgraceful in a man attempting to describe what has
                        passed through his mind.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin spoke sullenly and doggedly.</p>
                    <p>“You have shifted your position,” cried Anne. “You intimated just now that a
                        man may pretend to anything for the sake of an artistic effect. And now you
                        are trying to make me believe that you really have felt and thought those
                        horrible things. It is of no use. You have not—”</p>
                    <p>“How do you know?” exclaimed Hamlin, angrily. “Do you think I tell you
                        everything that I have ever done, or thought, or felt?”</p>
                    <pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7108-094"/>
                    <p>Anne was silent for a moment: that he should prefer to make her believe in
                        his own baseness! It was horrible, loathsome, and, at the same time,
                        pitiable and childish.</p>
                    <p>“I know you have not,” she repeated, “because I know you to be a gentleman.
                        And I know that all that is affectation—school affectation—learned from
                        creatures like Dennistoun and Chough; they have all done it, or something of
                        the sort, and you have learned what comes naturally to their dirty minds.
                        Oh, Mr Hamlin, do not commit this abomination—this baseness of pretending to
                        shameful things which you have not felt or thought; do not be so mean, so
                        base, so lying, as to slander yourself for the sake of an artistic effect.”
                        Anne had seized his arm; he was shaken by her unexpected vehemence and
                        passion; he had never thought that Anne could become so passionate about
                        anything; he looked on, taken by surprise, not knowing what to think.</p>
                    <p>“Do not slander yourself,” repeated Anne—“do not blacken your real self,
                        which does not<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7108-095"/> belong to yourself alone,
                        which belongs also to your friends, to your honour, which belongs in part to
                        me. Do not lie to me about yourself!”</p>
                    <p>“As you choose,” answered Hamlin; “perhaps you are right; though, heaven
                        knows, I thought myself, when writing those sonnets, but too bitterly in
                        earnest.”</p>
                    <p>Anne’s look—a look of incredulous contempt—smote him like a rod.</p>
                    <p>“I suppose I am apt to be morbid,” he said, sadly; “that is the wretchedness
                        of my life, that I never know where the truth about myself really lies—it
                        seems to me that I ought to speak out, and yet . . .”</p>
                    <p>“And yet it is mere nonsense.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin smiled a forced smile.</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps it is. Since you are determined, I suppose it must be.”</p>
                    <p>“You won’t publish those sonnets?” asked Anne, anxiously.</p>
                    <p>“I will not, since they offend you so much. But it is curious, that of all
                        the people to<pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7108-096"/> whom I have shown them, you
                        are the only one who has taken the slightest exception to them.”</p>
                    <p>For a moment Hamlin had been overcome, had been delighted by this sudden
                        burst of impetuosity, by this passionate belief in him and vindication of
                        himself. But now, as he again glanced at the sonnets, he was once more
                        annoyed and resentful.</p>
                    <p>“Such things must be judged from a purely artistic standpoint,” he said with
                        some irritation.</p>
                    <p>“I am willing to judge art from an artistic standpoint; but I cannot judge
                        from an artistic standpoint an honourable man trying to defame himself.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin sighed.</p>
                    <p>“Well, after all, I bade you select, and the principal thing is that you
                        should be satisfied. But it <emph>is</emph> a pity, because those were just
                        the best sonnets in the book; and the book will be very small without the
                        ‘Ballad of the Fens.’”</p>
                    <p>“The ‘Ballad of the Fens’?—aren’t you going to print that? What do you
                        mean?”</p>
                    <pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7108-097"/>
                    <p>Could Hamlin be merely worrying her, to vent his annoyance at the loss of the
                        sonnets?</p>
                    <p>“The ‘Ballad of the Fens’ has been torn up,” answered Hamlin, with a kind of
                        dogged satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Mr Hamlin! How could you—the finest thing you have ever written.”</p>
                    <p>The ballad torn up!</p>
                    <p>“I know you thought it good, and so did I myself. But, on reflection, I saw
                        that my friends were right, and that such a thing would not do.”</p>
                    <p>He spoke sharply, brutally, as if to bring home to Anne the unreliableness of
                        her judgment: she had induced him to write it; she had praised it; and she
                        wanted him to tear up those sonnets.</p>
                    <p>“It is a bad plan to keep things about which one is doubtful,” he went on;
                        “so I tore it up. I think it was wiser; don’t you?”</p>
                    <p>“No,” said Anne, in a husky voice which burst out in a way that almost
                        frightened him; “no, no—it was . . .” but she said no more.</p>

                    <p><hi>ONE</hi> morning Hamlin received two unexpected letters at breakfast.
                        From his looks, which he was at all times quite unable to control, it was
                        clear that one of them brought good news, while the other must be about some
                        disagreeable matter.</p>
                    <p>“Edmund Lewis is coming the day after to‐morrow,” announced Hamlin to his
                        aunt, to Anne, and to his guests.</p>
                    <p>There was a chorus of exclamations of surprise, sprinkled with pleasure.</p>
                    <p>“Who is Edmund Lewis?” asked Anne. “He is an old friend of mine, a charming
                        fellow whom I have not seen for some years. Some of the drawings in the
                        drawing‐room at Hammersmith are by him.”</p>
                    <pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7108-099"/>
                    <p>Anne remembered the name, and the strange, beautiful, cruel, mysterious,
                        out‐of‐drawing heads in crayon, which had curiously impressed her the first
                        morning after her arrival in England, rose before her eyes; since then she
                        had seen so many similar things, had got to understand so completely that
                        mysterious, beautiful faces, with combed‐out hair, big weird eyes, and cruel
                        lips, were so much school property, that she had become quite indifferent to
                        them.</p>
                    <p>“I thought you told me that something strange had happened to him—that he had
                        left England for good,” remarked Anne.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, it was nothing particularly strange,” interrupted little O’Reilly—“only
                        a German lady whom he met one day, blond, fat, thirty‐five, who was nothing
                        but a soul—you know the sort of thing—with a husband who was a great deal
                        besides a soul (a charming man, for the rest, and quite wildly in love with
                        the <choice>
                            <corr>Gnädige</corr>

                        </choice> Frau). The excess of soul having induced acute neuralgia in the
                            lady,<pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7108-100"/> poor Teddy Lewis, who is a
                        tremendous magnetiser, was called in to soothe her agonies, during which
                        process the lady discovered that the soul‐sorrow and consequent neuralgia
                        from which she suffered was due to the soullessness of her husband, and that
                        only the brotherly affection of Ted could cure her. The difficulty was the
                        husband, who loved the lady fervently, and she him, but not in a way which
                        should satisfy her soul. Hence struggles, agonies, &amp;c.—you’ve read
                        it all in the ‘Wahlverwandschaften’—finally ended by the husband being
                        implored to sacrifice himself to the spiritual exigencies of his adored
                        wife, which absolutely required that he should divorce her and let her marry
                        Lewis. That’s all.”</p>
                    <p>“How can you talk in such a flippant way, Mr O’Reilly?” cried Mrs Spencer.
                        “You have a way of making the most serious things seem ridiculous. Poor Mrs
                        Lewis! she’s dead now; you needn’t make fun of her.”</p>
                    <p>“Poor Mrs Lewis!” laughed O’Reilly;<pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7108-101"/> “well,
                        you know you wouldn’t receive her, Mrs Spencer, when she first came to
                        England.”</p>
                    <p>“I thought her a designing woman then; I didn’t know all the
                        circumstances.”</p>
                    <p>“Come now, Edith,” interrupted her father, in his broad Scotch; “I
                            <emph>think</emph> the less ye knew those circumstances the better it
                        was for all concerned.”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t see that at all, papa. I don’t see why a woman’s happiness should be
                        sacrificed,” and Mrs Spencer, who was the most devoted of wives and mothers,
                        tossed her head rebelliously. “I don’t see why the world should insist that
                        a woman is to be satisfied with a husband who is good to her and her
                        children. After all, she has a soul, and that requires response.”</p>
                    <p>“Would you behave as Mrs Lewis did?” asked O’Reilly, “If—well—let me see—Mr
                        Spencer were suddenly to develop an overpowering belief in the Royal Academy
                        and in Zola?”</p>
                    <pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7108-102"/>
                    <p>“Papa would never have let me marry a man who <emph>could</emph> ever develop
                        such beliefs.”</p>
                    <p>At this perfectly solemn answer there was a general laugh; even poor Mr
                        Spencer, who was the most timid of æsthetical persons, joining.</p>
                    <p>“I think it was rather hard on poor Ted Lewis,” remarked Hamlin, “to become
                        necessary to the soul of a lady whether he liked it or no.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Lewis liked it well enough, be sure of that,” answered Chough,
                        bitterly.</p>
                    <p>“Don’t you think it was rather hard upon the husband,” suggested Anne, “since
                        he really cared for his wife? Fancy being abandoned like that, and his
                        children left without a mother!”</p>
                    <p>“He was at liberty to marry again,” replied Mrs Spencer sharply, still
                        thinking of what she would do if by any chance Mr Spencer were to suddenly
                        disbelieve in her father and his school.</p>
                    <p>“What would you have had Lewis, or rather<pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7108-103"/>
                        the poor Baroness, do, Miss Brown?” asked O’Reilly.</p>
                    <p>“Why, I would have them never dream of each other; but if they had been so
                        foolish, be ashamed as soon as possible, and each go his and her way, and
                        attend to his and her proper concerns.”</p>
                    <p>Dennistoun, who had sat silent at the other end of the table, propped up on
                        his chair, suddenly stretched out his long neck, and gobbled out—</p>
                    <p>“Love permits no man or woman to resist: it is imperious, irresistible,
                        dragging us along to happiness, or misery, or shame, whether we will or not.
                        Love is the extinction of the reason, the extinction of the will, or rather
                        the merging of the whole individuality in one mysterious desire. Those who
                        can talk of resistance have never experienced love. Woe to them! their hour
                        is coming!”—and he tried to fix his weak eyes on Anne.</p>
                    <p>“Well,” she answered quickly, “I hope I may never make such a disgusting fool
                        of <choice>
                            <orig>my‐<pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7108-104"/> self</orig>
                            <reg>myself</reg>
                        </choice> as you describe, Mr Dennistoun; but as I think that not everybody
                        is liable to go mad, so also I think that not everybody is liable to falling
                        in love in your sense of the word.”</p>
                    <p>O’Reilly leaned over the back of her chair.</p>
                    <p>“It happens only to those who want to write about it, Miss Brown,” he
                        whispered.</p>
                    <p>“Anyhow,” remarked Hamlin, “Lewis is a charming fellow, and I am sure you
                        will appreciate him, Miss Brown. He is, moreover, the most backbitten man in
                        creation,” and Hamlin glanced round the table; “but you must never believe
                        any harm of him.”</p>
                    <p>Perhaps, thought Anne, Edmund Lewis was disliked by this set for the same
                        reasons which, she could not help understanding, were beginning to make her
                        vaguely unpopular. Still, she did not like the story of his marriage, she
                        did not like the recollection of his morbidly beautiful drawings.</p>
                    <p>“It’s good news about Lewis,” said Hamlin to her after breakfast; “but
                            unfortunately<pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7108-105"/> there’s been rather a
                        bothering letter also. Did I ever mention a cousin of mine, the daughter of
                        papa’s sister and of a horrible Russian creature called Polozoff? She was
                        brought up with us as a child, and is connected with a great many painful
                        circumstances. I have completely lost sight of her since she was about
                        fifteen, and now I suddenly get a letter from her telling me that her
                        husband is dead, and that she is coming to England. I rather loathe the idea
                        of her, and if you knew the part she played in this house fifteen years ago,
                        you could understand it. But the worst is that Aunt Claudia perfectly
                        abhorred her—I will tell you the horrible, prosaic, tragic story some
                        day—and that I perfectly dread having to break the news to her. I do hate a
                        scene so! There she is; I suppose I’d better tell her.”</p>
                    <p>Mrs Macgregor was walking slowly up and down the gravel walk before the
                        house.</p>
                    <p>“Do come and keep me in countenance.<pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7108-106"/> It
                        really is no fault of mine, but I know my aunt will be furious.”</p>
                    <p>“What’s the matter?” cried Mrs Macgregor suspiciously, as if expecting to be
                        told something disagreeable.</p>
                    <p>“I wanted to tell you, Aunt Claudia,” said Hamlin, “that I had a letter this
                        morning.”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, I know, from your dear Lewis,” interrupted Mrs Macgregor. “What’s that
                        to me?”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t mean that one. I had a letter from—guess from whom?” and Hamlin
                        tried to smile—“from Cousin Sacha.”</p>
                    <p>Mrs Macgregor recoiled as if she had trodden on a toad.</p>
                    <p>“From whom?”</p>
                    <p>“From Cousin Sacha. Sacha Polozoff—Madame Elaguine, I suppose I ought to call
                        her.”</p>
                    <p>For a moment there was a dead silence. The old lady’s face, usually so
                        vacant, was lit up into a terrific energy of anger.</p>
                    <p>“ What business has <emph>she</emph> to write to <emph>you</emph>?”</p>
                    <p>“Well, really, aunt, I don’t see why she shouldn’t,” answered Hamlin. “After
                            all,<pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7108-107"/> we are cousins, and we have never
                        openly quarrelled.</p>
                    <p>”My aunt,“ he explained, turning to Anne, ”has got a tremendous aversion—a
                        prejudice—towards this one and only cousin of mine. She disliked her father,
                        very reasonably, and I think she has let her dislike descend to the second
                        generation rather unreasonably.“</p>
                    <p>”Unreasonably!“ exclaimed Mrs Macgregor; ”<emph>you</emph> know it was not
                        unreasonable, Walter—you know what that Cousin Sacha of yours was in this
                        house.“</p>
                    <p>”I know nothing of the sort,“ cried Hamlin, angrily. ”I know that Sacha lived
                        in this house as a child; I know she left it as a child; I know we all hated
                        her and hers, and that perhaps they deserved it; but I know that we have no
                        right to hate a woman of whom we know nothing, because she happened to have
                        been a badly brought up child, years ago.</p>
                    <p>“At all events,” went on Hamlin, “I insist upon her being properly treated as
                        a lady, and a relation.”</p>
                    <pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7108-108"/>
                    <p>“Properly treated!” almost foamed out his aunt. “Do you mean to say that she
                        is coming <emph>here</emph>?”</p>
                    <p>“Not here; but to London. Her husband is dead; and she writes to me that she
                        thinks she had better send her boy to an English school; and as the only
                        person in England upon whom she has a claim—”</p>
                    <p>“A pretty claim!” interrupted Mrs Macgregor.</p>
                    <p>“As her first cousin, she has written to me for information and
                        assistance.”</p>
                    <p>“And you are going to give it her, Walter?”</p>
                    <p>“Of course I am. And I hope, Aunt Claudia, that you will remember that I
                        won’t be disgraced towards a lady who has done us no harm. She will be in
                        London, most likely, when we return at the beginning of winter.”</p>
                    <p>Anne had heard many allusions to this Cousin Sacha, and they belonged to that
                        class of cynical hints which always made her indignant with Mrs Macgregor.
                        She instinctively took part with this unknown woman,<pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7108-109"/> and she admired Hamlin’s decision and generosity.
                        Why did he not always act like this?</p>
                    <p>“That child—that Sacha,” said Mrs Macgregor, when Hamlin had left them, “was
                        the evil genius of his house. She was sent as if to embody all the bad
                        tendencies of the family. It was a miserable house at best, my
                        brother‐in‐law’s, for he was a weak, vicious, violent man. But just when
                        this wretched child was brought to us my sister had died, Mr Hamlin was very
                        much shaken and repentant for the life he had led her, and I really believe
                        that he had made up his mind to live decently for the sake of his children.
                        The two boys were growing up, and there seemed some chance of things going
                        quietly and happily. Then Mr Hamlin thought fit to invite home his sister,
                        who was a widow; she had married a horrible Russian, a sort of indecent
                        madman, with every possible vice under the sun. She was an odious woman
                        herself, the regular slave‐driving type of the Hamlins. Oh, you can’t judge
                        of them from<pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7108-110"/> Walter; he’s like my sister,
                        not like them. Well, she was violent, and overbearing, and tyrannical, and
                        lazy, and hysterical, like a regular Jamaica woman. She was enough in the
                        house; but then she had this child of hers, this Sacha, with her—a wretched,
                        neglected creature, brought up by French servants, who were her father’s
                        mistresses, and literally with no more idea of right and wrong than any of
                        the little heathens whom they pick out of gutters in the East End and send
                        to reformatories.”</p>
                    <p>“Poor child!” said Anne. She shuddered at this glimpse into Hamlin’s early
                        life; it had a horrible attraction for her, and yet she felt that she would
                        far rather know nothing about it. All this filth seemed to cling to her mind
                        and soil it. “How horrible for her!”</p>
                    <p>“She was about twelve when she came to us,” went on Mrs Macgregor
                        meditatively, “and you couldn’t believe that such a child could exist in
                        Christendom. She could no more spell the simplest word than I can speak<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7108-111"/> Arabic; she spoke an awful jargon of
                        English and French and Russian and German, and she used to talk about
                        things, and repeat stories which she had heard from her nurses, or her
                        father, or her father’s friends—I don’t know whom—that were enough to make
                        your hair stand on end. Mr Hamlin was in perfect despair; because, although
                        he was a vicious sort of man himself, and quite did my poor sister to death
                        with his bad conduct, he was awfully strict about all his kith and kin, and
                        kept the boys as tight as if he had been a Puritan. What we all had to go
                        through, you have no idea. At first I was quite ashamed to let any governess
                        see such a little heathen as that child was, and we had to pay the
                        governesses double wages to keep them on. Then, every time that they tried
                        to break Sacha off some one of her disgusting ways, her mother, who was
                        always moaning and groaning with imaginary maladies on her sofa, and no more
                        thought of her daughter than of the man in the moon, would go into
                            hysterics<pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7108-112"/> and throw things in their
                        face, and have them turned away, and keep Sacha for a day in her room,
                        kissing her and giving her sweets. Well, we thought we were little by little
                        getting the better of her; and then, thank goodness, Madame Polozoff, that
                        was Mr Hamlin’s sister, died. Sacha learned a few things, and began to
                        behave a little more like a Christian child; but it was only on the surface.
                        She was utterly and thoroughly corrupt. When the boys returned from school
                        (Arnold was sixteen, and Walter seventeen), the mischief began. That
                        wretched Sacha fell madly in love with Walter, and began running after him;
                        but Walter perfectly loathed the sight of her: he was always the cold,
                        moral, irreproachable sort of creature that he is. Then she went after
                        Arnold. Arnold was much the livelier of the two: he was a dear, warm‐
                        hearted, simple sort of boy, a perfect scapegrace, always in pickles, but we
                        only liked him the better. But that wretched Sacha (he didn’t care a rap
                        about her either,<pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7108-113"/> for she was a horrid,
                        lying, sickly, stunted little thing), in order to curry favour with him, put
                        him up to all sorts of mischief, which I suppose she had learned from her
                        precious father and his servants. What was poor Arnold to know? The nasty
                        little fiend used to get out of bed and unlock the house‐door for him, so
                        that he might go in and out at night and get into scrapes with the village
                        girls, and drink at the pot‐house; and she used to steal the wine and the
                        brandy out of the cupboards for him, and teach him all sorts of
                        ungentlemanly, knavish, lying ways; I believe she used even to give him
                        money out of her savings, just for him to go to the pot‐house. If ever a boy
                        was ruined by a woman, poor Arnold was ruined by that miserable Sacha. Then,
                        in return for her assistance and her lies and her money, he had to pretend
                        to like her, to kiss her, and call her his darling little cousin, and
                        promise to marry her, whom he abominated. Meanwhile Walter went dreaming on
                        as he always<pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7108-114"/> has, avoiding Sacha like the
                        plague, and not perceiving any of the pretty doings of his brother; and Mr
                        Hamlin, who thought that his house, just because it was his house, must be
                        the palace of virtue, and his son, because he was his son, must be the most
                        obedient and austere boy in the world, took to liking Sacha and her pretty,
                        foreign little ways, and to think her quite a nice little girl, just the
                        wife for one of his sons. Then one day (I suppose Sacha thought that poor
                        Arnold did not kiss her and <emph>darling little Sacha</emph> her enough, or
                        got jealous or something) they had a great row, and Arnold called her a
                        liar, and said that if she were not a girl he would thrash her well. So
                        Sacha rushed off sobbing to Mr Hamlin, and told him that Arnold had called
                        her a liar, and had threatened to beat her; and Mr Hamlin called Arnold, and
                        struck him in the face till his nose bled, and called him a coward and a
                        brute, and swore he would cut him off with a shilling. Then it all came out
                        about Arnold’s escapades,<pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7108-115"/> his nights at
                        the pot‐house, and so forth; and of course his father said that all he said
                        about Sacha’s putting him up to it was a pack of lies, and finally it ended
                        with Mr Hamlin behaving in such a way that poor Arnold ran away to America.
                        Then we had no news of him for about six months, and Mr Hamlin wanted to
                        take Walter into his good graces, although he had never cared for him, and
                        Sacha tried to make up to Walter. But Walter also ran away to his uncle,
                        because he said he would not stay unless Arnold was recalled, or at least
                        money were sent to him. So Mr Hamlin had to give in and send for Arnold; but
                        meanwhile he had quarrelled with Sacha, and packed her off to her Russian
                        relatives, who sent her to some German deaconesses on the Rhine—a nice child
                        to bring up! Walter returned, and began to prepare for the university; then
                        Arnold was got back from America; but he had only got into worse and worse
                        ways—he was always drunk, and finally his mind began to give<pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7108-116"/> way. Poor Arnold! he was much, much nicer than
                        Walter—such a bright, good‐humoured, manly fellow—and now . . .”</p>
                    <p>“Now?” repeated Anne in astonishment; she had listened without saying a word
                        to this horrible page of family history. “Now? Do you mean that Mr Hamlin’s
                        brother is alive?”</p>
                    <p>Mrs Macgregor looked at her with strange wide eyes. “Of course he is. We say
                        he is dead; or if not dead, mad. Well, he might as soon be either, poor boy.
                        He wanders about with a servant. Walter allows him some money. We never talk
                        of him. Ah!” cried Mrs Macgregor, and it was a kind of suppressed cry of
                        pain—“and that it is all, all owing to Sacha Polozoff; and she has the
                        insolence to write to Walter!”</p>
                    <p>Anne did not know what to say.</p>
                    <p>“But,” she could not help saying after a minute, for it seemed to her as if
                        the whole story were so unjust, so one‐sided, as if there were so much too
                        much laid at the door of<pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7108-117"/> the unhappy,
                        neglected, corrupt child—so much too little pity or indignation shown at her
                        having been thus neglected and corrupted,—“but, Aunt Claudia—is it fair to
                        put it all down to Sacha? After all, Arnold was sixteen, he was a man, he
                        had been decently brought up—and she, she was an ignorant child, brought up
                        as you say without idea of right or wrong. Don’t you think—oh, don’t you
                        think, auntie dear, that it was mainly the fault of old Mr Hamlin, and his
                        bad example, and his closing his eyes to his boy’s behaviour?” It seemed to
                        her so frightful that a girl, a child, a victim, just because she was a
                        victim, should have such a weight of guilt thrown upon her.</p>
                    <p>“She was a woman, and he was a man,” said Mrs Macgregor fiercely, her love
                        for her lost nephew, and her strange theories of sexual influences mixing
                        grotesquely and tragically—“and a woman can always do what she will with a
                        man; a woman can always, unless she be as weak as my poor<pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7108-118"/> sister, ruin or save a Hamlin, ever since
                        Walter’s great‐uncle Mordaunt went to the bad, even worse than poor
                        Arnold.”</p>
                    <p>“Some of them,” she said after a moment, “are good, and some are bad: my
                        brother‐in‐law was bad—Arnold was good, and Walter is good; but they are all
                        as weak as water, these Hamlins—weak in goodness or badness, every one of
                        them.”</p>
                    <p>Anne sighed. And as she walked through the big, stately rooms of Wotton
                        House, she thought of the horrible scenes which had happened in there; of
                        the waste of life by violence and vice and neglect which they had witnessed;
                        especially of that wretched, vicious child, held so terribly responsible for
                        the folly and wickedness of others. And the sense of the terrible power of
                        circumstances, of the degradation into which others may lead one, or out of
                        which others may raise one, which had been silently growing in her as she
                        watched the world in her tragic way, came over her with a terrifying
                            rush;<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7108-119"/> and she felt, half in anxiety at
                        scarcely escaped danger, half in joy at safety, a tumult of gratitude when
                        she remembered how Walter Hamlin had raised her up, led her out of the way
                        of all temptation and evil contact, and left her safe and strong as she knew
                        herself to be.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                    <p>As the summer changed into autumn, the guests at Wotton Hall were gradually
                        renewed. Chough remained, and at Anne’s particular desire sent for his two
                        little girls, sad, strange, Cockney creatures, to whom the large house, the
                        garden, the country walks and country sights, were as things of another
                        world. But the Spencers, Dennistoun, and O’Reilly departed; and in their
                        place arrived the two Leigh girls and Edmund Lewis. The last‐named gentleman
                        did not by any means strike Anne as a fascinating being. He was a stumpy,
                        high‐shouldered, thick‐set little man, always very slackly dressed, with
                        small, rather handsome features, and a profusion of curly reddish hair and
                        beard, which made his face<pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7108-121"/> look even more
                        like unbaked dough than it might otherwise have done. Some people considered
                        him very handsome, and it was obvious that he himself felt as if he were
                        tall; for he stumped and slouched in and out of rooms with his hands in his
                        pockets, and dropped on to chairs and sofas with the heavy importance of
                        gait of a Hercules. Nothing could be more comic than the contrast between
                        this lumbering and solemn redhaired dwarf and Cosmo Chough, black, fierce,
                        alert, courteous, and grandiloquent. Lewis was silent; but when he spoke he
                        fixed his handsome eyes searchingly upon one, and either trailed his voice
                        along with slow emphasis, or answered in monosyllables, which left in you an
                        uncomfortable feeling of having made some inappropriate or impertinent
                        remark. He had, moreover, lips of the colour of the very best sealing‐wax; a
                        peculiarity which, while decidedly adding to the pictorial value of a
                        red‐haired man, has a something quite particularly repulsive to certain
                        people, among<pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7108-122"/> whom Anne Brown must be
                        counted. However, she tried to like Mr Lewis. In some respects he was a more
                        genuine personality than Chough, or Dennistoun, or almost any other of
                        Hamlin’s æsthetic friends. He did not make himself up—manner, appearance,
                        ideas, or words—to look like anything which he was not, or at all events
                        which he did not thoroughly believe himself to be; and he was, moreover,
                        much more in the way of will and definite tendencies, and felt himself
                        (however mistakenly) to be much more in the way of power, character, and
                        importance, than any other man whom Anne had ever come across, except her
                        cousin Richard, between whom and Edmund Lewis there existed, despite a
                        thousand differences, a certain resemblance. And perhaps it was exactly this
                        resemblance to Richard Brown,—a man whom Anne did not exactly like, nay, who
                        even occasionally repelled her a little, but of whose power and truthfulness
                        and generosity Anne could not doubt,—perhaps it was this resemblance, <choice>
                            <orig>how‐<pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7108-123"/> ever</orig>
                            <reg>however</reg>
                        </choice> vague it might be, which made Anne for some time believe that
                        Edmund Lewis, little as he pleased her, might be a remarkable sort of man,
                        and treat Chough’s insinuations against him as merely another instance of
                        that childish unreasonableness of likings and dislikings, which, together
                        with vanity and weakness of will, she had got to associate with a poetic
                        endowment. Over Hamlin, at all events, Edmund Lewis had an undeniable
                        influence; an influence which he himself avowedly attributed to his magnetic
                        powers, which he would exert, or imagine that he exerted, sitting lazily
                        opposite his friends or victims, staring vaguely at them and speaking in his
                        slow, important voice. He was a painter, in an irregular sort of way,
                        himself, and took much more interest in Hamlin’s art than in his poetry; so
                        that Hamlin, who was sick of versifying for the moment, had a fit of
                        painting once more, and spent hours locked up in his studio with Lewis,
                        while poor Cosmo Chough was more and more thrown upon Anne and her
                            friends.<pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7108-124"/> But the girls had got to
                        understand Chough, and the fund of kindness and self‐sacrificing gentleness
                        which was hidden beneath the little man’s poetical thin‐skinnedness and the
                        queer poetical veneer of mystic wickedness which he himself did not
                        understand. He could not by any possibility be broken of his tendency to
                        talk overmuch about Messalina, Lucretia Borgia, and La Belle Heaulmière; but
                        by this time it was quite obvious that he had not the smallest experience of
                        ladies of any such character, still less the faintest thought of giving
                        offence by his allusions to them. To Anne he was utterly devoted: he was
                        fascinated by her beauty, afraid of its tragic earnestness, afraid of her
                        downright, quiet manner, afraid of her silent contemptuousness, of her
                        uncompromising censoriousness; but if ever a person appreciated Anne’s
                        kindness, her energy, her imperious desire of helping others, it was Chough.
                        Anne had often spoken to him about the neglected education of his little
                        girls; not reproachfully, for she knew but too well on<pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7108-125"/> what it depended, but trying to stir him up to
                        resist the sort of fatality which seemed to hang over his family concerns.
                        And now she insisted on taking the children’s education into her own hands,
                        until Chough should be able to afford sending them to a proper school.
                        Perhaps the thought of that neglected, unconsciously corrupted, terribly
                        responsible little heathen girl, who had done so much mischief in Wotton
                        Hall fifteen years before, had something to do with Anne’s energetic
                        behaviour towards the little Choughs—to whom, every morning regularly, she
                        gave a two hours’ lesson in grammar and writing and history, as complete as
                        if she had been a schoolmistress and they her pupils; until their father,
                        astonished at their unexpected development of human faculties, took it in
                        his head to turn them into first‐rate musicians, and actually got up at six
                        in the morning to teach them the piano, while Hamlin and Lewis were still
                        asleep.</p>
                    <p>Marjory Leigh, who had considered Anne<pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7108-126"/> in
                        the light of an irresponsible but decidedly objectionable æsthetic villain
                        on her departure from London, looked on in puzzled amazement. She could not
                        understand how any one so beautiful, so versed in useless literature and
                        useless art, any one whom her foolish elder sister foolishly adored, could
                        be anxious and able to make herself of use in the world. And even Mary
                        Leigh, in her gentle, ironical way, was astonished at Anne’s new vocation,
                        and adored her all the more enthusiastically for it. Mrs Macgregor hinted,
                        in her affectionate cynical manner, that Anne was mistaking for a desire to
                        be useful to Chough’s children the mere imperious necessity of caring for
                        some one, which was the vicarious form of love; and prophesied archly that,
                        once married, Anne would soon be satisfied with uselessness. Anne smiled
                        contemptuously at Mrs Macgregor’s theories. Yet she was as unaware as was
                        Mrs Macgregor herself, that there was indeed an imperious necessity in her
                        nature—a necessity more personal, more selfish, and more<pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7108-127"/> terrible than her mere desire to be of use. In
                        these four months Anne had gradually, and hitherto unconsciously, ceased to
                        love Hamlin as she had formerly loved him. Like many of the most powerful
                        and passionate natures, Anne had a fatal tendency to love ideally and love
                        the ideal; not so much to invest with unreal qualities the object of her
                        passion, but to conceive a passion for an impersonal creation of her own, an
                        amalgamation of her own ardent and confused aspirations after an unknown
                        excellence; and then to identify the object of this strange intellectual and
                        moral passion with the first real person who struck her as excellent and
                        noble and beautiful, or who appealed strongly to her sympathies and her
                        gratitude. Of love in the ordinary sense, such a nature is wellnigh
                        incapable; and the devotion due to real imperfect creatures, pity and
                        sympathy with weakness, the devotion due to a sense of duty, although it may
                        be intense and tender in such people, comes only on later, when the first<pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7108-128"/> splendid idol has been shattered, and
                        whatever passion there is must be given, in humbleness or sorrow, to the
                        unsatisfying realities of this world. With such a nature and such
                        tendencies, Anne had been met, when young, ignorant, and friendless, by an
                        indistinct yet real personality—by Hamlin, who had done for her more than
                        any other man had ever done for a woman; and in this vaguely seen Hamlin,
                        known at first only as a servant knows the brilliant guest of the house, a
                        model the painter to whom she is sitting—and then known at a distance, in
                        letters which were the unreal efflorescence of a poet’s mind,—in this
                        vaguely seen Hamlin, to whom she owed her new life, and who was surrounded
                        by all the beautiful things and ideas which that new life represented, Anne
                        Brown had incarnated the ideal of good and beauty towards which her simple,
                        self‐unconscious, energetic soul so strenuously aspired. Such a love as this
                        must be transformed into something less exalted, or must die out
                        unsatisfied, whatever the person who<pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7108-129"/> feels
                        it or the person with whom it is connected: the real, however excellent, can
                        never satisfy the craving after the ideal; a living individual can never
                        quiet desires which have no individual object, which are mere dumb and
                        violent activities of a too powerful soul. But Anne was not the kind of
                        woman in whom simpler and less exacting instincts, in whom ordinary love,
                        can gradually supplant such an ideal passion; and what was worse, Hamlin was
                        not the man who could substitute for an impossible and unapproachable
                        creature of the imagination, a less perfect, but more appealing, more
                        attaching, more lovable creature of reality.</p>
                    <p>No man that ever breathed could have satisfied cravings which were in reality
                        not after a man, but after a higher life, a more complete activity, a nobler
                        aim; but Hamlin fell short not merely of Anne’s ideal, but also, in many
                        things, even of the reality of Anne herself, and of all she could understand
                        and sympathise with. The ecstatic devotion<pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7108-130"/>
                        had speedily given way in her to a more sober kind of admiration and
                        affection; but now, little by little, that also was being invaded,
                        transformed piecemeal here and there, by doubt, contempt, and disgust.
                        Anne’s eyes had gradually opened to the fact that Hamlin was vain,
                        thin‐skinned, professionally jealous, and afraid of the judgment, as he was
                        avid of the praise, of his own inferiors; and that, in the negative line, he
                        was without strong likings, enthusiasms, or aspirations; and the negative
                        qualities affected her more than the positive ones: to her the coldness of
                        Hamlin’s sympathies was more painful than the weakness of his nature.
                        Vaguely and gradually these things had dawned upon Anne; and she could no
                        more deny their existence than she could persuade herself that a grey
                        English autumn day was brilliant as an Italian summer morning. But of late
                        things had happened, like that incident of the suppressed “Ballad of the
                        Fens,” and of the self‐slandering sonnets which Hamlin looked upon with
                            such<pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7108-131"/> complacency, which had given her
                        glimpses into something worse than she could well believe in, worse than she
                        had the heart to look into. These she cast behind her, thinking of them as
                        little as possible, trying to consider them as hallucinations, or at all
                        events, gross exaggerations of her own: she must have misunderstood; such
                        things could not be. She tried to settle her love of Hamlin on a real and
                        more solid basis. She fully admitted to herself that Hamlin had
                        weaknesses,—the weaknesses which she remarked in so many of the men around
                        him,—weaknesses going together with the fine qualities of the poet’s
                        nature,—weaknesses which, Anne was beginning to suspect, every one had
                        (forgetting that she had not), or at least something equivalent thereunto.
                        She admitted to herself that Hamlin was weak; nay, to do so was a sort of
                        relief. That Hamlin should come of a family infirm of will and often
                        vicious, that he should have been brought up surrounded by vice and violence
                        engendered by weakness; this notion,<pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7108-132"/> due
                        partly to her own observations, and confirmed by Mrs Macgregor’s
                        confidences, explained so much away, and left room for so much: it explained
                        all the wretched part of his nature, it left room for all the good, for the
                        gentleness, the generosity, the chivalric spirit which had made Anne what
                        she was; and it let her hope, every now and then, that better might be in
                        store. For since the evil was merely negative and the good so thorough and
                        so positive, surely the good would vanquish the evil. And, looking at the
                        people who surrounded Hamlin,—at these vain, weak, unreal poets and artists,
                        at this whole school of people who, whatever their private life, affected to
                        live only for selfish enjoyment of beauty and selfish interest in sin,—Anne
                        used often to think that Hamlin was in the position of a sort of Rinaldo,
                        the noblest of all heroes, degraded into mean sloth by the Armida of
                        æstheticism, but requiring only the shrill of the trumpet and the clash of
                        arms from the real living world to be redeemed and to show<pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7108-133"/> himself in his real nobility. She would even
                        exaggerate her aversion or contempt for Hamlin’s companions and for his
                        school; the worse they were, the more excuse for him; and she would often
                        sit dreaming of the way in which he might be gradually got from under their
                        influence, and brought in contact with those stronger, more healthy, or more
                        terrible realities, which Anne’s nature, by a kind of occult sympathy, felt
                        in the world all round, as the birds and insects will feel the storm which
                        is still invisible beyond the hills, but which is coming to purify, and
                        shake, and revive.</p>
                    <p>And so Anne went on loving and hoping, and believing herself to be happy. But
                        there began to be a strange restlessness about her; a desire to be useful,
                        to be perpetually active in something, to be always trying to understand,
                        and sympathise, and help—an imperious necessity not to be left to her own
                        thoughts (those thoughts which had once been like a <pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7108-134"/> paradise, in which solitude was the highest
                        bliss). For, alone with her own thoughts, Anne was beginning to experience
                        an intolerable sense of isolation, and intolerable sense of impotence.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
                    <p><hi>IN</hi> this condition of mind Anne was violently impelled towards the
                        two Leigh girls; and strongly induced to take an aversion to Edmund Lewis.
                        For the Leighs represented every day more and more the influence which was
                        strengthening her, the influence which might revive Hamlin; and Edmund Lewis
                        seemed sent as an incarnation of those tendencies which, in her belief, had
                        marred the nobility of Hamlin’s nature.</p>
                    <p>Anne’s unmistakable desire to know what was going on in the striving and
                        suffering world outside the strongholds of æstheticism, to help in it to her
                        utmost; to be, what the people believing only in beauty and passion could
                        not conceive, responsible,—all this intense<pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7108-136"/> striving got the better of Marjory Leigh’s prejudices. She began to
                        understand that she had found in Anne a zealous lieutenant; nay, after some
                        time, the conscientious though somewhat pig‐headed and conceited young
                        philanthropist admitted to herself that Anne was a force for work and good
                        which dragged even her along, making her, by the influence of her complete
                        unselfishness, self‐unconsciousness, and energy, more ready to examine into
                        her own mode of doing things, to sift her vanity from her
                        humanitarianism.</p>
                    <p>“Anne does make one less conceited,” Marjory one day remarked to her sister,
                        waking up from a long reverie—“less conceited and less narrow, I do believe.
                        It’s such a revelation; and somehow it makes one feel just a little bit
                        ashamed, to find such honesty and determination in an æsthete. After that,
                        people don’t seem to be so hopelessly lost—do they? I fear I must have been
                        a rather bigoted sort of brute formerly,” and Marjory pushed her fingers
                        through her short, lank<pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7108-137"/> yellow hair, and
                        looked up at her sister with her childish, resolute, defiant face, not yet
                        puzzled by the sad experience of the difficulty of doing good, and of the
                        dangerousness of even the wisest theories. Mary Leigh smiled. She was proud
                        of her little sister; and she was, in a sort of a way, in love with Anne
                        Brown. Marjory thought her rather æsthetic and spiritless, she knew; and
                        Anne was absorbed in her own thoughts; but Mary Leigh was one of those girls
                        who can resign themselves cheerfully to being second best, as long as they
                        are the best in their power—to be happy in her devotion, even if it be
                        unreciprocated; and she was happy, in a subdued way—proud of Marjory and
                        adoring Anne, and seeing that the two somewhat unresponsive objects of her
                        love could now appreciate one another.</p>
                    <p>So much for the Leighs. But if their presence at Wotton was a support and a
                        consolation to Anne, the presence of Edmund Lewis very soon grew to be a
                        positive source of <choice>
                            <orig>dis‐<pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7108-138"/> gust</orig>
                            <reg>disgust</reg>
                        </choice>. At first, in his egotistic, silently brow‐beating way, he was an
                        interesting visitor. He had travelled and read a good deal, and, in point of
                        fact, knew much more about literature than about his own art. His
                        imagination turned easily to the terrible; he considered Webster as greater
                        than Shakespeare, and Ford as greater than Webster; he had personal
                        experiences of more or less criminal persons, whose acquaintance, for the
                        sake of morbid psychology, he had sought, and whose characteristics he had
                        lovingly studied; while in reality mild and even milk‐soppish in his habits,
                        he seemed to experience a fascination from violence and bloodshed. For a
                        week or so he was decidedly interesting, if not, to Anne and her two
                        girl‐friends, attractive. But hostility soon arose. He was a fervid
                        spiritualist, and a great adept in mesmerising; his vanity made him see
                        mediums, victims of his will‐power, everywhere. He immediately discovered
                        one in Anne, and begged to be permitted to try his tricks, as Marjory Leigh
                        called them.</p>
                    <pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7108-139"/>
                    <p>Now, if there was one thing which was more abhorrent to Anne than any other,
                        it was spiritualism: averse to mysticism like every Italian; prosaic and
                        common‐sense, perhaps just in proportion to the idealism of passion and
                        aspiration, she was impatient of the vulgar mysteriousness of modern magic;
                        while at the same time her powerful personality, her austere will (which she
                        always recognised as the most precious part of her nature), which took
                        umbrage at Mrs Macgregor’s theories of obedience to mere physical passions,
                        was positively insulted by the notion of surrender to the perfectly
                        unintellectual will of another. However, she let Lewis try. During his
                        performance, as he fixed his green eyes upon her, and made passes with his
                        flabby white fingers, Anne felt a loathing as if a slug were trailing over
                        her, but she sat unaffected by Mr Lewis’s will‐power, and at last wearied
                        out his patience.</p>
                    <p>“You resisted!—I felt you resist!” cried Lewis angrily, at the end of the
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">séance</foreign>.</p>
                    <pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7108-140"/>
                    <p>“There was nothing to resist against,” answered Anne, bluntly; “but had there
                        been, of course I should have resisted.”</p>
                    <p>“Hamlin does not resist,” replied Lewis, with a certain malignant pride. “I
                        can do just whatever I choose with Hamlin.”</p>
                    <p>“I enjoy it,” explained Hamlin; “it’s like the first effects of opium or
                        haschisch. One feels one’s self giving way, one’s soul sinking
                        deliciously.”</p>
                    <p>“Going to sleep, in fact,” corrected Anne.</p>
                    <p>From that moment Anne felt that Lewis hated her. Yet he was, in a way,
                        fascinated by her exotic beauty; he could not make up his mind that so
                        strange and splendid a woman could resist him. He never tried to magnetise
                        her again; and he made many drawings of her, curiously distorting her
                        expression, sullen, but frank and resolute, into a kind of sombre, morbid
                        wistfulness.</p>
                    <p>“I hate those sketches he does of you,” cried Marjory one day; “nasty things,
                        which make you look—I don’t know to express it—<pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7108-141"/> as if you were neither a man nor a woman, and
                        were in love with <emph>him</emph>.”</p>
                    <p>Mary Leigh laughed. “The school is running to seed,” she said: “the great men
                        have done all that could be done in the way of beautiful suggestiveness—the
                        little ones can only do suggestiveness of all sorts of vague nastiness which
                        they don’t even understand. But there’s a change coming on in painting;
                        people are beginning to be satisfied with interpreting real nature;
                        and—don’t you think—Anne—a similar change . . .”</p>
                    <p>Mary Leigh, who was the most absent‐minded of Irish enthusiasts, suddenly
                        stopped short. She had only just remembered that Hamlin was a poet and a
                        painter of the school which she had just described. And a pained, darkened
                        look had come over Anne. Mary Leigh could not understand that that look
                        meant that Anne had often thought just the same thing, and that now there
                        returned to her, with sickening bitterness, the double<pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7108-142"/> recollection of the “Ballad of the Fens,” and of
                        those twelve sonnets called “Desire.”</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile Anne gradually got substantial reasons for her instinctive aversion
                        to Edmund Lewis. The family of the vicar of Wotton sometimes visited at the
                        Hall. There were two very young girls, scarcely more than children, for whom
                        Anne and the Leighs had taken a fancy. One afternoon they came to tea,
                        delicate pink‐and‐white creatures of fourteen or fifteen, impressionable,
                        nervous, utterly ignorant of the world. Hamlin seemed to appreciate the
                        charm of obvious purity and guilelessness which went with their ignorance of
                        the world.</p>
                    <p>“I should like to make a picture of those two creatures,” he whispered to
                        Anne, as they sat at tea in the library, “or to write a poem about them—they
                        seem to do one good; for it is good, is it not, to see so much life which is
                        so perfectly fresh, and unsullied, and untormented—such a desire to know the

                    <p>Even Chough could not make a single unintelligible allusion to the wife of
                        Claudius or the daughter of Alexander VI., but sat with one of his children
                        on his knee, looking at the young girls and gently humming a scrap of old
                        minuet, fresh and simple like themselves. Anne could not help thinking that
                        she had never been what these girls were. She had been shown the ugly things
                        of life, taught to struggle with them since her childhood, and now believing
                        equally in good, but believing sadly and bitterly. It was better to be a
                        woman as she was, a woman who knew of good and evil, and was prepared to
                        fight her way out of darkness; but still it was sad never, never to have
                        been as these girls. Edmund Lewis was leaning forward on the table, his
                        reddish‐auburn head with its glittering eyes rising like that of a snake, as
                        if silently trying to mesmerise the visitors.</p>
                    <p>“Suppose we show these young ladies some of our works of art?” he proposed,
                        in a half‐<pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7108-144"/> jocular way which he
                        occasionally had. The girls had never seen any pictures scarcely, and having
                        heard of Hamlin and Lewis as famous painters from London, were delighted.
                        The whole party went up to Hamlin’s studio. He showed the girls not the
                        things for which he cared most, but what he thought would give them most
                        pleasure—magnificent tinted sketches of poetical legends, of the Sleeping
                        Beauty, Cupid and Psyche, and so forth. Anne thought she had scarcely ever
                        seen Hamlin so nice before as when he got the sketches out of the portfolio,
                        and told the girls what they represented. When he had done, Edmund Lewis,
                        with his slow, shuffling movements, placed his large sketch‐book on an
                        easel, and turned a page. It was covered with outline drawings of men and
                        women, stark naked, in various listless attitudes.</p>
                    <p>Anne had seen these drawings time after time, and had thought them,
                        accustomed as she was to studios and painters, merely clever nude studies,
                        with the usual expression of<pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7108-145"/> bored
                        depravity of all Lewis’s work. She had criticised the drawing and anatomy,
                        and had never before thought that any impropriety was connected with them.
                        But now she could not help blushing and feeling vaguely indignant.</p>
                    <p>“That’s not the sort of thing to show those children,” whispered Mary Leigh,
                        who, heaven knows, had seen nude studies enough in her life. Both she and
                        Anne had caught the surprised, vacant expression of the two girls, had seen
                        the flush in their face, and understood the silence, never asking what it
                        all meant, as they stared at all this emaciated, flabby nakedness. And Anne
                        caught also Edmund Lewis’s expression, as he held the corner of the page,
                        ready to turn over, with one hand, stroking his reddish‐brown beard with the
                        other, and looking, with slightly raised eyebrows and curious green eyes,
                        towards Hamlin, as if to call his attention. Lewis turned another page, and
                        another; always the same stark‐naked people. Anne was very black. Heaven
                        knows from what instinct, perhaps from a paternal <choice>

                        edging himself awkwardly into the corner, he banged against the easel, and
                        made it and the sketch‐hook come down with a crash.</p>
                    <p>“Confound your awkwardness!” cried Lewis, stooping to pick up his drawings,
                        and slowly replacing the sketch‐book.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t think they care to see any more,” said Anne; “you see, these young
                        ladies haven’t studied anatomy. Supposing you show them your Eastern
                        sketches, Mr Lewis.”</p>
                    <p>Lewis gave Anne a rapid, angry glance. “The Eastern sketches are up‐stairs,”
                        he said snappishly; adding, in his drawling, mock courteous way, “I think
                        these young ladies have seen the best I could show them.”</p>
                    <p>“Then we had better go down‐stairs, and Mr Chough will play an accompaniment,
                        for I know they sing very nicely,” said Anne, taking no notice of him.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps, thought Anne, she might have been prejudiced against Edmund Lewis.
                            He<pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7108-147"/> did draw morbid‐looking nudities;
                        but so many other men did just the same, that it was quite possible he might
                        have displayed that sketch‐book from mere thoughtlessness. Yet she could not
                        believe it; she had seen Lewis’s look as he turned over the pages, and that
                        look had disgusted her.</p>
                    <p>The next day but one the question was settled in her mind. It was a fine
                        autumn morning, and Anne was seated on the terrace, waiting for the others
                        to come down to breakfast. The air, just touched by the first cold, was
                        exquisitely pure; and the sear bracken of the hillside opposite sparkled
                        golden with the heavy dew. All round the swallows were whirring about,
                        collecting for departure. The thought of the Villa Arnolfini—of the place in
                        the vineyard, among the yellowing vines, where she used to sit on the dry
                        warm mint and fennel with the little Perrys, where, under the big
                        mulberry‐tree, they had buried her Dante in a heap of yellow leaves—came
                        home to Anne. How good Hamlin had been to<pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7108-148"/>
                        her! the idea almost pained her. But this lovely morning seemed to have
                        swept all evil away. If only, Anne said to herself, Hamlin’s sympathies
                        could be violently roused—if only he could be awakened suddenly, by some
                        unexpected contact with the tragic realities of the world, by a sudden
                        appeal to his generosity and indignation, out of this æsthetic day‐dream
                        with its enervating visions of impure beauty and forbidden things. If only
                        this could be done, the horrid spell which kept him at a moral distance from
                        her would be broken through. . . . And soon it must come, this
                        awakening.</p>
                    <p>As she was thinking in this way, Edmund Lewis strolled up, his hands behind
                        his back, to the table at which she was seated. He gave her a little
                        unceremonious nod, and then, interrupting the tune which he was faintly
                        whistling, pushed a paper‐bound book across the table to her.</p>
                    <p>“Have you ever read this, Miss Brown?” he asked; “do you know that passage?
                            I<pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7108-149"/> think it one of the loveliest things
                        which have ever been written.”</p>
                    <p>Anne’s eye glanced at the page, pencil‐marked all round, and then at the
                        title on the margin. It was Gautier’s ‘Mademoiselle de Maupin.’ She
                        understood.</p>
                    <p>“I have never read it,” she answered, “but I have often heard that it is a
                        book which a man does not offer a woman except as an insult,” and she
                        quietly handed the volume back, looking up, her beautiful severe face
                        flushed, her slate‐grey eyes flashing, at Lewis.</p>
                    <p>The painter started.</p>
                    <p>“Upon my word,” he answered quickly, with his usual self‐possession, “I never
                        thought that. I never thought that any book could possibly offend a pure
                        woman nowadays. I regard this book merely as a noble hymn to beauty; others
                        may regard it otherwise. I really had no thought of offending you, my dear
                        Miss Brown”—there was a tone of patronising insolence in his voice.</p>
                    <p>“So much the better,” answered Anne, rising.</p>
                    <pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7108-150"/>
                    <p>Oh how, how could Hamlin, with his chivalrous nature, endure the daily
                        contact of such a man as this!</p>
                    <p>“Lewis ought not to have selected those particular drawings to show the
                        vicar’s girls,” said Anne, later on. She could not allude to that scene of
                        the book; but she felt she must say something. “A man ought not to show such
                        things as those to mere children, brought up in the country, who don’t know
                        what they mean, and are merely shocked by such things—don’t you think so,
                        Mary?”</p>
                    <p>“Certainly,” answered Mary Leigh boldly, quite astonished at Anne’s venturing
                        to mention such a subject.</p>
                    <p>“It wasn’t good taste, certainly,” answered Hamlin. “Lewis is fearfully
                        absent‐minded. They are lovely designs. But still, it wasn’t good taste, I
                        quite agree.”</p>
                    <p>“Good taste!” thought Anne, with a shudder. “Is there nothing higher than
                        taste in the world?”</p>

                    <p><hi>THREE</hi> days later, Chough and Lewis returned to town, and Hamlin went
                        with them. The weather had broken up, and it was time to settle for the
                        winter. Aunt Claudia and Anne were to stay on another fortnight, in order to
                        give Hamlin time to make some alterations in the house at Hammersmith. Such
                        at least was the pretext; but Anne knew that Madame Elaguine had arrived in
                        London, and she guessed that Hamlin would wish to transact whatever business
                        there might be, before exposing to Mrs Macgregor’s wrath the Cousin Sacha of
                        former days—before, perhaps, refusing to let Anne Brown meet a woman whose
                        past spoke little in her favour, and of whose present he knew absolutely
                        nothing.</p>
                    <pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7108-152"/>
                    <p>“How I dread seeing that woman!” he exclaimed the evening before his
                        departure, as he walked up and down the hall with Anne, while the rest of
                        the company was listening to Cosmo Chough, shrilly piping eighteenth century
                        music in the drawing‐room.</p>
                    <p>“Has Aunt Claudia ever told you anything of our life when Cousin Sacha was
                        here with us, years ago?” he asked.</p>
                    <p>Anne nodded.</p>
                    <p>“Aunt Claudia told me the whole story.”</p>
                    <p>“Then you can understand,” cried Hamlin, almost convulsively, “how the mere
                        thought of Sacha is loathsome to me; and yet, I must behave decently towards
                        her—don’t you think?”</p>
                    <p>“Of course you must; and I can’t help thinking that perhaps—well, that your
                        aunt and you may be a little unjust towards her—I don’t think that a child
                        really could be so bad.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, a child may be as bad as a woman if she have evil blood in her! and just
                        think, if<pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7108-153"/> Sacha was like that as a child,
                        what must she not be as a woman?”</p>
                    <p>There was something odd in his tone; something not of indignation, but of a
                        kind of clinging curiosity.</p>
                    <p>“I daresay,” said Anne, “that as a woman she may be much better than as a
                        child. Her eyes may have been opened to her own unworthiness, and she may
                        have struggled out of the influence of bad examples. I am sure many, many
                        people are much better as men and women than as children. To know, to feel
                        responsible, means so much.”</p>
                    <p>“That may be.” There was some disappointment in Hamlin’s tone.</p>
                    <p>Anne laughed.</p>
                    <p>“You want to find a fiend, a lamia, a vampire,” she said—“something hateful
                        and picturesque. Fancy if your cousin should turn out a most prosaic and
                        ultra‐respectable woman, given up to her children, and coffee‐taverns, and
                        women’s suffrage!”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin could not help laughing.</p>
                    <pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7108-154"/>
                    <p>“I fear there’s not much chance of that. Anyhow, I must see whether she is
                        fit for you to receive, and whether Aunt Claudia can be mollified towards
                        her, supposing she is the exemplary piece of prose which you imagine.”</p>
                    <p>Anne had induced Cosmo Chough to leave his little girls in her charge; and
                        the Leighs were to return to London with her and Aunt Claudia. The big house
                        seemed very empty without Hamlin and his friends; but the quiet was
                        pleasant. Somehow, when he was away, when she could no longer see him
                        perpetually sitting and walking with Edmund Lewis, Anne’s love for Hamlin
                        became much stronger. In her recollection he existed only with reference to
                        herself; she felt his goodness, she believed in his nobility, she felt sure
                        that some day he would become more manly, healthy, and resolute. If only she
                        could enter into his confidence, instead of men like Lewis and Dennistoun;
                        if only she could make him see all that there was in the world besides mere
                        art and poetry. Perhaps she was unworthy to<pb n="156" xml:id="VAB7108-155"/> do it. This thought spurred her on, redoubled Anne’s restless desire to
                        know, to sympathise, and to help.</p>
                    <p>Marjory Leigh had, soon after her arrival at Wotton, made acquaintance with
                        the wife of the vicar, a simple, energetic, rather narrow‐minded but
                        boundlessly unselfish woman, all whose thoughts were given to improving the
                        condition of the neighbouring poor. To tell the whole truth, the vicar had a
                        son, a young man entirely belying the usual saying about clergymen’s sons,
                        who had renounced a good living in the neighbourhood in order to become a
                        curate in the East End of London.</p>
                    <p>Harry Collett had been at Oxford at the same time as Hamlin; he had even, for
                        some time, belonged to the æsthetic set of which Hamlin and Melton Perry had
                        been the heads: but he had soon become a religious enthusiast; and, his
                        religious enthusiasm cooling down, he had remained an ardent philanthropist.
                        Hamlin had a liking for Harry Collett. He was handsome, tall, and emaciated,
                        like a St John<pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7108-156"/> the Baptist by Donatello;
                        he was in his own style poetical; he was a dreamer and an enthusiast. Hamlin
                        used to call him Francis of Assisi. He did several sketches of him, and
                        asked him several times to Wotton Hall. Anne also liked and admired him; but
                        there was something exaggerated, narrow‐minded, in him, which shocked her
                        Italian temperament. What she wanted was secular energy, not priestly
                        devotion.</p>
                    <p>“He is a monk,” she used to say; “he ought to have lived in the middle ages.
                        What we want nowadays are disagreeable, rough‐and‐ready men like Cousin
                        Dick—men who don’t merely feel sorry for vice, but who try to understand its
                        scientific reason.”</p>
                    <p>Marjory Leigh, who declared herself to belong to the most advanced of all
                        advanced parties, and to whom Richard Brown was little less than a god,
                        perfectly agreed in Anne’s verdict. But being of a proselytising temper, and
                        having a special love for proselytising among the young men of her
                        acquaintance, she <choice>
                            <orig>immedi‐<pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7108-157"/> ately</orig>
                            <reg>immediately</reg>
                        </choice> set about enlightening the rather High Church benevolence of Harry
                        Collett, as soon as he came to spend at Wotton his summer holidays. Anne and
                        Mary Leigh used often to laugh over the intensely serious flirtations which
                        were carried on between Marjory and the East End curate—flirtations of which
                        both parties were perfectly unaware—earnestly discussing charity
                        reorganisation, ventilation, primary instruction, and so forth; but which
                        was nevertheless destined to result, soon after the general return to town,
                        in a long engagement between Marjory and Harry Collett. Harry was already
                        back at his post in the East End; but Marjory, being unable to discuss
                        philanthropy with him, went daily to help his mother in her work. Thus it
                        was that Anne gradually became acquainted with the petty miseries of village
                        life, its dull indifference, mistaken by poets for innocence, and beneath
                        which lies so much possibility of stupid misery and stupid crime. “All that
                        must be improved some day,” Anne used to say; and<pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7108-158"/> she determined to ask Cousin Dick’s advice, for
                        she believed in radical measures rather than in the small palliations of the
                        vicar’s wife.</p>
                    <p>One afternoon—they were within three or four days of return to London—Marjory
                        Leigh returned more than usually excited from a visit to the vicarage.</p>
                    <p>“What’s the matter?” asked Anne, as the three girls sat alone in Hamlin’s
                        empty studio.</p>
                    <p>Marjory threw her hat on the floor. “Give me some tea,” she said, “I feel
                        quite sick; I never thought I should come across such horrors. Of course,”
                        she added quickly, before Anne or her sister had time to exclaim, and as if
                        to reclaim her reputation for omniscience—“of course I knew that such things
                        existed—oh dear, yes—in big towns and so forth; but still,”—and poor Marjory
                        fairly burst into tears,—“I never, never thought that—I should come so near
                        them.”</p>
                    <p>Finally, when she had had some tea, Marjory, all blushing and stammering, and
                        in a<pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7108-159"/> hesitating, roundabout way, which
                        curiously belied her usual affectation of cynical omniscience, proceeded to
                        explain what had just happened. A girl with an illegitimate baby—a very
                        common occurrence in those parts—had turned up for assistance at the
                        vicarage, and, while deprecating the wretched creature’s fault, the vicar’s
                        wife had revealed to Marjory Leigh a jealously hidden stain in her parish;
                        namely, that in the hamlet to which the girl belonged, a mishap, as she
                        termed it, like hers was a trifle, and indeed could scarcely be considered a
                        fault at all, compared with the condition of brutish sin in which rolled,
                        cynically huddled together in cabins no better than sties, the whole small
                        population of that foul little fen village.</p>
                    <p>“It appears it’s been going on for generations,” cried Marjory, “and that
                        there’s no hope of remedying things unless the miserable creatures be
                        removed into more decent dwellings. It’s useless trying to teach them to
                        live decently as long as they live there, in<pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7108-160"/> those hovels in the fen, where half of them are ill of fever every
                        autumn, and they herd together like cattle. Oh, it’s sickening to think of
                        Christian people being so sinful close by one!” and Marjory burst into
                        hysterical sobs.</p>
                    <p>Mary Leigh had exclaimed in horror as soon as Marjory’s meaning had become
                        plain to her.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, don’t cry, don’t cry, Marjory darling!” she exclaimed, throwing herself
                        on her knees and clasping her sister’s waist. “<emph>You</emph> can’t do
                        anything, my love—and you’ll only make yourself ill if you let yourself
                        brood on such things.”</p>
                    <p>Anne had not exclaimed. She sat perfectly still, and said nothing. Most
                        persons would have deemed her very callous, she looked so calm.</p>
                    <p>“Are you quite sure, Marjory,” she asked, after a minute—“are you quite sure
                        you did not misunderstand, or that Mrs Collett did not exaggerate?”</p>
                    <pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7108-161"/>
                    <p>“I couldn’t misunderstand; and Mrs Collett gave me ever so many details—such
                        dreadful details;” and interrupted by her sobs, Marjory repeated scraps of
                        what she had heard.</p>
                    <p>“Where is the place?” asked Anne, after another pause.</p>
                    <p>“It’s that cluster of houses half‐way to Eggleston, in the middle of the fen,
                        by the river—they call it Cold Fremley. Don’t you remember our going down
                        there once in the break, with the Spencers and Chough, and your saying you
                        wished Hamlin would paint that sort of fiat green country, and Mrs Spencer
                        saying it was unpoetical?”</p>
                    <p>Anne remembered. The recollection of that moment came like a vision; she saw
                        the wide river, between its low sedgy banks of boggy green; the reddish
                        storm sunset reflected in clotted flame‐coloured masses in its thick grey
                        waters; the moon rising, a spectral crescent on the blue evening sky; she
                        heard the quail of the frogs, the cries of the water‐fowl: the Spencers and
                        Chough on ahead with the two<pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7108-162"/> Leighs and
                        Harry Collett; and she and Hamlin lingering behind, watching the reddened
                        stream—and the cattle, dark outlines on the flat green banks opposite;
                        Hamlin scrambling down the bank to get a tuft of willow herb growing half in
                        the water. She was feeling so happy; Hamlin was so good and gentle and
                        handsome, and she loved him so; and they two had stood by the river alone,
                        until the little Spencer children had run back and taken her hand, and begun
                        asking a hundred questions in their shrill baby lisp. It was so lovely and
                        peaceful and good, this green country, this quiet evening, with Hamlin by
                        her side and the children holding her hand. She had felt a painful longing
                        to impress the place and the moment on her mind, to keep this happy present.
                        “What is this called?” she had asked; and Hamlin had answered “Cold
                        Fremley.” Cold Fremley! Anne went on repeating to herself all that
                        afternoon: the recollection of that beautiful scene, become hideous like a
                            nightmare,<pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7108-163"/> haunted her. The huddled
                        roofs dark in the distance, the curl of smoke—that was the place. Anne felt
                        dizzy. She had read enough about shame and sin, heaven knows; the poems of
                        the poets of the set were full of allusions to such things. But she had
                        never realised that they could be realities; they had been so many artistic
                        dabs of horror, imaginary, or belonging vaguely to some distant, dim world,
                        as unreal as the beautiful haunted woods and mysterious castles, the pale
                        unsubstantial gods and heroes, and men and women of the pictures of Rossetti
                        and Burne Jones, of the poems of Swinburne and Morris, and Hamlin and
                        Chough. But that abominations like these should be here, close at hand, in
                        sordid, filthy reality, reality under this same sun, swept by this same
                        wind, reality through which she had unconsciously walked; this seemed
                        impossible. A strange thing happened: the thought of what she had heard
                        haunted her so persistently, loomed before her in such ever‐changing horror,
                        that Anne at<pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7108-164"/> last felt like one drunk or
                        half asleep, and began to doubt whether it was not all a horrible nightmare.
                        Had Marjory really told her these things? Before a court of justice Anne
                        would have been unable to say whether she had or not. It was so unreal to
                        her that she could not accept it as a reality; the more she brooded, the
                        more did it seem a hallucination.</p>
                    <p>“Marjory,” said Anne the next day, suddenly, “is it true that you told me
                        some dreadful things which you had heard from Mrs Collett about the people
                        at Cold Fremley?”</p>
                    <p>Marjory looked up in astonishment.</p>
                    <p>“Of course it is,”—she had half forgotten it herself.</p>
                    <p>“I cannot get it out of my mind,” said Anne, passing her hand over her eyes,
                        as if to disperse some black mist; “it is too horrible. Everything in the
                        world seems tarnished, don’t you know, and a sort of horrible clamminess all
                        round.”</p>
                    <p>Marjory looked at Anne. She was very pale, and her big, greyish‐blue,
                            onyx‐coloured<pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7108-165"/> eyes were wide with a
                        fixed stare. She looked as if she did indeed see the tarnish on the world,
                        and felt the clamminess; as if, like a person taken with some fever, she
                        tasted copper on her tongue.</p>
                    <p>Marjory was a sensible girl. She had studied medicine, and knew an appalling
                        amount about direction of the will, expectant attention, and other
                        psychological and physiological matters. “Anne,” she said, “you are making
                        yourself ill about this matter. Of course you couldn’t help being shocked;
                        but you take it too much to heart. You are going to let these horrible
                        things haunt you; it is a great temptation to do so. Take care; it won’t do
                        any good, and you will merely get quite unstrung. I warn you against it. You
                        mustn’t let such things get the better of your will: it’s morbid, and
                        dangerous, and unworthy,”—and Marjory completely forgot how she herself had
                        entered the room in hysterics the previous day.</p>
                    <p>Anne took no notice of her speech. “You say nothing can be done until these
                        people be<pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7108-166"/> given better dwellings?” she
                        asked, after a pause.</p>
                    <p>Marjory nodded. “So Mrs Collett says, and I’ve read that repeatedly in books
                        also—for, of course, such things have happened elsewhere. At all events, the
                        children might be brought up to live more decently, if they were not all
                        huddled up together like that.”</p>
                    <p>A thought seemed to flash across Anne’s darkened mind. Her maid had just
                        brought in the tea‐things.</p>
                    <p>“Laura,” she asked, “do you know to whom Cold Fremley—those cottages by the
                        river, half‐way to Eggleston—belongs?”</p>
                    <p>“I can ask Mr Hamlin’s steward, miss—he’s just in the housekeeper’s room,”
                        answered Laura.</p>
                    <p>“Run and ask,” ordered Anne.</p>
                    <p>“Good heavens, Anne!” cried Mary Leigh, “what <emph>are</emph> you going to
                        do! You surely aren’t going to talk about such things and try to interfere!
                        What can you do, when Mrs Collett has failed?”</p>
                    <pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7108-167"/>
                    <p>“The houses must be rebuilt,” answered Anne, quietly and firmly; “to
                        whomsoever they belong, they must—they shall be rebuilt.”</p>
                    <p>“Nonsense!” cried practical Marjory; “how can you talk like that? Are you
                        going to apply to the neighbouring squires and tell them about such
                        matters?”</p>
                    <p>“They must rebuild the houses if once they understand,” repeated Anne. “I
                        don’t care to whom they belong—they shall be rebuilt. I will write and speak
                        to every one and any one on the subject, until the thing has been done.”</p>
                    <p>“It’s all very well, but when it comes to the point, you wouldn’t venture to
                        mention such a thing to a man,” cried Marjory,
                        contemptuously—“I—wouldn’t.”</p>
                    <p>At this moment the maid entered.</p>
                    <p>“The steward says that Cold Fremley—those houses by the river,
                        leastways—belong to Mr Hamlin, and as it’s he that lets them out.”</p>
                    <pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7108-168"/>
                    <p>Marjory and her sister looked at each other and then at Anne, as much as to
                        say, “Well, you see now what it would be.” Anne flushed scarlet, but her
                        face brightened.</p>
                    <p>“I will speak to Mr Hamlin,” she said, as soon as the maid’s back was turned.
                        Her voice faltered a little; but it was from sudden surprise, not from
                        hesitation.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Annie, dear, you’ll find that you can’t!” exclaimed Mary Leigh; “you’ll
                        find it impossible.”</p>
                    <p>“At all events, you’ll have to put it through your aunt,” suggested
                        Marjory.</p>
                    <p>“Through Aunt Claudia?” cried Anne. “Do you think she will make him feel it?
                        Why, she will answer that such things are going on all round us, and worse
                        ones. No; I shall speak to Mr Hamlin himself: he is the proprietor of
                        Fremley; and he is responsible.”</p>
                    <p>“You’ll never be able to do so,” insisted Mary; “you think you will, but you
                        can’t. Fancy saying all that to a man—and to a man who is in love with
                        you!”</p>
                    <pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7108-169"/>
                    <p>“What must be done, must be done,” answered Anne. “It’s not a question of
                        liking or disliking. Mr Hamlin’s a man, and I am a woman, and I daresay men
                        and women don’t talk about such things. But Mr Hamlin is the proprietor of
                        Cold Fremley, and that’s all I have to do with.”</p>
                    <p>The Leighs looked at her with incredulous astonishment. It seemed so simple
                        to her.</p>

                    <p><hi>IT</hi> was raining when they arrived in London—a warmish, brown, clammy
                        autumn day. The streets were a porridge of liquid mud, whose trail dragged
                        along the wet asphalt; the houses were staring forth, a livid dirt‐grey, in
                        the thin rain; and the sky, the very rain, was befouled with grime. Only
                        drays splashed through the mud, and carriages carrying hurried‐looking
                        people; children, still in their tattered summer cottons and battered straw
                        hats, stared in at the shops, the broad sheen from whose brilliant windows
                        was caught up by the wet pavement, and lingered out, in broken reflections,
                        in the brown ooze of the thoroughfare. Along the deserted suburban streets
                        every second house seemed to be a<pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7108-172"/>
                        gin‐palace, with shining coloured globes, and stucco pinnacles soaked with
                        rain, and ground‐glass windows shining out like a leprosy of white. Mrs
                        Macgregor closed her eyes in disgust. Even the maid looked depressed. But
                        Anne stared out of the window of the carriage at all the hideous soppy
                        sordidness, which seemed to soil and soak black into one’s mind; and she
                        felt glad. All this was reality: it was the world in which lay her
                        redemption, and the redemption of Hamlin.</p>
                    <p>Anne found Hamlin full of his cousin Sacha, upon whom he had already called
                        three times, and in whom, to his surprise, he had found not a trace of the
                        child whom he had hated; but a respectable, unworldly young mother, devoted
                        to her children, timid, and only deserving a little sympathy.</p>
                    <p>“She is a very curious woman,” he said, “evidently excellent at bottom; but I
                        don’t know whether I quite like her. She has something very strange about
                        her,—handsome; and at the same time—I don’t know exactly <pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7108-173"/> what it is—charming, but not quite reassuring. I
                        am so anxious for you to see her.”</p>
                    <p>“I am so awfully glad she’s nice,” exclaimed Anne. “Do you know, she weighed
                        upon me like a nightmare after all Aunt Claudia had said. It seemed too
                        horrible that such a creature should exist; and I felt sure it was all
                        prejudice against the poor little thing.”</p>
                    <p>“Don’t be in such a hurry,” laughed Hamlin; “perhaps you won’t like her after
                        all. There is something uncanny about her, decidedly.”</p>
                    <p>“I’m sure that’s all your imagination. You’re always thinking that things are
                        uncanny: it comes of writing too much about proud, pale, evil women, and
                        that sort of nonsense.”</p>
                    <p>Anne felt really glad. That the terrible Cousin Sacha, the fiend‐child of
                        Wotton Hall, should turn out a respectable, unworldly young woman, devoted
                        to her children, seemed to her like the first breaking of the spell which
                        hung over Hamlin. She felt no jealousy of Cousin Sacha; for, as Hamlin spoke
                        of Madame Elaguine, it was obvious that if he was anxious to<pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7108-174"/> show her to Anne, he was equally impatient to
                        display his beautiful ward to her, who had evidently been told a great deal
                        about her already.</p>
                    <p>The next day Madame Elaguine was to call on Anne. Mrs Macgregor took the
                        announcement in a spirit of sombre defiance. “She may come,” she said, “but
                        I will not see her. What o’clock is the creature coming?”</p>
                    <p>“Four,” answered Hamlin.</p>
                    <p>“Very well; then I’ll order the brougham for half‐past three, and go and make
                        some calls. Anne may stay behind if she likes.”</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, at half‐past three, Mrs Macgregor rolled off in the brougham to
                        Mrs Argiropoulo’s, and to various other people whom she declared she hated.
                        At four o’clock Hamlin came up‐stairs from his studio, and Anne gave him
                        some tea. “She will be here in a minute,” he said.</p>
                    <p>There was a noise of wheels; Anne felt her hand tremble as she poured out a
                        second cup for Hamlin.</p>
                    <p>“There! I’ve gone and spilt it on your cuff!<pb n="177" xml:id="VAB7108-175"/> Isn’t it idiotic of me to feel flurried about seeing your cousin?”</p>
                    <p>But the wheels passed on. More wheels, which also passed; rings and knocks;
                        but no Madame Elaguine. Hamlin, at every false alarm, got up and looked at
                        Anne—a long, admiring look at her stately figure and her strange pale face,
                        with the overhanging masses of crimp black hair; at the splendid postures,
                        of which only Michelangelo seemed to have ever understood the magnificent
                        weary weightiness into which she naturally fell.</p>
                    <p>“She is evidently not coming,” he said with some irritation, as the clock
                        struck five; “it’s too bad, keeping one in for nothing, like this!”</p>
                    <p>“I didn’t want to go out with Aunt Claudia; and I don’t see how you could
                        have gone on painting after dark.”</p>
                    <p>“Still it is too annoying.”</p>
                    <p>“I daresay it’s not so easy to go paying visits at Hammersmith when one has
                        children to attend to.”</p>
                    <pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7108-176"/>
                    <p>“Bother the children! she might leave them to a nurse.”</p>
                    <p>At that moment a cab stopped, and there came a knock.</p>
                    <p>“That’s she!” cried Hamlin, and he ran down‐stairs.</p>
                    <p>Madame Elaguine entered; in the dusk Anne could scarcely see her face: she
                        was rather below the average height, but so slender that she looked tall;
                        there was something very shy about her, and Anne could understand her
                        shyness.</p>
                    <p>“I am so glad you have come,” she said; “we had almost given you up.”</p>
                    <p>“I fear I am very late—perhaps in your way,” said Madame Elaguine; “the fact
                        is, I had to take my little girl to choose a doll, and she took nearly an
                        hour about it,” and she laughed a little shy laugh. She had a beautiful
                        voice, high and silvery, and yet warm and caressing, like a child’s, which
                        inevitably made you think of delicate green leaves, and fields whitened with
                        budding clover, and all sorts of young and tender things. She<pb n="179" xml:id="VAB7108-177"/> was very thin, almost emaciated, and with a
                        slight droop of the head: it was too dark for Anne to see her features
                        distinctly, but she seemed pretty, and frail, and wasted. There was
                        something in that childish voice which touched Anne; her strong, rebellious
                        disbelief in the horrible Sacha of Mrs Macgregor came indignantly to
                        her.</p>
                    <p>“It is very good of you to let me come and see you,” said Madame Elaguine,
                        after some trifling conversation, “and very good of my cousin to propose it;
                        because,” and her voice, in a sudden outburst of frankness, became just a
                        little tremulous, “Walter must have a very painful recollection of me. It
                        was a very unhappy time when we were last together, and I often think with
                        shame of what I was then—what a wretched, badly brought up, bad‐hearted
                        child I was.”</p>
                    <p>“If you had been a bad‐hearted child,” cried Anne, “you could not be what you
                        are now, you could not speak as you do now. I don’t believe it.”</p>
                    <pb n="180" xml:id="VAB7108-178"/>
                    <p>Madame Elaguine sighed.</p>
                    <p>“At all events,” she said, “the question now is no longer what I was or what
                        I am, but what my children are to be. I am played out; I only hope I may
                        live to see them on the road to being happier and more useful creatures than
                        I have been.”</p>
                    <p>There was something in that clear soft voice, with its just perceptible
                        daintiness of Russian pronunciation, making the English words not less
                        English, but more distinct and liquid, which made what from any one else
                        might have seemed strange, quite natural and simple.</p>
                    <p>“You have come to settle in England?” asked Anne.</p>
                    <p>“Yes; at least if it is possible for me ever to settle anywhere. I have been
                        a rolling stone so long, or rather such a feather carried hither and thither
                        by the wind, that I can scarcely believe in settling anywhere; and then,
                        perhaps, I may not be permitted to stay where I should be happy. But I want
                        my boy to become an Englishman, and at the<pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7108-179"/>
                        same time I haven’t the heart to let him go away from me.”</p>
                    <p>“Why should you not settle?” asked Anne; “surely you will be much happier
                        near your child.”</p>
                    <p>“Why may I never do what I wish?” exclaimed Madame Elaguine, with a curious
                        wildness; “why may I not be left to live in peace like any other
                        insignificant woman, whose life has been a failure? I am not my own
                        mistress.”</p>
                    <p>“Bring lights,” ordered Hamlin, who had summoned the servants. He was
                        impatient that the two women should see each other, impatient to display to
                        his cousin the magnificent creature which belonged to him.</p>
                    <p>They had begun discussing various school‐plans for Madame Elaguine’s children
                        when the lamps were brought in. Anne was surprised when she saw Hamlin’s
                        cousin distinctly; she had imagined her pretty and delicate in an ordinary
                        way, but there was nothing commonplace about this woman. She was pale, and
                        of almost ghastly thinness, and<pb n="182" xml:id="VAB7108-180"/> her
                        features, despite her small size, were large, and perhaps a little gaunt. It
                        struck Anne that she had seen a face like that before, and later she
                        discovered that what Madame Elaguine made her think of was Sarah Bernhardt
                        in one of her girlish parts, or as her face looked under the little cap of
                        Coppée’s page‐boy. It was a charming, frank, worn, yet childish face, full
                        of movement,—a face which seemed to vibrate like a delicate instrument—not
                        exactly beautiful nor exactly lovable, but interesting and fascinating. It
                        seemed to Anne that she could perfectly understand the past of this woman: a
                        highly nervous, delicate nature, not earnest but passionate, easily turned
                        into the very best or the very worst; and she felt more than ever indignant
                        at the thought of the corruption in contact with which this mobile
                        impressionable creature had come as a child,—at the thought of all the
                        unintentional shame which this woman must look back upon in her
                        childhood.</p>
                    <p>While they were talking, Sacha Elaguine<pb n="183" xml:id="VAB7108-181"/> was
                        equally busy looking at Anne; and Anne puzzled her.</p>
                    <p>“Either a volcano or an iceberg, or both,” said the little Russian to
                        herself, as she looked at Anne’s solemn, unruffled, and yet tragic
                        beauty.</p>
                    <p>At that moment a carriage stopped at the door. Hamlin went to the window. He
                        looked rather pale and puzzled as he came back.</p>
                    <p>“Let me show you my studio, Sacha,” he said hurriedly; “we can get there
                        quickest by a little back‐stair out of the library. Will you come?”</p>
                    <p>Anne understood. Mrs Macgregor, who had gone out expecting Madame Elaguine to
                        come an hour earlier, had returned, and Hamlin dreaded a scene. But Madame
                        Elaguine understood also.</p>
                    <p>“Your aunt has returned,” she said; “yes, I’m sure she has—that’s why you
                        want to hide me away; you are afraid of a scene . . .”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin hesitated; but Madame Elaguine<pb n="184" xml:id="VAB7108-182"/>
                        seemed to pin him down with her rapid glance.</p>
                    <p>“Well, yes,” he said; “what’s the use of mincing matters? You know how
                        unreasonable Aunt Claudia always was, and what a prejudice she had against
                        you.”</p>
                    <p>“And has still; I can believe it. But look here,” and the little emaciated
                        creature rapidly stopped Hamlin as he was raising the curtain into the next
                        room—“I am not going to be hid away. Your aunt has every reason to hate me,
                        and to be angry at finding me here. But I am not coming into her house on
                        the sly—I won’t be hidden away. Your aunt may say what she likes to me, but
                        she shall see me here.”</p>
                    <p>“I think Madame Elaguine is quite right,” said Anne, though she knew full
                        well what sort of reception Mrs Macgregor was likely to give to the detested
                        Sacha. “I quite understand her feeling.”</p>
                    <p>“But you are not coming into Aunt Claudia’s house on the sly,” insisted
                        Hamlin. “In the<pb n="185" xml:id="VAB7108-183"/> first place, this house is
                        not Aunt Claudia’s house, but Miss Brown’s house. Aunt Claudia, like you and
                        me, is merely Miss Brown’s guest, and you have come to see Miss Brown. In
                        the second place, my aunt knew you were coming, and went out expressly to
                        avoid meeting you.”</p>
                    <p>Madame Elaguine listened with a slight look of contempt.</p>
                    <p>“So much the better if I am not intruding behind her back. And it is very
                        considerate of Mrs Macgregor to save me what she knows must be a painful
                        scene. But besides Mrs Macgregor, I have myself to think of. I wish to see
                        your aunt. I wish to have the satisfaction of telling her, that however much
                        she may hate the remembrance of me, she cannot hate it more than I do.”</p>
                    <p>There was something theatrical in this which took Hamlin by surprise; but it
                        was the theatricalness of a quixotic and passionate temper, and Anne liked
                        Madame Elaguine for it.</p>
                    <p>“I want to see Mrs Macgregor,” repeated<pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7108-184"/> the
                        Russian; “but I don’t want to inflict it upon you, Miss Brown. Indeed I fear
                        it is very ill‐bred and very selfish of me to come to your house merely to
                        make a disagreeable scene: still I can’t resist the desire,” and she shook
                        her little head with its close pale‐yellow curls and deep brown eyes,
                        “only—don’t stay —just tell your aunt that I am here, and that I want to see
                        her.”</p>
                    <p>“I will go and tell Aunt Claudia,” said Anne.</p>
                    <p>But as she spoke, Mrs Macgregor entered. The old lady was short‐sighted; and
                        in that room, where the light, concentrated on a few spots, left all the
                        more shadow all round, she did not at first notice the presence of a
                        stranger.</p>
                    <p>“Well, is she gone?” she asked savagely.</p>
                    <p>“Madame Elaguine is here, Aunt Claudia,” answered Anne, quietly.</p>
                    <p>“Here!” exclaimed Mrs Macgregor—“ still in this house!”</p>
                    <p>“And she has remained,” went on Anne, with a weighty coldness which often
                            put<pb n="187" xml:id="VAB7108-185"/> down the old lady’s ebullitions,
                        “because she wants to see you again.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin was standing by the piano. How he wished his cousin at the devil for
                        inflicting such a scene upon him!</p>
                    <p>“The insolence!” muttered Mrs Macgregor.</p>
                    <p>But Madame Elaguine had come forward and stretched out her hand.</p>
                    <p>“I could not come here without seeing you, Aunt Claudia,” she said, in her
                        clear voice. “I want to tell you that, badly, as I behaved as a child, and
                        cruelly unjust though you were towards me, I bear you no ill‐will, and only
                        wish to ask for your forgiveness.”</p>
                    <p>She had sat down opposite to Mrs Macgregor. Hamlin’s aunt scanned her from
                        head to foot; she was taken by surprise, shaken throughout her nature, and
                        at a loss how to answer.</p>
                    <p>“So you are Sacha Polozoff,” said Mrs Macgregor at length, slowly. “I know
                        all the fine trash which Anne talks about the woman not being the same as
                        the child—<pb n="188" xml:id="VAB7108-186"/> maybe; I hope so, for your
                        sake. As to forgiveness, you have mine: but forgiveness is only an empty
                        word; it does not cancel what has been done, neither from the memory of God
                        nor of man. Here; <emph>I</emph> forgive you, and take it for what it is
                        worth.”</p>
                    <p>And she stretched out her hand with a bitter smile.</p>
                    <p>Madame Elaguine stooped down and kissed that shaking old hand.</p>
                    <p>“Whatever your forgiveness is worth, I take it joyfully; it cannot undo the
                        past, and it cannot put an end to injustice and hatred,—so far it is
                        worthless. But to me it gives a new life, because I have been able at last
                        to ask forgiveness, to admit all the mischief I have ever done, and to cast
                        away the faults of my childhood from my own clean self,”—she spoke very low,
                        and with tears in her voice, but with passion and pride.</p>
                    <p>“I am happy that you feel so comfortable,” replied Mrs Macgregor, “and that I
                        have been conducive thereto. I am happy also to make<pb n="189" xml:id="VAB7108-187"/> your acquaintance, Madame Elaguine, and I hope
                        you will not deprive my nephew and niece of your society on my account.”</p>
                    <p>Sacha bowed; the insult seemed to trickle off her. Anne half wondered, half
                        admired. She could not in the least understand the kind of character which
                        prompted such a useless and hollow ceremony as this; but as to Madame
                        Elaguine, this solemn act of self‐humiliation seemed necessary and just; she
                        admired her for having the courage to carry out her intention.</p>
                    <p>“Good‐bye,” said Madame Elaguine, as Anne accompanied her into the anteroom.
                        “I must beg your forgiveness a thousand, thousand times for having made a
                        scene in your house. You see, I am a badly brought‐up woman: I was never
                        taught to do anything except what I liked; and I am what I am, and must say
                        what I feel.”</p>
                    <p>Her tone was very appealing.</p>
                    <p>“Will you forgive me, Madame Elaguine,” said Anne, in her earnest, solemn
                        way, “if I<pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7108-188"/> tell you, what it is perhaps a
                        liberty to tell you, that I have always thought my aunt very unjust towards
                        you?”</p>
                    <p>The little thin woman looked up in Anne’s face.</p>
                    <p>“You are good,” she said. “Will you give me a kiss?”</p>
                    <p>Anne stooped down and kissed her shyly on her wan cheek. But a sort of
                        shudder passed through her as her own lips touched that hot face, and grazed
                        the light hair, which seemed to give out some faint Eastern perfume. This
                        woman was so unlike anything she had ever seen—so unlike her own simple
                        self.</p>
                    <p>“You will come and see me—and see my children—won’t you?” asked Madame
                        Elaguine. “I think it will do me good to know you.” She was very excited,
                        and she gasped as if her heart were beating like bursting.</p>
                    <p>“I will come with Mr Hamlin,” said Anne.</p>
                    <p>“She is a strange creature,” said Hamlin, as he followed Anne up‐stairs from
                        the door. “Didn’t I tell you she was uncanny?”</p>
                    <pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7108-189"/>
                    <p>“I don’t see anything uncanny about her. She is very nervous and
                        excitable—very Russian, I should say—and accustomed always to follow her
                        impulses; but I think she is a brave little woman.”</p>
                    <p>“I can’t make her out. Did you notice her mouth? it looks as if it would
                        bite: and she has strange eyes; one looks into them, and finds she has
                        merely drawn out one’s soul without showing her own.”</p>
                    <p>Anne laughed. “Poor little woman! Fancy what her feelings would be if she
                        ever knew all that! I wonder, by the way, whether you ever thought me
                        strange, and told people that I had. a mouth which would bite, and eyes in
                        which you get drowned?”</p>
                    <p>“I always thought,” answered Hamlin, looking at Anne, and seeing her again in
                        that close‐fitting white bodice, with rolled‐up sleeves, bending her
                        magnificent head over the iron‐board in the little nursery, with frescoes of
                        blue skies, and blue seas, and ducks, and people in boats, at the Villa
                        Arnolfini—“I always<pb n="192" xml:id="VAB7108-190"/> thought that you had
                        something strange in you, Miss Brown; some terrible thing to do or to suffer
                        in the future; some great passion or action—I don’t know clearly what, but
                        something heroic; and I think so now—”</p>
                    <p>Anne smiled; but she took his words to heart, for somehow that same
                        impression which he said he had received from her face she had had vaguely
                        in her heart.</p>
                    <p>“I hope the strangeness may consist in being a tolerably well‐behaved and
                        useful young woman,” she said, “and—a tolerably grateful one.”</p>

                    <p>“<hi>I WONDER</hi> whether Anne Brown has really spoken about that Cold
                        Fremley business to Mr Hamlin,” remarked Marjory Leigh to her sister one
                        day, soon after their return to town. “<emph>I</emph> think she’ll never do
                        it, after all.”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t see how she can,” answered Mary; “at least I can’t conceive doing
                        such a thing. But I don’t think we must judge Anne by ourselves: when once
                        she thinks something ought to be done, she is quite capable of forcing
                        herself to do it. Anne is quite unlike any one else.”</p>
                    <p>“Fiddlestick!” cried Marjory; “you don’t know anything about women,
                        Mary.”</p>
                    <p>But despite her sister’s superior knowledge of womankind and of everything
                        else, Mary<pb n="194" xml:id="VAB7108-192"/> Leigh was in the right; perhaps
                        in some cases enthusiastic admiration gives a better clue to action than
                        mere common‐sense. Anne really was made in such a way that when once she was
                        persuaded that any course was the right one, no dislike which she might have
                        to it, no thought of being considered queer, or improper, or quixotic, could
                        restrain her from it. The thing became none the pleasanter to do; but it was
                        done unflinchingly: indeed there was in Anne an almost destructive quality
                        of will, a power of ruthlessly cutting through all obstacles, the passing
                        consciousness of which, joined with the consciousness of the many
                        disagreeable things which it might at any moment force her to go through,
                        produced in her a curious kind of pessimism, which, while it recognised the
                        evil of the world, made that very recognition an incitement to struggle for
                        good. Anne had made up her mind that Hamlin must have the horrible condition
                        of his Cold Fremley tenants explained to him. She fully appreciated the
                        unseemliness, the <choice>
                            <orig>pain‐<pb n="195" xml:id="VAB7108-193"/> fulness</orig>
                            <reg>painfulness</reg>
                        </choice>, of such a revelation coming from her; but as there appeared to be
                        no one else who could satisfactorily make it to him, it must be made by her.
                        “It is very simple,” she said to herself: and this was the most
                        characteristic remark that Anne could ever make; for it is curious how very
                        much simpler life does become to people who are in the habit of acting
                        without regard for their own feelings.</p>
                    <p>But it was, though simple, difficult, not on her own account, but on
                        Hamlin’s. In the first few days after her return from Wotton, she had
                        several times been on the point of broaching the subject, but she had
                        desisted on noticing the absolute want of seriousness in Hamlin’s manner,
                        the æsthetic vagueness and fickleness of his thoughts. “He will do nothing
                        practical in this mood,” she said to herself; and as, time after time, she
                        watched for a propitious moment without finding it, Anne became painfully
                        aware, as one becomes aware of some deficiency in a valued piece of property
                        only when it is pointed out, of <choice>
                            <orig>Ham‐<pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7108-194"/> lin’s</orig>
                            <reg>Hamlin’s</reg>
                        </choice> want of seriousness, of his utter want of any habit of asking
                        himself about his responsibilities, or indeed of thinking about anything
                        except himself and the beautiful and weird things which delighted him.</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps it is cowardice on my part,” Anne suddenly thought; “perhaps I find
                        that he is not fit to attend to the subject because I dislike mentioning
                        it.” So it must be done at once. Hamlin, she knew, was alone in his studio;
                        he must have finished his afternoon’s work, or very nearly, and there was no
                        Chough, or Lewis, or Dennistoun on the horizon. So Anne closed the piano at
                        which she had been practising some of Chough’s favourite old music, and went
                        down‐stairs. She had made up her mind; but, as she went slowly to the
                        studio, she felt her heart begin to flutter and to beat, and a cold
                        perspiration to start out in her forehead. For all her familiarity with the
                        æsthetic world, in whose apprehension, as Thaddy O’Reilly’s Yankee friend
                        had quietly remarked, “right or wrong don’t exist,”—for<pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7108-195"/> all her habit of reading poems in which every
                        unmentionable shamefulness was used as so much vermilion or pale‐green or
                        mysterious grey in a picturesque and suggestive composition,—Anne had
                        retained a constitutional loathing for touching some subjects, which was
                        like the blind instinctive horror of certain animals for brackish water or
                        mud. When Marjory Leigh had first taken her into her confidence, and told
                        her of the pools of sin which stagnated among the starving, unwashed, and
                        unlettered million, Anne had recoiled, and felt a sort of momentary horror
                        for Marjory, a sort of resentment at this foulness thus obtruded on to her;
                        and this feeling, which would sometimes still recur while talking with her
                        philanthropic friend, was perhaps the thing in all her life of which Anne
                        was the most profoundly ashamed. The æsthetes all round her would let all
                        the world rot away in physical hideousness rather than have that physical
                        hideousness put before their eyes; and she, was she not even worse, in her
                        cowardly horror of seeing moral wounds<pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7108-196"/> and
                        leprosies? So Anne argued with herself; and she would now face anything; but
                        the feeling of moral sickness was there, however bravely she might look at
                        evil, and try and help to remedy it.</p>
                    <p>“I am a base creature,” Anne thought as she felt her heart fluttering as if
                        it would break loose, as she stood and knocked at the studio door.</p>
                    <p>“Come in,” cried Hamlin.</p>
                    <p>He thought it was the servant, for at first he did not turn round, but
                        continued writing at a beautiful, fantastically inlaid desk in a corner.</p>
                    <p>“It’s I,” said Anne.</p>
                    <p>He started up to meet her.</p>
                    <p>“How sweet of you to come, Madonna Anna!” he said, beaming; “I was just
                        wanting so much to see you—I don’t know why—a sort of silly, nostalgic wish.
                        It’s ridiculous to be nostalgic about a person who is on the first floor,
                        when I am on the ground floor, isn’t it? and yet it is so. I was feeling
                        quite an over‐<pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7108-197"/> powering desire to see you.
                        And you seem to have felt it, through the ceiling, carpets and all, don’t
                        you?”</p>
                    <p>Anne smiled faintly, but her heart sank.</p>
                    <p>“I also wanted you to see how I have been getting on with my Beatrice,” he
                        said, and rolled an easel into the middle of the room. Anne stood for a
                        moment before the almost Giorgionesquely magnificent picture, looking
                        vaguely at the well‐known lady—with those strange, half‐classic,
                        half‐Semitic, and yet a little Ethiopian, features, those wide grey eyes,
                        that pent‐roof of crisp, lustreless, black hair, those hollowed cheeks and
                        tragic lips which had by this time become so familiar to the artistic world
                        of London. It never seemed to her that this could have anything to do with
                        her, this sombre, mystic, wistful woman of unreality. But she was not
                        thinking of that; she stood at the picture, but almost without seeing
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin was standing a little aside, looking from her to the picture, and from
                        the picture<pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7108-198"/> to her, and humming the lines
                        from Dante’s sonnet, which Chough had set to music— <q>
                            <l>“Ch’ogni lingua divien tremando muta,</l>
                            <l>Egli occhi non ardiscon di guardare.”</l>
                        </q> “Certainly,” he said to himself, “Dante had not a better Beatrice than
                        this.”</p>
                    <p>“I want to speak to you, Mr Hamlin,” said Anne, suddenly turning round.</p>
                    <p>Something in her voice took him by surprise.</p>
                    <p>“So much the better,” he said, pulling forward a heavy arm‐chair, covered
                        with old‐fashioned green brocade.</p>
                    <p>Anne sat down. How was she to begin? She had intended to prelude with some
                        sort of apology for entering on such a subject; but, somehow, now she could
                        not apologise.</p>
                    <p>“Do you remember a hamlet near Wotton, close by the river, called Cold
                        Fremley?” asked Anne, slowly.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin had just caught a look which he wanted for his picture, and he had
                        taken up his painting things.</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” and he looked up from his palette in<pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7108-199"/>
                        Anne’s pale face, with the almost monochrome faint‐red lips and the
                        delicately hollowed cheeks. “What about it? I remember it quite well. Oh
                        yes, a lovely spot; and we went there one evening together.”</p>
                    <p>“Just so; well, it appears that this hamlet, or rather group of six or seven
                        cabins, belongs to you—is part of the Wotton property.”</p>
                    <p>“Is it? I didn’t know that. Fancy my being the unsuspecting proprietor of
                        such a lovely place! I am so glad; I want to write a poem about it one
                        day.”</p>
                    <p>“And it appears,” went on Anne, carefully steadying her voice, but keeping
                        her eyes on the little cypress‐trees and conventional anemones of the
                        Persian rug under her feet—“it appears that the condition of the people who
                        live in those houses is very, very horrible; the cabins have barely more
                        than one room, into which the whole family is piled.”</p>
                    <p>“Loathsome!” cried Hamlin, with a shudder, “and in such a lovely spot. Do you
                        remember the thick clotted masses of the river dragging<pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7108-200"/> between the meadow‐sweet and willow‐herb?”</p>
                    <p>“It <emph>is</emph> very loathsome,” went on Anne, a coldness coming all over
                        her. “’The people are very wretched, poor, always ill of fever, with no more
                        sense of right and wrong than cattle.”</p>
                    <p>“Very dreadful indeed,” said Hamlin, mixing his paints. “Of course nothing
                        can be done—nothing ever can, you know—”</p>
                    <p>“Something can and must be done!” cried Anne. “It appears that in consequence
                        of this utter wretchedness and ignorance, and especially on account of the
                        degrading effect of being all huddled together, men and women, boys and
                        girls, all of them, in one room which is bedroom, kitchen, sitting‐room,
                        everything at the same time,—it appears that these miserable creatures have
                        gradually come to live worse than animals; they grow, and let their children
                        in turn grow up in horrible, shameful sin.” The difficulty of saying it had
                        vanished; Anne felt that, whether she would<pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7108-201"/> or would not, it must come out. Her voice had kept steady, but died out
                        in terrible hoarseness; and her wide‐opened eyes fixed themselves upon
                        Hamlin.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin let his hand with the palette drop on his knee, and listened with deep
                        attention. “How very strange!” he said; “how very strange—how tragic!”</p>
                    <p>“It <emph>is</emph> tragic,” cried Anne. “Oh, I think nothing in the wide
                        world can be more tragic! What is the murder of the body to this? or what is
                        any crime which one man can commit towards another, compared with men and
                        women being pushed into wickedness by mere external circumstances, being
                        condemned without knowing it, mere blind, indifferent creatures, to befoul
                        their souls in this way?”</p>
                    <p>Anne had not the slightest thought of being eloquent, but she was, not only
                        in her words, but in her face and look. Hamlin appreciated it; he was
                        struck. Such a view of evil and of fate had never presented itself to him;
                        he recognised how much newer and grander it<pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7108-202"/> was than the usual platitude about fatal passion in which he and his
                        school had indulged.</p>
                    <p>“Are you quite sure of this?” he asked, with some interest.</p>
                    <p>“Mrs Collett gave one of the Leighs all the details of it. If you would go to
                        her, she would tell you all about it; she has been afraid, ashamed of
                        mentioning it to you, so I have done it. But if only you would speak to Mrs
                        Collett now, she would explain to you exactly that ought to be done.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin did not seem to attend.</p>
                    <p>“It is awfully grand,” he mused—“all the grander for the utter
                        unconsciousness, involuntariness. It would make a splendid subject for a
                        poem. I always felt there must be something in that county which should
                        correspond to the tragic look of everything. So much Dennistoun’s notion
                        that there isn’t anything poetical or terrible in reality.”</p>
                    <p>A sickening fear came over Anne. But she drove it from her: she tried to say
                        to <choice>
                            <orig>her‐<pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7108-203"/> self</orig>
                            <reg>herself</reg>
                        </choice> that she had expected this; that Hamlin, being unaccustomed to any
                        serious thought of the evil of others, and being a poet, would at first take
                        things in this way.</p>
                    <p>“Mrs Collett says that there is hope of saving these miserable creatures by
                        building better dwellings for them; trying to turn Cold Fremley into a
                        village, and setting up a school. I have been thinking over it a great deal
                        myself. Of course I’m very ignorant. But I’ve heard that the river ought to
                        be valuable for water‐power, because there is no other one near; so I
                        thought the simplest would be to try and induce some one—or do it
                        yourself—to set up a factory there. That would give the people work, and
                        give them ideas of decent living, and then a school would have to be
                        opened.”</p>
                    <p>The word <emph>factory</emph> seemed to sear into Hamlin’s nerves.</p>
                    <p>“A factory on that river? on my property? to befoul all that pure and
                        exquisite country with smoke and machine refuse!” he cried indignantly.</p>
                    <pb n="206" xml:id="VAB7108-204"/>
                    <p>“One single factory need not befoul anything,” said Anne, sternly. “And all
                        the smoke and machine refuse in the wide world could not make that
                        neighbourhood one‐hundredth part as foul as it is made by the sin of Cold
                        Fremley. No, not one‐thousandth part as foul as our own hearts, if we let
                        such an evil exist under our eyes.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin seemed moved and puzzled.</p>
                    <p>“It <emph>is</emph> very dreadful,” he mused. “I really had no notion that
                        such things go on nowadays. One is apt to think the world much more
                        commonplace than it is. I will go to Cold Fremley some day soon. I’ll take
                        Lewis with me, he’ll be very much interested in it. I daresay,” he added,
                        “that there’s a great deal of exaggeration about it. But as to the factory,
                        I consider it would be against my conscience to permit such a thing: there
                        is no greater pollution in England than factories; thank Heaven, there are
                        as yet few in our county; and I would rather die than spoil that beautiful
                        peaceful bit of ground.”</p>
                    <pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7108-205"/>
                    <p>Against this Anne felt it useless to struggle.</p>
                    <p>“Since you will not hear of the only plan which would easily improve the
                        condition of those people,” she went on, “let us leave the factory alone; it
                        is not necessary: a few hundred pounds will amply pay for improving,
                        enlarging the six or seven houses of which Cold Fremley consists. As to
                        draining, every one says that were that county drained, it would amply repay
                        the expense by the superior quality of the crops. All that is wanted for the
                        present,” invocated Anne in despair, “is that the people should have more
                        room—that they should not herd like cattle—that the growing children, at
                        least, should not be forced into contact with all that vice. And all that
                        can be gained by merely enlarging the cottages.”</p>
                    <p>“Such a thing as you suggest would—besides being, in my opinion, perfectly
                        useless—involve a very heavy expense,” answered Hamlin, coldly.</p>
                    <p>“Not more,” cried Anne, blazing up—“not<pb n="208" xml:id="VAB7108-206"/>
                        more than you have been at in educating me, Mr Hamlin!”</p>
                    <p>The words were scarcely out of her mouth when she repented of them.</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps,” she added sullenly, “that also has been a waste.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin did not answer; he was taken by surprise, embarrassed.</p>
                    <p>“The cases are wholly dissimilar. The left hand may not ask the right hand
                        what it has or has not been able to do.”</p>
                    <p>“What do you mean, Mr Hamlin? If you have been spending more than you can
                        afford on me—oh, don’t think I’m not grateful—but please, please, spend no
                        more. This house might be sold. You don’t live in it after all, and Aunt
                        Claudia would be just as happy at Wotton. The house and furniture must be
                        worth a good deal, and then there is the expense of housekeeping in London.
                        Do think of it. I am sure you could raise money enough in that way.”</p>
                    <p>“This house is not mine, Miss Brown,”<pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7108-207"/>
                        answered Hamlin, quietly; “it was bought out of your capital; and the
                        expenses you mention are paid out of your income, not mine.”</p>
                    <p>He had wasted all this on her, and the people on his estate lived in foul,
                        sinful hovels! A strange gratitude, mixed with horror, overcame Anne; all
                        the beautiful things about her,—her beautiful fantastic dress, which Hamlin
                        always designed for her, her knowledge and good‐breeding,—all that had been
                        paid for with that money, became loathsome to her.</p>
                    <p>“It is not mine—not mine; I am a mere beggar living off your charity,” she
                        exclaimed—“living off what I have no right to, what ought to go to
                            <emph>them</emph>—to those poor sinful creatures at Cold Fremley. Oh, Mr
                        Hamlin, sell this house, sell the furniture, all, all. Enough has been done
                        for me; I don’t want all these beautiful things in order to be happy; I
                        could be happy anywhere, doing anything, if I knew that there was one evil
                        the less in the world. If there did not remain enough to live upon, I could
                        go out as a governess, or a<pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7108-208"/>
                        schoolmistress. I have learned quite enough to do that—indeed I am in
                        earnest—I should be perfectly happy gaining my bread as I used to. Only let
                        something be done for those people—don’t let me feel that every lovely thing
                        I look at, every beautiful thing I hear, every word you say, every pleasure
                        I feel, is as sinful as those sinful lives!”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin smiled; he admired and disbelieved; but what a magnificent woman she
                        was! what passion, what fervour under that cold exterior!</p>
                    <p>“There is no need for that,” he said gently, looking at Anne with admiring
                        and loving eyes. “I am not so poor as that, and I would starve rather than
                        see you deprived of any single thing to which you have a right.”</p>
                    <p>“Then you will go to Cold Fremley? You will see about it?” He was good and
                        generous at bottom—she knew it; and she could have fallen on her knees and
                        cried like a child with her head upon his arm.</p>
                    <p>“I will go to Cold Fremley,” he answered<pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7108-209"/>
                        with alacrity. “I want to go there. I want to study the whole matter—”</p>
                    <p>“What do you want to study it for?” asked Anne, suddenly and terribly; “to
                        improve matters, or—to write a poem?”</p>
                    <p>“I do wish to write a poem,” answered Hamlin, who felt no shame for doing so,
                        and resented being thus reproved. “Certainly I wish to write a poem. You
                        made such a fuss about my tearing up that ‘Ballad of the Fens’—well, I now
                        see my way to making use of all the best parts of it, and with a real tragic
                        and passionate motive. As to improving matters, I will look about me. But I
                        totally disbelieve in the utility of giving these people better dwellings.
                        Of course,” he went on gently, but with that tone of knowledge of the evil
                        of the world which Anne so much hated—“of course <emph>you</emph>, who are
                        pure and upright, who cannot conceive the reality of lust and the
                        fascination of evil—<emph>you</emph> can never understand the hold which
                        evil has in this world; you cannot understand that the passion for sin
                            may<pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7108-210"/> exist as there exists in you the
                        passion for good; that most men receive in their father’s blood, in their
                        mother’s milk, the haschisch of sinful desire,—that the more they grow, the
                        more it grows in them—that it is their very life, and is perpetually seeking
                        for aliment. Evil is; it cannot be stamped out.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin’s eyes sparkled, and he spoke with a flush; but there was no
                        excitement, no horror in his tone. Anne felt that he was reciting in prose
                        what he would soon write in verse.</p>
                    <p>“In short,” she said, “you think the sinfulness of the people of Cold Fremley
                        fits very well into the landscape? You think it, as you said, very
                        picturesque and grand?”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin was a man who could not easily keep at high moral tension.</p>
                    <p>“Well, yes,” he answered; “of course it <emph>is</emph> very shocking, and if
                        anything could be done, why, I should be glad. But I <emph>know</emph>
                        nothing can be done; and although it is very much to be regretted, yet I
                        don’t think you can deny<pb n="213" xml:id="VAB7108-211"/> that there is
                        something very grand and tragic in this sin flowering like evil grasses in
                        that marsh.”</p>
                    <p>“I see,” said Anne, faintly—everything seemed to be turning all round her;
                        “good‐bye.”</p>
                    <p>“You mustn’t be angry with me,” said Hamlin, following her to the studio
                        door. “You see I, unfortunately, have much more experience of life and evil
                        than you will ever have. I know that fatality of sin; and that makes me take
                        things in a different way from how you take them.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin’s voice sounded faint and distant to Anne, hollow like an echo in a
                        whispering chamber. She went mechanically up‐stairs; she did not know how
                        she felt, but everything seemed surrounded by thick, clammy horror; the
                        world was going to pieces. When she had shut the door of her room behind
                        her, she threw herself with her face on her bed, and burst into an agony of
                        half‐audible sobs. But when at length hours passed, and the maid<pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7108-212"/> came to ask whether she would come to tea, Anne
                        felt no better; a black despair weighed upon her. On her dressing‐table
                        stood a Japanese jar, filled with delicate autumnal roses; they had the
                        pallor, the diaphanous purity which the frost gives to flowers, as
                        approaching death gives it sometimes to human creatures. Anne looked at
                        them; and then, without passion or excitement, she took them out of the
                        vase, and threw them into the fire. She watched the petals shrivel and fall
                        to black dust on the flame, and the leaves and stalks turn slowly, with a
                        hissing noise, into glowing embers. Then she felt ashamed. The poor flowers
                        were pure—they at least were clean—and she had destroyed them. And Anne
                        buried her head in her hands, and began to sob once more.</p>

                    <p><hi>THE</hi> Leigh girls never discovered which of them was in the right; and
                        as Anne never made any further allusion to Cold Fremley, they concluded that
                        she had not spoken to Hamlin about it. Hamlin noticed no change in her, but
                        then he never expected to see one: Anne became gradually more silent, more
                        indifferent, more abrupt in her answers. Some people said, “She is getting
                        spoilt by being made too much of;” and others, like Thaddy O’Reilly, hinted
                        that the vagaries and splendours of æsthetic society, the poems and music
                        and improprieties of Chough and Dennistoun, the nudities and Elizabethan
                        dramatists of Lewis, were beginning to pall upon Miss Brown. “I’ll bet
                        anything,” said Thaddy<pb n="216" xml:id="VAB7108-214"/> O’Reilly, “that as
                        soon as they are married, the new Mrs Hamlin will abandon Mantegnesque
                        costumes, will open a bill with Worth, and insist upon hiring a house in
                        Belgravia for at least one season.” So said Thaddy O’Reilly; but it must be
                        added that he said it to Mrs Spencer, to alarm and anger whose hereditary
                        high‐art passions was the little journalist’s great delight. Anne still went
                        out into æsthetic society, she still listened to new poems and to literary
                        discussions, she still sat to Hamlin and to half‐a‐dozen other painters; but
                        when people at concerts or the play used to point out Miss Brown as the
                        queen of æstheticism, they little guessed how far removed were the thoughts
                        of this queen from her realm and her subjects. Ever since that memorable
                        conversation about Cold Fremley, beautiful things,—all the things—poetry,
                        painting, music, romance—which had originally surrounded Hamlin with a sort
                        of luminous emanation in Anne’s eyes,—had grown loathsome to her. She knew
                        that it was unfair<pb n="217" xml:id="VAB7108-215"/> and absurd, but she
                        could not resist the feeling that all the fair forms and sound patterns and
                        imaginary passions of poetry—nay, that the very beauty of nature, where any
                        existed—were foul; and her soul shrank from them as from contamination. She
                        began to take a grim pleasure in that sordid ugliness which had, on her
                        arrival in London, given her such a shock, and to which Hamlin and his
                        friends were always shutting their eyes. The fog, the black ooze, the
                        melancholy monotony of griminess, the hideousness of the men and women in
                        the streets, jarred upon her much less than the beautiful pictures of
                        Italian scenery which Hamlin hung up at Hammersmith,—than the lovely,
                        mysterious creatures in jewel‐coloured robes, wandering in distant countries
                        of bliss and romance, which Hamlin painted. The poetry of pure beauty
                        sickened her; and she could not take up even the purest poems of that
                        school, not even the mere charming pieces of decoration of Morris, without
                        putting them down with disgust. She began to feel a vague<pb n="218" xml:id="VAB7108-216"/> nostalgic longing after her own past: faint
                        recollections of her father’s grimy, workshop at Spezia, of the poor little
                        room where her mother had sat doing cheap dressmaking, returned to her. The
                        life at Florence, the sordid life with the Perrys, the tattered furniture
                        and ill‐swept rooms, the dirty and noisy kitchen with the haunting smell of
                        sink; the dull routine of washing and ironing and mending, of dressing and
                        undressing the refractory children, of teaching them their letters and
                        trying to keep them tidy; the ill‐will, the muttered anger, the jeering
                        scraps of song of the other servants, who resented Anne’s superiority,—all
                        these recollections which had almost been effaced during her happy new life
                        at Coblenz and in London, returned to her, vivid as reality, and filled her
                        with unaccountable yearning. And yet, when she asked herself what this
                        meant, she could not but confess that she was different from what she had
                        then been; that she had absorbed too much of the new life ever to be happy
                        in the<pb n="219" xml:id="VAB7108-217"/> old one—nay, that that very
                        indignation with the mere selfish worship of beauty which made all things
                        seem black in her eyes, would never have been possible had she remained a
                        mere servant. Hamlin had redeemed her soul; he had made her a thinking and
                        feeling being—but what for? She dared not admit to herself that it was
                        merely in order that she should despise him.</p>
                    <p>But Anne pushed aside these thoughts. She felt that she had no right to
                        indulge in them—that she must give her mind to other things, her heart and
                        her energy. Without exactly knowing what she could do, or even whether she
                        could do anything at all, she felt that she must work—work with all her
                        might; for it seemed as if all the thoughts which the people about her
                        refused to think, all the sympathy which they refused to feel, all the work
                        which they refused to do, and all the sacrifices which they refused to make,
                        must all be taken upon herself—as if she alone must bear this terrible
                        weight of rejected responsibilities. So Anne<pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7108-218"/> worked. Her cousin Dick had said that no one could do any good in
                        ignorance; and she felt herself shamefully ignorant of all but useless
                        things. She got together a whole heap of books and pamphlets on every
                        possible kind of grievance and evil in the world; she made Marjory Leigh
                        tell her all the dreadful things which she knew, show her all the dreadful
                        things which she had seen. Of such things Marjory and her young man, the
                        East End curate, could tell her but too many; yet Anne was not satisfied.
                        She sought the acquaintance of Marjory’s colleagues in the work of helping
                        the poor, and of Harry Collett’s fellow‐workers—older men and women, whose
                        account of the evil of the world, less exaggerated and poetical than
                        Marjory’s and Harry’s, was still more grimly tragic. They were hopeful
                        nevertheless; but Anne, returning home from her attendance on lectures, her
                        ghastly rounds in the slums,—home to the lovely house, with the Persian
                        carpets, the 18th‐century hangings and furniture, the old majolica and
                            Japanese<pb n="221" xml:id="VAB7108-219"/> ware, the flowers and the
                        books of music,—returning home to the discussions on art and literature in
                        Hamlin’s studio and at her own dinner‐table,—Anne felt mere despair. For, it
                        must be remembered, Anne had none of those consoling thoughts to fall back
                        upon which religion, however conventional, affords. Her father, a Radical
                        workman of the French school, had brought her up with a few elementary ideas
                        of right and wrong, and the faith that all priests, like all kings, were the
                        curse of the world. Miss Curzon, the kind‐hearted old <foreign xml:lang="ita">prima donna</foreign> who had taken charge of her in her
                        earliest girlhood, had given her examples of only the most frivolous
                        Voltairianism; from the servants and the Italians who surrounded her at the
                        Perrys, she had learned only a contempt for the conscienceless mummeries of
                        the lowest Catholicism; from Mrs Perry only a contempt, as great in its way,
                        for the heartless conventionalism of mere social Protestantism; and from
                        Hamlin himself, and Hamlin’s friends (for at Coblenz he had <choice>
                            <orig>stip‐<pb n="222" xml:id="VAB7108-220"/> ulated</orig>
                            <reg>stipulated</reg>
                        </choice> that Miss Brown was not to be <emph>bored with religion</emph>),
                        she had heard only of the religion of beauty. Of the men and women who used
                        to come to Hammersmith and to Wotton, some, like Chough, professed
                        Catholicism, and wrote mystical rhapsodies to the Virgin Mary; others, like
                        Dennistoun, called the Virgin a prostitute, and God a highway murderer: some
                        went in for imitating the <foreign xml:lang="fre">näiveté</foreign> of
                        medieval Christianity; yet others filled their books with hymns to the gods,
                        clean and foul, of paganism. There was a deal of vociferating on the
                        subject; a deal of abusive language both of the religious and the
                        irreligious; a deal of exhortation on the part of men like Hamlin not to
                        have the bad taste to muddle religion with poetry; and on the whole, there
                        was an atmosphere of absolute insincerity, in which, as in abstract politics
                        (for certain æsthetes were extreme retrogrades, and loathed civilisation;
                        while others would pour out by the hour revolutionary tirades of the most
                        blood‐thirsty description), it appeared that religion<pb n="223" xml:id="VAB7108-221"/> was a mere personal hobby or poetical fiction:
                        the usual conclusion being simply that the world was too disgusting a place
                        for a well‐constituted soul; that the century was empty, and heartless, and
                        emasculate; and that, as the people in the ‘Decameron’ fled from the plague,
                        and told stories and sang songs in a pleasant villa all by themselves, so
                        also must superior men and women fly from the sordidness, the
                        uninterestingness, the mediocrity, and incapacity for passion of reality,
                        and entertain one another with tales of romance and wonder in a fairy land,
                        where the sole divinity was beauty, and where alone, among the lovely and
                        noble things left by the past, noble natures could develop uncramped,
                        according to the ideal of the Greeks, of medieval men, or of that most
                        elevated genius, the late Théophile Gautier.</p>
                    <p>To meet the terrible realities which were now being revealed to her, to
                        answer her own painful craving after usefulness, Anne had therefore only a
                        vain negative belief—the pessimism which<pb n="224" xml:id="VAB7108-222"/>
                        is at the bottom of all æstheticism, the belief in the fatal supremacy of
                        evil and ugliness. But in Anne this purely negative creed speedily became
                        positive; pessimism produced not a desire to abandon the odious reality and
                        take refuge in mere imaginary happiness, but a frightful moral tension, a
                        constant battle of her aspirations with her belief, of her conscience with
                        her reason, a strain of rebellion against the inevitable. So, to the weight
                        of the knowledge of evil, to the weight of the consciousness of the deadness
                        of soul which surrounded her, was added in Anne the terrible sense of the
                        injustice and callousness of nature and of fate, of the groundlessness of
                        those instincts of good which left her no peace.</p>
                    <p>But all this no one ever guessed. She despised indulging her own
                        wretchedness. She went on, behaving as usual, goading herself to practical
                        concerns silently, letting no one know of her misery, letting no thought of
                        it waste a moment of her time. Her longing was to break the hateful
                        solidarity between<pb n="225" xml:id="VAB7108-223"/> herself and the school
                        of æsthetic indifferentism; her instinct was, since she (dependent as she
                        felt herself on a man’s charity) could not practically help others, at least
                        to understand and feel about all these subjects which Hamlin and his friends
                        tabooed. And with this haunting desire, she turned not merely to Marjory Lee
                        and Harry Collett, but instinctively also to her cousin Dick.</p>
                    <p>“I have read the books you lent me to take into the country,” she said,
                        giving him back the various primers and pamphlets on economical subjects.
                        “Thank you so much for them, Dick.”</p>
                    <p>They were sitting alone in the drawing‐room at Hammersmith. Richard Brown had
                        called only once before, ceremoniously and briefly, and he would not have
                        come this time either, if Anne had not written expressly to beg him to fetch
                        back the books. He looked at her in his incredulous, contemptuous way.</p>
                    <p>“Really,” he said, “my shabby old books are very much flattered by having
                        been <choice>

                        </choice> to sojourn so long among such an assemblage of lovely things;” and
                        he looked round the room at the pieces of embroidery and the Eastern
                        carpets, the pictures and drawings, the quantities of Japanese porcelain and
                        lacquer all round. “How much out of place they do look, and how queer they
                        must have felt among their companions! Let me see: two volumes on artistic
                        furniture—‘Ballads of Old France’—‘Rossetti’—‘Contes de Gautier.’ I
                        see—”</p>
                    <p>“Those are Mr Hamlin’s books,” said Anne, quickly; “he must have taken them
                        out of the library, or brought them up from the studio. I am not reading any
                        of them.”</p>
                    <p>“You are reading nothing but sociology and political economy; I understand,”
                        went on Brown, with his placid sneer, which seemed, in this frightfully
                        masculine man, to condemn in Anne her mind, her person, her manner, her
                        character, and even her sex. “Ah, well, I can understand that; it must be
                        refreshing. Who is it—Mr Pater, or some such great gun of yours—who says
                        that the object of the wise<pb n="227" xml:id="VAB7108-225"/> man is to make
                        his life consist in as many moments of thrilling impressions as possible;
                        that the very wise people get them out of art and song, and the less wise
                        out of vice or out of philanthropy? You must know the passage better than I.
                        Well, I suppose you have got as many impressions out of art and song as
                        possible, and (being far too delicate in taste to try vice) you are seeing
                        what can be got out of philanthropy. Is that it?”</p>
                    <p>Anne frowned.</p>
                    <p>“Of course,” she said, “you think it very clever to snub me, Dick, and very
                        manly; just to treat me as if I could not possibly have either heart or
                        brains. Maybe; but it is a very cheap sort of sarcasm, and to make which a
                        man like you is not at all required.”</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown bit his black beard, and looked at Anne from beneath his beetle
                        brows; he threw himself a little back on his chair, and with his head on one
                        side, he said, with affected indifference—</p>
                    <p>“You don’t mean to tell me that you<pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7108-226"/> have
                        read those books except as you would read—what shall I say?—the ‘History of
                        Furniture,’ or the ‘Contes de Gautier,’ Anne?”</p>
                    <p>“Were you ever ignorant about important vital subjects, Richard—ever
                        conscious that it was your duty as a rational creature to know something
                        about them, and then snubbed by a man who knew all about them, and to whom
                        you had applied to help you?”</p>
                    <p>Brown was silent for a moment.</p>
                    <p>“I was a poor lad, working in a factory, and refusing myself food and coals
                        in order to buy books and papers”—he said crushingly—“and I never had an
                        opportunity of asking any one’s assistance.”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t see why there should be salvation only for people who have gone
                        through hardships, nor why only you and those who have acted like you should
                        be treated sincerely and seriously. Do you think that because I am a woman
                        who has been brought up among Persian rugs and Japanese pots and Burne
                        Jones’s pictures,—because I have gone to <choice>

                        I may not therefore be as honestly anxious to know about the serious things
                        of the world as you were when you worked in a factory, and went without
                        dinner and without coals?” and she fixed her eyes on her cousin’s ugly and
                        powerful face, in which, for all its ugliness, one might have fancied one
                        saw something not wholly unlike that magnificent sibyl‐like face which
                        pre‐Raphaelite artists had immortalised and caricatured. “Seriously, and in
                        your heart,” she went on, as Brown made no reply, “are you unable to
                        understand that perhaps it may require more real determination to try and
                        learn such things when one is brought up in luxury in an æsthetic house,
                        than when one has to buy books at the price of food and fire?”</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown did not answer. He was a frank man, and he frankly faced Anne’s
                        look, and in return looked long and searchingly at her; and as the habitual
                        look of bantering contempt had given way to a serious scrutiny,<pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7108-228"/> so now he gradually grew more gentle and
                        earnest.</p>
                    <p>“Forgive me, Anne,” he said, after a moment; “I think I may have been doing
                        you injustice, and that I may, to some degree, have been disgracing myself.
                        But, you see, I am a plain self‐made man, and it is difficult for me to
                        understand how . . .”</p>
                    <p>Brown rarely hesitated for the end of his sentence, but this time he did.</p>
                    <p>“To understand how there can be any conscience or seriousness in a woman who
                        has been willing to owe everything to the generosity of an æsthete like Mr
                        Hamlin”—Anne finished his sentence bitterly. She went on—“Well, I know you
                        could not believe that an æsthete could be generous and noble and
                        chivalrous; and now you cannot understand how a woman who has accepted his
                        generosity can be anything better than—than a piece artistic embroidery, or
                        a Japanese cup, or a green tree,” and Anne pulled the long pliable leaves of
                        a palm passionately through her fingers.</p>
                    <pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7108-229"/>
                    <p>Brown’s suspiciousness had tried to return; but it was routed by Anne’s firm
                        look, by Anne’s frank words.</p>
                    <p>“It is terrible to think how prejudiced, how inaccessible to truth, one
                        allows one’s self to become,” answered Brown, “even though, Heaven knows,
                        one tries to be fair. What you say is true. I couldn’t understand your not
                        being a mere frivolous girl, Anne; and I can’t well understand it yet. But
                        what you tell me I will believe.”</p>
                    <p>“Thank you, Dick,” said Anne, stretching out her hand. “I don’t think we are
                        made to like each other much: you are too prejudiced, and haughty, and
                        contemptuous; and I am too proud and too stiff‐necked. But we are both
                        honest, so we might as well deal honestly and openly with each other, and
                        try and understand each other’s good points.”</p>
                    <p>“I am not accustomed to deal with semi‐professional beauties, to do the
                        Petrarch to æsthetic <foreign xml:lang="ita">Madonna mias</foreign>,” said
                        Brown—that sneer of conscious masculinity and conscious<pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7108-230"/> self‐madeness coming over him again; “you must
                        excuse my manner, Anne.” But he met Anne’s glance, and his tone changed once
                        more.</p>
                    <p>“I will bring you some more books when I return,” he said. “By the way, have
                        you ever read any psychology?”</p>
                    <p>“What is psychology? Is it metaphysics? I have read Hegel—” Anne stopped
                        short, and then boldly added—</p>
                    <p>“ But it was only Hegel’s æsthetics, you know.”</p>
                    <p>Brown smiled. “Hegel’s æsthetics are not—well—not Posthlethwaite’s
                        æsthetics,” he said; “this is not much more difficult. It is Spencer’s
                        sociology. I will bring it you. Good‐bye.”</p>
                    <p>After that visit, Anne began to see more of her cousin. He came sometimes to
                        Hammersmith, and he met her frequently at the Leighs. Anne did not feel that
                        she completely liked him. He was pure‐minded, certainly, and generous, a man
                        devoted to progress even in<pb n="233" xml:id="VAB7108-231"/> its humblest
                        forms; he had a powerful intellect and a more powerful will. But, somehow,
                        there was in him an indefinable coarseness of fibre, a want of appreciation,
                        of sympathy with other people’s ideals, a tendency to despise all those
                        around him, and to see meanness in all those who were not in the same
                        position, or who had not the same views and aims as himself; above all, an
                        unconscious desire to domineer—a brutal, almost animal wish for supremacy,
                        which his knowledge of his own purity and rectitude and self‐sacrificing
                        power made him accept and cherish as if it were a kind of holy spirit
                        dwelling within himself, and not merely the product of a brutal temperament,
                        which a noble intellect and a generous heart had severed from all brutish
                        interests, but which remained brutal none the less. Anne’s pride, her
                        consciousness of finer fibre than her cousin’s, made her shrink from seeking
                        in Richard Brown for assistance in her arduous task of freeing her spirit
                        from the slough of æsthetic selfishness; his suspiciousness of her motives,
                        his sarcasms,<pb n="234" xml:id="VAB7108-232"/> his blindness to her purity
                        of impulse, all this galled her; but she submitted to be galled. She wished
                        her soul at least to be free, though her body might remain, as it were, in
                        bondage, and Richard stood at the door of that world of nobler endeavour
                        which she longed to enter; moreover, her stern spirit made her take a sort
                        of pleasure in the very bitterness which she had to taste. If Richard had
                        been sympathising, if he had met her half‐way and tried to help her on, she
                        would have felt that she was bound to him, that she was battering her
                        liberty once more; and vaguely Anne knew that she must never be bound to any
                        one save Hamlin—that little as he could understand her, she was obliged, for
                        ever, to try and understand him. And sometimes even, though the sense of
                        Hamlin’s baseness, of his selfish æstheticism and his untruthful morbidness,
                        weighed more upon her day by day, Anne would elaborately go over all that he
                        had been to her—nay, all that, to the best of his power, he still was: she
                        would sit for hours reading<pb n="235" xml:id="VAB7108-233"/> and re‐reading
                        those treasured‐up letters whose arrival had made her so strangely happy at
                        Coblenz; (how long, long ago it seemed, and how little that schoolgirl
                        seemed to share of her identity!) and Anne, reading over those letters,
                        carefully collecting together all the stances of Hamlin’s generosity and
                        delicacy and gentleness which she could remember—nay, mere looks and tones
                        which had brought home formerly her love for him—made up out of them a
                        simulacrum of Hamlin, and persuaded herself that she loved it, and that it
                        was Hamlin’s real reality, the reality which had become spoilt by the
                        horrible moral atmosphere, distorted, warped, but a reality nevertheless.
                        Nay, sometimes the sense of Hamlin’s weakness would come home to her, and
                        with a pang make her feel how much she was bound to suffer, how much she was
                        bound to do for him.</p>

                    <p><hi>HAMLIN</hi> had forgotten all about the business of Cold Fremley, except
                        that he had stopped the printing of his book, and set to work remodelling
                        the “Ballad of the Fens,” to the immense admiration of Chough and
                        Dennistoun, who were quite reconciled to realism now that it was allied with
                        horrid sin. But that Anne was at all alienated from him, never once entered
                        his mind. He noticed, indeed, that Anne had grown much more serious of late,
                        that she seemed less happy than some months before; but for that he had his
                        explanation. He believed that her character was suddenly maturing (for he
                        never guessed that Anne’s nature was one of those which mature rapidly, and
                        whose maturity means<pb n="237" xml:id="VAB7108-235"/> responsibility), and
                        that there was brewing beneath that sombre exterior a storm of passion of
                        which he was the object. That such a storm would come had been his
                        persuasion from the very beginning of his acquaintance with Anne; he had
                        guessed in her some strange latent force, and to see it develop had been his
                        wish. That long courtship, that purely Platonic familiarity, giving scope to
                        so much poetic devotion, poetic gratitude, was always to end, in Hamlin’s
                        expectation, with a sudden burst of passion, which should envelop him, give
                        his cold nature the exquisite sensation of being fired, carried off by a
                        more powerful temperament than his own. Hamlin had had many love‐affairs in
                        his day, more or less pure or base; he had, once or twice, been mastered by
                        the stronger nature of a woman, but that had been mere brute passion, and
                        what he desired was to rouse a passion terrifically overwhelming, but pure,
                        intellectual, and with all the fearful violence of merely intellectual
                        passions: a passion like<pb n="238" xml:id="VAB7108-236"/> that, which he
                        always admired more than any other in literature, of Heathcliff for
                        Catharine in ‘Wuthering Heights,’—a passion such as some men have felt for a
                        dead woman. This he had always hoped from Anne, and in the expectation of
                        this he had been confirmed by every new revelation of her character.
                        Sometimes, when Anne sat listless in the midst of their guests, her mind for
                        away, her tragic face more sombre for the blackness that was in the world
                        around her and in her own soul, Hamlin would watch her, and feel, with a
                        pang of satisfaction, that he had not been mistaken in her.</p>
                    <p>“She is not a woman, she is a mere splendid statue!” Lewis had once exclaimed
                        angrily, as he felt how utterly all that kind of occult sensual fascination,
                        which his pale mysterious face, his vermilion lips, his cat‐like green eyes,
                        his low droning voice, his sultan‐like freedom of manner, his sense of
                        omniscience and omnipotence, his own nature, strangely compounded of the
                        beast and of<pb n="239" xml:id="VAB7108-237"/> the dreamer, indubitably
                        exercised over many women, how utterly it trickled off Anne—</p>
                    <p>“She is not a woman, Hamlin,—she has an intellect and a will, but she has no
                        soul; and one day you will discover it.”</p>
                    <p>“She is not a woman in the sense in which you conceive a woman,” answered
                        Hamlin, contemptuously; “and she is as incapable of what you and most of us
                        call passion, as is a statue. She has not one fibre of what you could call
                        womanhood in her—not one shred of the beast which lies at the bottom of all
                        our natures has entered into hers; she is a woman of mere stone and ice and
                        snow for men like you. But just for that reason has she got a capacity for
                        passion—for a passion which you can never understand—such as no other woman
                        ever had. What are all those precious women—Cleopatras and Mary Stuarts—call
                        them whatever you like, whom we think so poetical? Mere common harlots,
                        decked out in poetical gewgaws, at bottom nothing better than a Madame
                        Bovary, not so much as a Manon <choice>

                        </choice>. Mere filthy clay shaped into something comely. What is it to be
                        loved by one of them? You might as well be loved by a barmaid.”</p>
                    <p>Edmund Lewis’s lip curled.</p>
                    <p>“Certainly Miss Brown suits you in your present mood, Walter; I don’t say
                        not. But you will find out later what it is to be in love with a woman who
                        is stone and ice and snow for men like me. Madonna Laura and Beatrice are
                        all very fine; but your ideal lady, I repeat it, is no woman at all, but a
                        mere sexless creature, something like Victor Hugo’s handsome Enjolras in
                        petticoats. Passion for humanity, for fame, for abstract excellence‐oh, as
                        much of that as you like; but passion for so humble a thing as a living man!
                        Never!”</p>
                    <p>“Please leave the subject alone, Lewis,” said Hamlin. “I don’t care to have
                        slugs creeping, even only in imagination, over my lilies. Talk about
                            <emph>your</emph> women, other men’s women, as much as you choose, but
                        spare me your remarks about Miss Brown.”</p>
                    <p>Chough had been listening. The excitable<pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7108-239"/>
                        little poet of womanhood detested Lewis, whose arrogance grated upon him,
                        and whose impurity of nature unconsciously offended the real innocence which
                        underlay all his grandiloquently improper verses. And Chough adored Anne;
                        she was, he often said, a quite new revelation of womanhood; and he believed
                        that, as passion was the one noble thing in the world, and as Miss Brown was
                        the noblest woman that had ever lived, that there must be a deal of passion
                        in Anne.</p>
                    <p>“There is passion of all sorts,” said Chough, pulling his long black
                        whiskers; “the passion of the pure animal, the passion of the mere human
                        creature, and the passion of divine essences: the first is like a lush
                        tropical country; the second is like the manifold sea; the third is like the
                        high Alps, the highest strata of air, the purest light. The passion of
                        divine essences is more terrible than any other, exactly because of its
                        external nature: it is tragic. Miss Brown has that sort of passion—”</p>
                    <pb n="242" xml:id="VAB7108-240"/>
                    <p>“Idiot,” muttered Hamlin ; and yet he felt pleased at Chough’s mystical
                        corroboration of his ideas.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile there was one subject upon which Anne sympathised warmly with
                        Hamlin, and that was his cousin Sacha. For all her evident theatricalness,
                        Anne warmed towards Madame Elaguine. She saw in her something frank and
                        fearless which appealed to her, and a pathetic helpless desire, as of a
                        child which has been naughty but wants to learn how to be good, to retrieve
                        her own wasted life, to save her children from what she had undergone
                        herself; above all, a wish to be in earnest without well knowing how to, a
                        strain to be a serious woman in the midst of the habits of a spoilt child
                        and of a flirt. For a spoilt child, unaccustomed to self‐control, impatient
                        of small sacrifices, avid of excitement and novelty, avid of constant
                        attention and admiration, Madame Elaguine certainly was; and a flirt as
                        certainly also. She flirted with every one, with Hamlin, with as many of
                            his<pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7108-241"/> friends—Chough, Lewis, and
                        Dennistoun—as he took to her; with Anne, with the Leigh girls, with the
                        solemn schoolmasters and schoolmistresses, whom she interviewed for the
                        benefit of her children; she flirted—you saw it by her smile and her little
                        childish laugh of recognition—with the very housemaid who opened the door;
                        she flirted with every man, woman, and child, with every dog or cat that she
                        came across.</p>
                    <p>“What a flirt that woman is, to be sure!” cried Hamlin, as he saw every one
                        of his and Anne’s friends subjugated in an hour’s visit by Madame Elaguine.
                        And to be a flirt was no recommendation to Hamlin; he wanted to absorb all
                        admiration, he wanted to inspire love; flirts were his particular
                        aversion.</p>
                    <p>“What harm does her flirting do?” answered Anne; “it merely makes her and
                        those about her a little happier.”</p>
                    <p>“I thought you cared only for serious, for intense people, Miss Brown—you who
                        are so serious and intense yourself.”</p>
                    <pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7108-242"/>
                    <p>“Perhaps I am too serious”—and poor Anne felt at the moment that she
                        certainly was too serious to be very happy; “but, however that may be, that
                        is no reason why your cousin should not be a flirt. As long as a person can
                        feel strongly and seriously on serious subjects, why quarrel with him or her
                        for being childish about childish matters?”</p>
                    <p>For experience had taught Anne the bitter truth that people could be
                        serious—heaven knows how serious!—like the odious Lewis and like Hamlin
                        himself, and yet have no fibre of sympathy or indignation; and her
                        experience of flippant little Chough, with his tenderly cared for wife—of
                        flirtatious Marjory Leigh and her humanitarian labours—had made her hope
                        most from the very people whose light nature she, so earnest and tragic,
                        could understand least. And to this category she added Madame Elaguine.</p>
                    <p>“Your cousin has strong sides to her nature, I am quite persuaded,” she
                        said.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin shrugged his shoulders; but <choice>
                            <orig>never‐<pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7108-243"/> theless</orig>
                            <reg>nevertheless</reg>
                        </choice>, though he highly resented Madame Elaguine’s all‐round
                        flirtatiousness, he was forced to admit to himself that the little woman
                        had, when you were in her presence, a sort of magnetic fascination.</p>
                    <p>What moved Anne was Madame Elaguine’s vehement passion for her children, the
                        long schemes which, to Hamlin’s <foreign xml:lang="fre">ennui</foreign>, she
                        would enthusiastically dilate upon for their future; and somehow, from words
                        which she used to drop, it would seem that she had been in danger of losing
                        those children—that she was still exposed to having them taken from her, or
                        to being in some way separated from them. Anne did not absolutely formulate
                        to herself a hope of helping Madame Elaguine; but she felt vaguely that
                        perhaps she, with her seriousness and determination, might help the
                        excitable and decidedly vague‐minded little woman to persist in and carry
                        out her ideas; that here she had at last a chance of being useful. The first
                        thing, Anne felt, was to bridge over the gulf of past animosity which still
                            separated<pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7108-244"/> Hamlin from his cousin—to
                        take away from Sacha Elaguine the demoralising sense of being an only
                        half‐forgiven intruder. The great difficulty was Mrs Macgregor. The old lady
                        could not abate one tittle of her hatred for the Sacha of former days.</p>
                    <p>“I tell you she is a bad woman, and you will find it out some day to your
                        cost,” she would answer Anne. “The woman is contained in the child: or
                        rather the woman is only the child altered and trimmed up to pass
                            muster—<foreign xml:lang="ger">dressirt</foreign>, as my friend
                        Schopenhauer says.”</p>
                    <p>“But, Auntie Claudia,” persisted Anne, “if a person can alter sufficiently to
                        pass muster, why should that person not alter also in obedience to her
                        awakened reason and conscience? Why should one not be able to shed the bad
                        qualities of one’s childhood, for quite new and good ones?”</p>
                    <p>“Because one cannot, Anne; because the fox remains a fox, and the cat remains
                        a cat, and the swine remains a swine.” And Mrs Macgregor looked with cynical
                        compassion at Anne.</p>
                    <pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7108-245"/>
                    <p>“I might have remained a mere soulless servant, had every one gone on your
                        theory,” answered Anne. “No, I cannot agree with you, Aunt Claudia. I think
                        it is terrible to condemn a woman because she was a good‐for‐nothing child;
                        I think it is terrible to shut her out from sympathy which might be a
                        comfort and an encouragement to her if she be still in need of any.”</p>
                    <p>“Ah, well, that is how you young people of to‐day always talk. You would
                        object to sending criminals to the docks, because it is shutting them out of
                        improving society.”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t see that the cases are parallel. I merely ask that a person be not
                        condemned where she could not be responsible. If I thought that any one were
                        really and hopelessly vicious, a mere source of evil, I think I should do my
                        best to crush them out, to trample upon them.”</p>
                    <p>“That is how you are, Anne, willing to be a moral sick‐nurse or a moral
                        executioner. In a world where every one has some horrid<pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7108-246"/> moral disease or is some horrid moral nuisance,
                        you will soon find that such a line as that leaves no time to live. However,
                        as to Sacha Polozoff—Madame Elaguine, I suppose I ought to call her—do
                        whatever you please. You are your own mistress, and free to choose your own
                        friends. See as much of the woman as you please, as long as you don’t expect
                        me to sympathise with you in your admiration, love, and awe of her.”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t feel any admiration or love or awe for Madame Elaguine. But I think
                        that she is a comparatively young woman, very impulsive and rather
                        injudicious, all alone here in London; and I think she ought not to be shut
                        out from the only house which she has, as Mr Hamlin’s cousin, a sort of
                        right to enter.”</p>
                    <p>“As you choose, Anne. Invite her, give up the house to her; do what you
                        please. But remember, when you have burnt your fingers, that I told you you
                        were playing with fire.”</p>
                    <pb n="249" xml:id="VAB7108-247"/>
                    <p>So Anne had her way. And Madame Elaguine came often to Hammersmith. Hamlin
                        and Anne did their best to prevent her meeting Mrs Macgregor; Madame
                        Elaguine was received mainly in the studio, where, little by little, and at
                        first seemingly casually, Hamlin’s friends would drop in to meet her. She
                        was a curiously fascinating little woman. Education, in any regular sense,
                        she seemed never to have had; she was grotesquely ignorant about a great
                        many things, and laughed at it herself.</p>
                    <p>“I am teaching myself arithmetic in order to teach my boy a little before he
                        goes to school,” she would say—or spelling, or grammar, or something
                        similar. On the other hand, she had a lot of superficial accomplishments,
                        like most Russians: she spoke four or five languages with tolerable
                        correctness and extraordinary fluency; she had, in some mysterious manner,
                        acquired Greek. She read little, and that little mainly novels and poetry;
                        but, with her Russian rapidity to adapt herself to a new position,<pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7108-248"/> she had scarcely realised that she had
                        been accidentally drafted into æsthetical society, before she had got
                        æsthetic literature, æsthetic gossip, and æsthetic modes of feeling at her
                        finger‐ends. She immediately understood the relative positions of Hamlin, of
                        Chough, of Dennistoun, of Lewis, and of all the others; and was able to talk
                        to each as he best liked to be talked to. She began with a passion for
                        Alfred de Musset, for Gautier, for Catulle Mendès, and she rapidly became an
                        enthusiast for Swinburne, for Rossetti, for Chough, and, above all, “for
                        that genius, <foreign xml:lang="fre">Monsieur mon cousin</foreign>.” She let
                        herself be talked to about æsthetic dresses, gravely listening (with only a
                        little side‐look of amusement at Hamlin or Anne) to Mrs Spencer’s strictures
                        on modern costumes, on stays, and heels, and tight waists and full skirts;
                        and she immediately set to work untrimming her frocks and making them up
                        into wondrous garments, not at all like what any æsthetic woman had ever
                        worn in her life, but queer, fantastic, delightful, neither<pb n="251" xml:id="VAB7108-249"/> Greek nor medieval, but individual and quaint and
                        fascinating.</p>
                    <p>“Dressmaking, as long as only pins are required, is my one talent, my one
                        accomplishment,” she would say, when any one admired the capricious
                        garments, in which she looked sometimes like a schoolgirl, and sometimes
                        like a page in woman’s clothes, and sometimes almost like a little nun. But
                        this was not the case. Without ever having learned, she sang with wonderful
                        charm: a small, childish, high voice, which trilled out Russian and Spanish
                        and French folk‐songs, and which had a strange, hot, passionate power of
                        singing those German songs which poor Anne, for all her fine voice (which
                        Chough used distressingly to compare with that of various equivocal singers
                        of former days) and her conscientious learning, could never succeed in
                        rendering. But the fact was that Madame Elaguine’s personality was
                        surrounded by a vague halo and shimmer of talents: she had never learned to
                        do anything, yet she could somehow do everything; she<pb n="252" xml:id="VAB7108-250"/> could write fearfully misspelt but fascinating
                        letters and bits of verse and prose; she could mimic and act.</p>
                    <p>“She is a first‐rate actress,” was one of the first things which Edmund
                        Lewis, who seemed at once singularly attracted and puzzled by her, found to
                        say about Madame Elaguine.</p>
                    <p>“You think that because she sometimes looks a little like Sarah Bernhardt,”
                        answered Hamlin, who never cared much to hear his cousin praised, since
                        everything which was praised in her seemed to point to a deficiency in
                        Anne.</p>
                    <p>“I think she is an actress because I see it,” answered Lewis, in his positive
                        way. “For my part, I don’t think any of you half appreciate all that there
                        is in Madame Elaguine.”</p>
                    <p>“A nice little kittenish, intelligent flirt; just the same as a hundred
                        Russian women one has known,” said Hamlin.</p>
                    <p>Lewis shook his head.</p>
                    <p>“That woman is not a mere ordinary flirt. She has an almost unique
                        temperament: she is a first‐rate medium; I feel it.”</p>
                    <pb n="253" xml:id="VAB7108-251"/>
                    <p>“You have felt so many people to be first‐rate mediums, Mr Lewis,” said Anne,
                        scornfully. “Do you remember, you thought once that I was one.”</p>
                    <p>“So I did. But this time I’m not mistaken;” and he gave Anne one of those
                        looks of fierce aversion which, loathing him as she did, she rather liked
                        from the little painter.</p>
                    <p>However, Lewis proved right this time. Madame Elaguine had scarcely ever
                        heard about spiritualism, but she threw herself into it with all her Russian
                        ardour, and in a very short time, under Lewis’s guidance, became a great
                        adept. Lewis declared that he had never met so gifted a medium in his life;
                        and, indeed, Madame Elaguine showed a perfectly marvellous power of going
                        off into trances, reading thoughts, and otherwise communicating with
                        spirit‐land.</p>
                    <p>A young doctor, one of Marjory Leigh’s hygienic demigods, whom she brought to
                        call on Anne, once met Madame Elaguine at Hammersmith. Anne noticed the way
                        in which he<pb n="254" xml:id="VAB7108-252"/> watched her face and manner;
                        she seemed somehow to interest him as a problem.</p>
                    <p>“Why were you staring so at Mr Hamlin’s cousin?” asked Marjory Leigh when the
                        Russian had left.</p>
                    <p>“Staring at her?” answered the Professor, vaguely.</p>
                    <p>“She is a very pretty woman, and very charming,” said Anne; “I think that is
                        sufficient explanation.”</p>
                    <p>“Well,” said the young doctor, a rough, brusque creature, “that wasn’t
                        exactly the reason. I was thinking how very—well, to put it plainly—how very
                        hysterical a subject that lady looks.”</p>
                    <p>“What do you mean by hysterical?” said Anne, quickly. “She is very nervous,
                        but she doesn’t seem to me to be at all subject to any kind of fits.”</p>
                    <p>“That’s not what <emph>we</emph> mean by hysteria,” exclaimed the doctor.
                        “Hysteria isn’t a fit of hysterics; it is a condition of morbid nervous
                        excitability, usually accompanied by a certain<pb n="255" xml:id="VAB7108-253"/> loss of will‐power. Hysterical subjects are a
                        kind of milder mad men and women; their characters undergo curious
                        modifications; they haven’t the same responsibilities as others. I wonder
                        whether that lady is not a spiritualist,—she looks like it.”</p>
                    <p>“She has let Mr Lewis, who has gone in a good deal for that sort of thing,
                        mesmerise her once or twice,” answered Anne. “I don’t believe in that
                        rubbish myself.”</p>
                    <p>“Nor do I. But there is this much of truth in it, that some sorts of
                        temperaments are naturally inclined to it, and that it reacts upon them. And
                        I should think it would be the case with that lady.”</p>
                    <p>“But surely,” hesitated Anne, “people who are in good health—who have never
                        had any kind of nervous illness or shock—don’t get into that state.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh yes, they do. It is often hereditary; one or two, or even sometimes only
                        one, depraved ancestor will do it for you.”</p>
                    <p>The recollection of all she had heard of<pb n="256" xml:id="VAB7108-254"/>
                        Sacha’s horrible profligate old Russian father, of her violent and weak and
                        constantly ailing mother, flashed across Anne. And then came also the
                        remembrance of those portraits at Wotton Hall—of those generations of weak
                        and depraved planters, who had been the grandfathers and granduncles of
                        Sacha as well as of Hamlin.</p>
                    <p>And any remaining ill‐will which Mrs Macgregor’s stories had left was swept
                        away. Anne did not like Madame Elaguine, in the same way that she liked the
                        Leighs or even Mrs Spencer; but she felt a sudden strong compassion for her.
                        Perhaps, she thought, there is more goodness in the world than I guessed.
                        And it seemed to her that this giddy little woman, with her passionate
                        desire for the welfare of her children, this woman who had struggled through
                        the disadvantages of hereditary weakness and corrupt training, was a sort of
                        a hero.</p>

                    <p><hi>AUTUMN</hi> turned to winter, and at last Hamlin’s long‐expected,
                        much‐talked‐of book of new poems made its appearance. In her gradual
                        estrangement from Hamlin, in the gradual replacing of the ideal creature
                        whom she had so fervently loved by a reality by which she was beginning to
                        be repelled, Anne had hung some of her last hopes to Hamlin’s poetry. She
                        would often say to herself that, after all, Hamlin made no pretence to being
                        anything more than an artistic nature; that he was a great artist, born to
                        give the world a certain amount of pleasure, and that she had no right to
                        ask of him to be anything else. What could she, willing as she was to
                        sympathise and to work,—what could a <pb n="258" xml:id="VAB7108-256"/> man
                        like Richard Brown, with all his self‐sacrificing energy and ability, do for
                        mankind that might compare with what had been done by Leonardo, by Mozart,
                        by Keats—men as solely artistic as Hamlin? and Hamlin <emph>was</emph> a
                        great poet, and would become a greater one—of that Anne felt persuaded, for
                        his work was steadily improving, and there were things in this book which
                        she recognised as having the highest merit. So she clung to Hamlin’s poetry
                        as to an anchor for his nobility and for her affection. At length the volume
                        was published. Hamlin arrived at Hammersmith one morning and placed a copy
                        of it by the side of Anne’s plate at breakfast.</p>
                    <p>“It is the first copy,” he said, “and as such, belongs to you.”</p>
                    <p>“Thank you,” said Anne, flushing with pleasure; for, opening the book, she
                        found on the fly‐leaf a little poem, imitated from the love‐songs of the
                        Tuscan peasants, in which Hamlin dedicated the volume to her; it was
                        beautiful and simple and almost solemn—the<pb n="259" xml:id="VAB7108-257"/>
                        very flower of that distant and poetic love which he professed towards
                        her.</p>
                    <p>“You have put in the ‘Ballad of the Fens’ after all! Oh, thank you so much,
                        Mr Hamlin! You know I always thought it the best thing you have ever done,”
                        she exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin did not answer; perhaps because he was aware that this “Ballad of the
                        Fens,” rewritten under the influence of Dennistoun, was not the same as the
                        one which he had torn up three months before. Anne soon discovered it:
                        reading through the still uncut sheets, she found that instead of the story
                        of married love, which had called down the wrath of the whole school, Hamlin
                        had set in his beautiful descriptions a ghastly tale which she scarcely
                        required more than to glance at. So this was all that had come of her having
                        mentioned Cold Fremley to him!</p>
                    <p>“I think I have made the story more tragic and more in harmony with the
                        surrounding nature. I always felt that I needed some more powerful and
                        terrible situation. Like this,<pb n="260" xml:id="VAB7108-258"/> I think the
                        effect is sufficiently worked out, don’t you think?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” said Anne, icily. There was the description of the sunset on the fens,
                        of the broad slow river flowing between low green banks, its clotted masses
                        reflecting the red sunset embers; the description of the whole scene as they
                        had witnessed it; and then a description of the people of Cold Fremley, of
                        their lives and sins, in which she could almost recognise her own words in
                        which she had vainly pleaded for them that memorable afternoon in his
                        studio. A cold terror prevented Anne from turning at once to the sonnets.
                        But after all, had he not, as it were, promised to abide by her choice? had
                        he not submitted, however reluctantly, to the condemnation of those twelve
                        sonnets? Anne felt ashamed of her own suspicions and fears; she boldly
                        turned to the end of the book, peeped between the leaves—</p>
                    <p>“Desire—XII. Sonnets.”</p>
                    <p>Anne did not know what was the feeling<pb n="261" xml:id="VAB7108-259"/>
                        which filled her. She had never felt it before. It was too cold to be
                        indignation, too self‐possessed to be horror: she seemed surrounded by an
                        icy atmosphere, through which she saw Hamlin as through a mist. He had
                        broken his word, and for what? To attribute to himself vicious thoughts and
                        feelings which he had never had. Anne said not a word; the man who was
                        capable of acting thus could not understand if he were chidden for it.</p>
                    <p>Breakfast passed gloomily, talking little, or of indifferent things. Hamlin
                        was evidently ruffled by this reception of his book.</p>
                    <p>“Are you going to sit to me this morning, Miss Brown?” he asked with some
                        irritation, as he rose from table.</p>
                    <p>“I will, if you wish me to.”</p>
                    <p>Anne’s voice smote him as if he had opened the window to a snowstorm.</p>
                    <p>“Have you anything else to do?”</p>
                    <p>“I always have plenty to do, you know. If you don’t want me, I shall go out
                        with Marjory Leigh.”</p>
                    <pb n="262" xml:id="VAB7108-260"/>
                    <p>“So much the better. I don’t feel as if I could work successfully this
                        morning, and I should be sorry to detain you for nothing at all. I will go
                        and ask my cousin whether she would care to see Lewis’s studio. This weather
                        is very depressing.”</p>
                    <p>“Very,” answered Anne.</p>
                    <p>Anne went out with Marjory Leigh, who was on a round of visiting poor people
                        at Lainbeth. They were joined by Harry Collett. He stood in great awe of his
                        future bride’s superior wisdom and dogmatic manner; but it was touching to
                        see how completely these two creatures—the shy and mystical curate, and the
                        masterful and rationalistic young woman, who was wont to tell him that some
                        day he should be persuaded that only secular work was really useful, and the
                        Church ought to be disestablished—understood each other, and sympathised in
                        their best endeavours.</p>
                    <p>“Hamlin has brought out a new book,” said Collett to Anne. “How proud you
                        must be, Miss Brown! he has been quite another man,<pb n="263" xml:id="VAB7108-261"/> twice as cheerful and devoted to his art, since
                        he has known you. For a poet like him, so sensitive and easily depressed, it
                        must be a great thing to have a noble woman to encourage him.”</p>
                    <p>Anne did not answer. She felt alone—alone as in a desert, without an ear to
                        hear her, or a hand to touch hers.</p>
                    <p>Often did that sensation recur to her now; a sensation as of dragging wearily
                        and alone along an ice‐bound road, under a grey wintry sky, weary and
                        solitary, but with the knowledge that the more solitary and weary she felt,
                        the more was she bound to plod on. Things that happened seemed spectral.
                        Here in London she saw less of Hamlin than in the country; he was going
                        about with his friends, he was at his cousin’s. She did not know or care
                        where. People talked a great deal about the new book; and only Anne was
                        silent.</p>
                    <p>“You don’t like Hamlin’s new book,” said Richard Brown to her one evening,
                        fixing his eyes upon her in his ruthless way. He came often now; he had
                        apparently got to believe in<pb n="264" xml:id="VAB7108-262"/> her, and he
                        even held out a possibility to her, if she continued to work steadily,
                        reading and attending lectures, that she might by the summer‐time be able to
                        offer herself to teach the elements of political economy at the Working
                        Women’s Club.</p>
                    <p>“You don’t like Hamlin’s new book.”</p>
                    <p><choice>
                            <corr>It</corr>
                            <sic>I</sic>
                        </choice> was not a question, but an assertion, and Anne felt it as a
                        taunt.</p>
                    <p>“I like some things in it extremely,” she answered boldly; “but I dislike and
                        disapprove of some others.”</p>
                    <p>Brown made a characteristic upward movement with one of his big black
                        eyebrows.</p>
                    <p>“I thought that you æsthetic folk never disapproved of anything—that it was
                        against the canons of art to disapprove.”</p>
                    <p>“I am not an æsthete, Richard. If I were, I should not be trying to learn the
                        things in which you take interest.”</p>
                    <p>“True. And does Hamlin know that you dislike and disapprove of some of his
                        poems?”</p>
                    <p>For a moment Anne did not answer.<pb n="265" xml:id="VAB7108-263"/> Brown’s
                        question was like an insolent attempt to see into her heart. Yet what right
                        had she to hide anything?</p>
                    <p>“He knows exactly what I think about all his poems; but he does not,
                        naturally, agree with me in all my views.”</p>
                    <p>She was determined to keep her cousin at a distance. He had hated her ever
                        becoming connected with æsthetic society, and he tried to force her to admit
                        that she regretted it.</p>
                    <p>But Brown had an inveterate hatred which he could not put aside.</p>
                    <p>“Have you seen the review in the ‘Saturday Gazette’?” he asked.</p>
                    <p>The review was one of the few bad ones which Hamlin’s book had had, among a
                        chorus of good ones. But it was written by a rabid enemy of pre‐Raphaelite
                        poetry; and who had taken the occasion of this book to show up what he
                        considered the pestilent moral condition of the whole school.</p>
                    <p>“Yes; I have. It is a very unjust and violent attack, and quite
                        indiscriminating.”</p>
                    <pb n="266" xml:id="VAB7108-264"/>
                    <p>“So I thought. Still, what it quoted from the sonnets called
                            <bibl><title>Desire</title></bibl> seemed, so far, to bear out its statements. What do
                        you think?”</p>
                    <p>“I think,” answered Anne slowly, and choking her pride and emotion, “that all
                        he says about those sonnets is quite correct. I think it is most regrettable
                        that they should have been published. But I think that in writing them Mr
                        Hamlin was merely following the vicious traditions of his school; and I know
                        that he is, in reality, a perfectly pure‐minded man. And,” she added, as if
                        to put an end to the conversation, “he is the man to whom I owe more
                        gratitude than any woman ever owed to any man.”</p>
                    <p>Brown did not press the conversation. He understood. He had of late been
                        getting to comprehend Anne’s character; he recognised her serious
                        unselfishness, her indomitable desire for good; he saw in her a strange
                        straining dissatisfaction—a something which was as the beating of a bird’s
                        wings against its cage. And now he understood whence it came.</p>
                    <pb n="267" xml:id="VAB7108-265"/>
                    <p>“She has made her choice and must abide by it,” he said sternly to himself,
                        remembering that scene when he had tried vainly to dissuade her from
                        accepting Hamlin’s offer, and she had answered, “I love him!” “She has sold
                        her soul into bondage, and must accept the isolation and silence and
                        uselessness of a slave.” But then, as he said good night and looked at that
                        noble face, whose tragic intensity of rectitude was now revealed to him,
                        Richard Brown could not help feeling a pang. “Poor child!” he said to
                        himself; and wished he had proved less of a prophet than he believed himself
                        to have done.</p>
                    <p>He began, in consequence, to feel a little ashamed of himself, and came
                        oftener to see Anne. He was a brilliant man when you got him on his own
                        subjects, warm‐hearted, self‐sacrificing, ambitious, eloquent; and he had
                        always a number of practical schemes at heart. Originally a hand at a
                        foundry, he had for some time, like Anne’s father, been smitten with
                        communistic theories; but instead of<pb n="268" xml:id="VAB7108-266"/> being
                        tempted into becoming a socialistic demagogue, he had, when he was about
                        twenty‐five, given up the little workman’s newspaper, of which he was editor
                        and chief author, and deliberately set to work studying economical and
                        social questions in the intervals of his work, carefully suspending his
                        judgment during the while. To a man as impetuous and ambitious as Brown, to
                        whom the easy and tempting path of party leader lay open, such a course must
                        have meant a terrible and long‐sustained effort of self‐control. But his
                        indomitable conscience and will had carried him through it; and now he was
                        reaping the unexpected reward of his forbearance. While slowly working his
                        way in business and studying the subjects which were dearest to him, he had
                        managed also to cultivate a mechanical genius, which seemed in some way
                        hereditary in the family of Anne’s father, who, in happier circumstances,
                        might perhaps have been a brilliant inventor instead of a starving
                        expatriated workman. He had made valuable <choice>

                            <reg>improvements</reg>
                        </choice> in the foundry of which he had become the foreman, and had now,
                        for the last two years, been the chief partner and virtual director of the
                        business, with a fair livelihood in the present, and a large fortune and
                        great influence in the immediate future. But money and influence were
                        nothing to Richard Brown; or rather, influence to him meant merely the
                        triumph of his own philanthropical schemes. Selfish he undoubtedly was, but
                        his selfishness, his vanity, his pride, his ambition, were drafted off into
                        the service of others. Anne listened with enthusiasm, but not unmixed with
                        sadness, to her cousin’s projects for educating the lower classes, for
                        bringing home to the upper classes their own responsibilities; they had the
                        charm of dreams, but of the dreams of a man who seemed able to make what he
                        desired into reality. Even in this æsthetic society, which had looked upon
                        him with suspicion and loathing, Richard Brown got a certain importance. He
                        would spend hours with old Saunders the painter, and<pb n="270" xml:id="VAB7108-268"/> his daughter, the enthusiastic Mrs Spencer,
                        discussing the way of introducing more beautiful patterns into trade, and of
                        getting up schools of design and loan exhibitions for the poorer
                        classes.</p>
                    <p>“He is a man of the middle ages!” Mrs Spencer would enthusiastically exclaim;
                        “if only we had a few more like <emph>him</emph>, we should soon build
                        cathedrals and town‐halls like those of the fourteenth century.”</p>
                    <p>“He is a canny Radical,” answered her father, “but a gude sort of man. For my
                        part, I don’t much believe in educating the lower classes up to art, but
                        there’s no harm in trying, and, at least, we shall get better‐made chairs
                        and tables for our money.”</p>
                    <p>Chough was equally enthusiastic. Richard Brown was anxious to get up some
                        concerts at a kind of workman’s union at which he presided; and Chough—yes,
                        the great Chough himself, who hinted mysteriously that his father (who was
                        an apothecary at Limerick) was a duke, but that he would rather die<pb n="271" xml:id="VAB7108-269"/> than succeed to the title—was prevailed
                        upon to take the musical direction upon himself. While these schemes were
                        going on, Madame Elaguine met Richard Brown.</p>
                    <p>There was something in this big, burly, rather brutal man, which immediately
                        fascinated the nervous little Russian woman: she sat at Brown’s feet, she
                        listened with rapture to his theories, she threw herself headlong into the
                        plan of the concerts; she offered to perform, to teach, to do whatever Brown
                        might wish.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin was thoroughly disgusted with his cousin Sacha, who had hitherto known
                        no divinity save him and pure beauty, when he saw her devoting herself to
                        humanitarianism, personified in what he called “that shoddy philanthropical
                        black brute.” He became vehemently devoted to Anne. He seemed to repent of
                        his book. He declared himself sick of London and of æsthetic society.</p>
                    <p>“I must turn over a new leaf,” he said. “I feel I must, or sink into being no
                        better than Chough or Dennistoun. But I am too weak<pb n="272" xml:id="VAB7108-270"/> to turn it over alone. Will you help me, Miss
                        Brown?”—and he looked at her with his slow, beautiful glance of Platonic
                        love.</p>
                    <p>Anne smiled sadly. “No one can help any one, I am beginning to fear; and I
                        least of all.” She had got so accustomed to these sudden returns of
                        Hamlin’s, to these false starts, these longings after a healthier moral and
                        intellectual atmosphere, which came to nothing. She saw so plainly the
                        hopeless weakness and thinness of his nature; and yet in such moments she
                        could not help feeling some of that old love for this beautiful, delicate,
                        idealistic, chivalrous creature whom she knew to be mere selfishness and
                        vanity. If only he would remain thus at least.</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps you are right,” answered Hamlin, leaning over the piano at which she
                        was seated; “but I feel myself sick of this life, this poetry. All is false,
                        false, hollow, and empty. My verses are untrue, my pictures are mere
                        Christmas cards; even with you as a model, I feel I am always repeating the
                            same<pb n="273" xml:id="VAB7108-271"/> wearisome insipid trick of eyes,
                        and mouth, and neck. Oh, I don’t know what to do!”</p>
                    <p>It was but too true. That school of mere beautiful suggestion, which scorned
                        reality and mechanical skill as a bird scorns the ground, was fast sinking
                        into nullity. Anne had often remarked it in comparing the works of various
                        masters; she had noticed the stray sentences, not meant for her, dropped by
                        painters of other schools.</p>
                    <p>“Go to Paris and study for a year or so under Bastien‐Lepage, or Henner, or
                        Duran,” she said, with a smile at the vanity of her own words.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin could not even conceive that she was in earnest, that any one could
                        dream of seeing anything in modern French painting, that any one could be so
                        mad as to think of <emph>his</emph> studying.</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” he cried, “that is the only art that can live in our day! Ours is a
                        mere phantom; our poetry is a phantom; they come round us imploring us to
                        give them life, like<pb n="274" xml:id="VAB7108-272"/> the ghosts round
                        Odysseus’s trench. But who shall give them life? Where shall we get the
                        life‐blood of passion whereon to feed and revivify them?”</p>
                    <p>And he suddenly turned round and looked at her with great yearning eyes.
                        Hamlin was genuinely unhappy, though he did not guess that his unhappiness
                        was due to vacuity, to slighted vanity, to the sudden infatuation of Madame
                        Elaguine for a shoddy philanthropist. He longed for passion as, in hot
                        climates, after months of faint sultriness, one longs for rain and wind; and
                        he looked at Anne as one might watch the dark clouds hanging on the hills,
                        the dark clouds which hold the storm for which one is thirsting. Oh for a
                        strong passion!—it would revive him, revive his art. Hamlin did not say it
                        to himself in so many words, but he felt it.</p>
                    <p>He talked long and vehemently about the necessity of going outside one’s
                        self, of transmuting one’s consciousness into that of another, of having
                        something beyond one’s self to<pb n="275" xml:id="VAB7108-273"/> live for.
                        He told Anne, always with those yearning eyes fixed upon her, that what was
                        wanted to revive the world and art (and by the world he meant himself) was
                        passion; but not the mere sultry passion which his school had sung about,
                        which merely enervated and sent to sleep, but the clear cold air, the
                        whirlwinds and thunderstorms of ideal love—of love such as Dante had felt
                        for Beatrice, and Heathcliff for Cathey. It was very eloquent and beautiful
                        what he said about this love, which was something vague and quite unselfish
                        and outside one’s self,—a sort of act of adoration and purification and
                        renunciation,—a meeting of two souls which vibrated in unison in their
                        desire for the good and the noble. While he spoke, Anne almost believed that
                        he was sincere; sincere, indeed, he was, but according to his nature, not
                        hers. She felt the tears coming into her eyes, and a vague wish to throw
                        herself into his arms and implore him to cast aside his selfish habits, to
                        live for the life of other men and<pb n="276" xml:id="VAB7108-274"/> for her
                        love, came to her heart. But when, suddenly, their conversation was
                        interrupted by the entry of Edmund Lewis and Madame Elaguine, it all ebbed
                        back, till her whole nature seemed to burst. She felt that he did not know
                        what he was saying, what he did not comprehend what he was wanting; she felt
                        the uselessness of saying to this man that the world and herself were
                        waiting for him to love them, that her whole nature was sickening for want
                        of one with which to vibrate in harmony of desire for the good and the
                        noble. Cold Fremley, the sonnets, a hundred little words and looks which had
                        made the chasm between them, returned to her. She felt once more alone,
                        terribly and hopelessly alone.</p>
                    <p>And still, when she met her cousin Dick, and realised how different he was,
                        how genuine and strong and passionate for good, she could not help
                        experiencing a sort of repulsion from him, and a melancholy, hopeless
                        throwing of herself back on to the unreal Hamlin.<pb n="277" xml:id="VAB7108-275"/> She felt that Richard Brown, with all his
                        nobility and energy of nature, would never have done for her what Hamlin had
                        done, would never have been for her what Hamlin had been; that he would
                        never have singled her out, her a mere servant, and guessed that in her
                        there was a soul which could love and could aspire. But after all, why had
                        Hamlin singled her out? and what had he guessed in her, what had he hoped
                        from her? That line of Rossetti’s, which Hamlin admired more than any other,
                        which he so often quoted— <q>
                            <l>“Beauty like hers is genius,”—</l>
                        </q> returned to her with a chill; and she felt that Hamlin wanted, expected
                        from her that sort of passion which he had spoken of to revive him and his
                        art. It seemed to her as if she had been sold in the slave‐market, and were
                        being told “now love.”</p>

                    <p><hi>RICHARD BROWN</hi> did not let Madame Elaguine sit at his feet very long.
                        After about a fortnight of extremely assiduous visits at the Russian lady’s
                        house at Kensington, during which he poured out to the enthusiastic little
                        woman all his philanthropical schemes, Richard suddenly gave up calling, and
                        even avoided meeting Madame Elaguine at other houses.</p>
                    <p>“Why have you deserted Madame Elaguine so suddenly?” asked Anne of her
                        cousin. To confess the truth, Anne was rather malicious in her question. She
                        had speedily recognised the vanity, or rather the self‐sufficiency, the
                        belief in his own irresistible uniqueness, which was the leaven of Cousin
                        Dick’s virtues, and she had been amused from the first at seeing<pb n="279" xml:id="VAB7108-277"/> how this earnest philanthropist had let himself
                        be caught by Madame Elaguine’s conscious or unconscious instinct of
                        flirtation; and now, she thought, Dick has suddenly awaked from his dream of
                        having fascinated and converted her. Anne smiled as she asked the question,
                        but there was sadness as well as amusement in her smile. In his way—his
                        blind, self‐satisfied, unselfish way—Dick was as vain as Hamlin: wherever
                        she looked vanity and hollowness met her, and she herself could not even
                        conceive what vanity was.</p>
                    <p>“Why have you deserted Madame Elaguine?” repeated Anne.</p>
                    <p>Brown suddenly raised his big, rough, black head from the review which he had
                        been mechanically looking at, and answered, looking straight in front of
                        him—</p>
                    <p>“Don’t speak to me about Madame Elaguine; she is an odious woman.”</p>
                    <p>There was something brief and silencing in his tone which surprised Anne and
                        precluded further questions.</p>
                    <pb n="280" xml:id="VAB7108-278"/>
                    <p>“In fact,” added Richard Brown, “if it were not that a woman like you will
                        never even understand what Madame Elaguine is made of, I should peremptorily
                        say that she is not a person for you to know.”</p>
                    <p>Anne was indignant, and yet, at the same time, a little shocked.</p>
                    <p>“Why, what has Madame Elaguine done?”</p>
                    <p>“Done!” answered Brown, half waiving the subject, and half insisting upon it,
                        as self‐important men frequently do. “Why, she has <emph>done</emph>
                        nothing. But that makes no difference; she’s an odious woman.”</p>
                    <p>Anne laughed bitterly. The whole world seemed so awry, every one seeing
                        everything through the crooked spectacles of his own vanity. Now here was
                        Dick insinuating evil against a woman because he had been such a big baby as
                        to fancy her in love with him.</p>
                    <p>“Men are very unjust!” cried Anne; “they always trump up some mysterious sin
                        to justify their unreasonable aversions.”</p>
                    <p>Brown reddened, and was on the point of<pb n="281" xml:id="VAB7108-279"/>
                        saying something. But he checked himself, and merely remarked—</p>
                    <p>“Oh, of course women always fancy that they understand each other better than
                        a man can.”</p>
                    <p>“So they can! A woman can always understand another woman better than a man
                        can, who attributes all sorts of nasty masculine faults to women, or
                        suspects imaginary feminine ones, when he doesn’t see clear. Oh yes, I know:
                        every woman is weak, vain, a creature of impulse and passion, something
                        half‐way only between the man and the child, as I read in a French paper,
                        with a kind of sham character, like the backbones of cartilage or jelly of
                        some lower creatures!”</p>
                    <p>Brown shook his head.</p>
                    <p>“Most women are like that, but not all; not you, Anne, for instance.”</p>
                    <p>“Thank you,” answered Anne, scornfully.</p>
                    <p>“But all women, at least all noble women, are unable to judge of other women.
                        How should they judge? It is only a man, or a<pb n="282" xml:id="VAB7108-280"/> base woman, who knows of the mud out of which
                        many women, like many men, are moulded.”</p>
                    <p>“One does not need to be base to know that,” said Anne, half to herself; and
                        she thought of the mud which she had discovered in her own silver idol.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t think we are alluding to the same thing,” said Cousin Dick, turning
                        off the conversation.</p>
                    <p>“Mere vanity, and the injustice of vanity,” said Anne to herself, and her
                        pessimism became more confirmed. But later, although she continued to
                        believe quite equally in Richard Brown’s vanity, she began to suspect that
                        there had been in this coarse‐looking man a movement of modesty, an
                        unwillingness to let her eyes rest upon some nasty thing which he had seen.
                        But of this, at present, she had no idea, and Madame Elaguine, although she
                        did not find much in common with her, became for Anne another victim of the
                        vanity and injustice of the world.</p>
                    <pb n="283" xml:id="VAB7108-281"/>
                    <p>They saw a good deal of the little woman now. Anne thought she understood her
                        thoroughly, and owned to herself that she had not understood her at first.
                        She recognised that the little woman had much more character than she had at
                        first imagined; and the impression of frailness, childishness, and
                        helplessness which something in Madame Elaguine’s appearance, manner, and
                        voice had at first given her, wore away so completely that she could
                        scarcely believe it had ever existed. Eccentric and irresponsible she still
                        seemed, always rushing from one enthusiasm to another, always thirsting for
                        excitement; but Anne found that instead of a childish girl who could lean
                        upon her, she had to deal with a woman, undisciplined and capricious indeed,
                        but still, in many respects, more of a woman than herself. She was flighty
                        and giddy like her own little girl in many respects, and fully as ignorant
                        of many things; but she had a knowledge of sides of life which Anne
                        instinctively guessed, and from which she <choice>
                            <orig>re‐<pb n="284" xml:id="VAB7108-282"/> coiled</orig>
                            <reg>recoiled</reg>
                        </choice>. With an extraordinary love of the beautiful, the fantastic, and
                        the ideal, which, as it made her dress herself in queer <foreign xml:lang="fre">ingénue</foreign> little costumes, also made her mould
                        her conduct, ideas, and words rather theatrically in obedience to a
                        conception of something striking and pretty,—Madame Elaguine had, at the
                        same time, a vein—no, Anne thought it must be a mere exterior dab, not due
                        to her inner nature, but to her Russian and Continental education—of
                        coarseness, which surprised and pained Miss Brown. Once or twice, in Anne’s
                        presence, she alluded to things in a manner which gave Anne a shock; and
                        Anne, who, half Italian as she was, and wholly fearless and unprudish, would
                        ask herself what right she had had to feel like that; she would analyse
                        Madame Elaguine’s words, and find them, when measured by a Continental
                        standard, very harmless; yet somehow, though she told herself that she was
                        stupid and unjust, something of the painful impression would remain. Also,
                        she could not conceive<pb n="285" xml:id="VAB7108-283"/> how a woman could
                        like to sit for hours, as Madame Elaguine did, on the score of spiritual
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">séances</foreign>, with a man like Edmund Lewis.
                        She never heard him talk on anything objectionable to the Russian; and yet
                        there was something to her inconceivable in the endurance of this man by a
                        young woman. Anne came to the conclusion that she must be growing horribly
                        prejudiced and unjust; and the less she could sympathise with some of Madame
                        Elaguine’s tastes (though there was nothing really objectionable in them)
                        the more did she force herself to try and understand, and make allowance
                        for, and help the little woman. And one day Anne’s sympathies were really
                        enlisted for her.</p>
                    <p>It was about Christmas, and Anne had prevailed upon Hamlin to accompany her
                        and Madame Elaguine to a pantomime, to which the Russian was taking her
                        little girl, and Anne the two Chough children. Anne amused herself heartily,
                        as she always did, at every sort of theatrical performance, with the love<pb n="286" xml:id="VAB7108-284"/> of shows and acting in her Italian blood;
                        she was so happy laughing with the children, while Hamlin talked with his
                        cousin and Chough in the back of the box, that that evening long remained a
                        sort of oasis in the dreariness of her inner life. There was a tremendous
                        crush in the lobbies and on the stairs;. and while Chough shoved on his two
                        children, and Hamlin tried to make way through the crowd for his frail
                        little cousin, who looked as if she would be knocked over and trampled like
                        a feather, Anne, towering through the throng (and people turned to look at
                        that magnificent pale face, set in crisp black hair, and said to each other,
                        “Look there; that’s Miss Brown, the famous pre‐Raphaelite beauty”), held
                        Sacha Elaguine’s little girl close in front of her, calmly making the crowd
                        divide as a ship divides the water. They were fairly out of the theatre, on
                        the steps looking out into the street, with the gas burning dim in the fog,
                        and the long splashes of yellow light on pavement and wet cab‐tops,<pb n="287" xml:id="VAB7108-285"/> waiting in the damp cold, while Chough
                        called their carriage, and Madame Elaguine, leaning on Hamlin’s arm, the two
                        little Choughs by her side, had heaved a sigh of relief, and exclaimed—</p>
                    <p>“Oh, how delicious it is to be in the cold, and fog, and dark, after that
                        theatre!—”</p>
                    <p>When little Hélène Elaguine, who was holding Anne’s hand, and see‐sawing from
                        one leg to another—while staring at the men in opera hats and comforters,
                        and the ladies and children huddled in furs, and the policemen and cabmen
                        who passed in front—suddenly gave a piercing shriek, and threw herself into
                        Anne’s arms, clinging to her and burying her head in her pelisse.</p>
                    <p>“Good heavens! what’s the matter, child?” cried Anne, mechanically clasping
                        the little girl round the waist.</p>
                    <p>“What’s the matter?” cried Hamlin, who had not seen this action.</p>
                    <p>But Madame Elaguine had let go his arm and darted forward, white as ashes,
                        and seized<pb n="288" xml:id="VAB7108-286"/> her child from Anne, and
                        cried—“Let us go! let us go!” in an agonised voice.</p>
                    <p>The carriage came up, and she jumped into it, scarcely giving Hamlin and Anne
                        time to follow, and leaving Chough and his children amazed before the
                        theatre door.</p>
                    <p>The carriage stopped at her door in Kensington.</p>
                    <p>“I cannot pass this night alone with only Helen and the servants! I cannot, I
                        cannot!”</p>
                    <p>And Madame Elaguine burst into tears, strangely intermingled with hysterical
                        laughs.</p>
                    <p>“They want to take my child away; they are trying it again!”</p>
                    <p>“What is to be done?” asked Hamlin.</p>
                    <p>“I will stay to‐night with Madame Elaguine,” said Anne, with decision; “if
                        you will go to Hammersmith and tell Aunt Claudia’s maid that your cousin was
                        feeling ill, and I am staying with her till to‐morrow. Help Madame Elaguine
                        out, will you?”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin lifted his cousin out of the carriage, while Anne took charge of the
                            child,<pb n="289" xml:id="VAB7108-287"/> whom its nurse carried up in a
                        condition of lethargic sleep.</p>
                    <p>When they were in Madame Elaguine’s drawing‐room, the Russian took the child
                        in her arms, and flinging herself on a sofa, burst out crying, her sobs
                        interrupted by moaning complaints that some one wanted to take her child
                        away.</p>
                    <p>“I will go to Hammersmith now, and leave you with her,” whispered Hamlin to
                        Anne, who had knelt down by the side of the sofa.</p>
                    <p>“I will come to‐morrow morning for news; good night.”</p>
                    <p>“Good night,” answered Anne, under her breath.</p>
                    <p>But Madame Elaguine heard. She started up, and looking wildly about—</p>
                    <p>“Oh, don’t leave me alone yet!” she cried.</p>
                    <p>“Miss Brown will remain, Sacha,” said Hamlin.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, don’t leave me yet, Walter!” repeated<pb n="290" xml:id="VAB7108-288"/>
                        Madame Elaguine. “I am afraid—I am afraid of Miss Brown.”</p>
                    <p>“I think you had better remain, Mr Hamlin,” whispered Anne; “she will
                        probably be quiet in a minute or two.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin took a chair near the table, and looked on in surprise. Madame
                        Elaguine was stretched on the sofa, her sleeping child pressed close to her;
                        her little head, with its short pale curls, thrown back; her eyes half
                        closed, moaning and gasping and sobbing; and Anne, kneeling by her side,
                        looking anxiously into that curious, convulsed face.</p>
                    <p>“Do you think she is going to faint?” asked Hamlin of his cousin’s Swiss
                        maid, who stood by, the picture of self‐satisfied composure.</p>
                    <p>“Oh no—Monsieur need be under no apprehension. Madame often had <foreign xml:lang="fre">de ces crises</foreign>; Madame was often frightened like
                        that. It was the first time since Madame was in England, but it was quite
                        common. Madame,” added the servant quietly, “has probably seen her black
                        man—”</p>
                    <pb n="291" xml:id="VAB7108-289"/>
                    <p>“What black man?” asked Hamlin.</p>
                    <p>Sacha Elaguine had suddenly raised herself on her elbow,—as if she had heard
                        the maid’s words.</p>
                    <p>“Take Mademoiselle Hélène to bed, Sophie,” she said quietly.</p>
                    <p>“Shan’t I take her?” asked Anne.</p>
                    <p>“Sophie knows how to manage her,” answered Madame Elaguine; and sitting up,
                        she drew the half‐wakened child close to her and kissed her with convulsive
                        passion. Yet she let the maid carry off the little one, and merely let
                        herself slip down on the couch with a moan, putting aside her heavy fur and
                        passing her hands through her pale blond hair, and moaning.</p>
                    <p>“Don’t you think you had better go?” said Anne to Hamlin. “I will look after
                        your cousin.” She would loathe to have Hamlin sitting there, looking at her,
                        if she were in Madame Elaguine’s condition.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin rose.</p>
                    <p>“Stop a minute,” said his cousin faintly,<pb n="292" xml:id="VAB7108-290"/>
                        turning round and fixing her vague northern blue eyes on him; “stop a
                        minute, Walter.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin remained standing, his eyes involuntarily fixed upon the curious
                        spectacle of this prostrate little figure, panting and gasping as if going
                        to die, and half unconscious of any one’s presence—her cloak thrown back on
                        the sofa, her hair tangled, her bare arms and neck (for it was one of her
                        caprices always to go the play, even to the pantomime, full dress) half
                        covered by the fur of her pelisse and the lace of her dress.</p>
                    <p>“Stay a minute; I want to explain,” repeated the Russian, in a faint voice.
                        “Anne—dear Anne—where are you?”</p>
                    <p>“Here I am,” answered Anne, in her cheerful strong voice; “do you want
                        anything, dear Madame Elaguine?”</p>
                    <p>“I want <emph>you</emph>,” and Sacha flung her arms round Anne’s neck, and
                        drew her dark head close to her own little pale yellow one. Anne felt her
                        arms tighten passionately round her, her little hand tighten convulsively
                        round her<pb n="293" xml:id="VAB7108-291"/> neck, as if the half‐fainting
                        woman would throttle her,—but she felt no fear, only a vague, undefinable
                        repulsion. Madame Elaguine sighed a long sigh of relief, and loosened her
                        hold; but she kept Anne’s face near hers, and kissed her with hot lips on
                        the forehead.</p>
                    <p>“Dear Anne,” she said, “forgive me.”</p>
                    <p>“There is nothing to forgive,” said Anne, trying to get loose and to rise to
                        her feet. But Madame Elaguine kept her down in her kneeling posture, her arm
                        always round Anne’s shoulder.</p>
                    <p>“I must explain it all to you,” she said, in a slow, vague tone, fixing her
                        eyes upon Hamlin. “Don’t think me very foolish or mad; but I thought they
                        were again trying to carry off my little Helen,—they have tried before,—and
                        they keep writing to me, telling me that they will carry off Helen or kill
                        me. I don’t care about that,—but Helen!” and Madame Elaguine hid her face in
                        Anne’s iron‐black hair.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin looked on as in a dream. It was a<pb n="294" xml:id="VAB7108-292"/>
                        curious sight, these two women, so different, and yet both so young and
                        beautiful, the one clinging so to the other; and of the two, Madame
                        Elaguine, whom he had never thought regularly handsome, with her thin,
                        strange face, and red lips, and wild eyes, seemed to him at this moment the
                        stranger and more beautiful of the two.</p>
                    <p>“I want to explain it all,” said Madame Elaguine. “Walter, give me that
                        box—the little Indian inlaid one on the writing‐table—there, next to the
                        palm‐tree.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin brought the box; and Madame Elaguine, without letting go her hold of
                        Anne, pressed a spring and opened it. It was full to the brim of
                        letters—some large and folded in their envelopes, others mere scraps of
                        paper. She took some out, and spread them on her knees.</p>
                    <p>“Look,” she said, letting Anne go, so that she could, while still kneeling,
                        see the papers.</p>
                    <p>Anne raised herself, and Hamlin approached.</p>
                    <p>“Look at these,” said the Russian, carefully<pb n="295" xml:id="VAB7108-293"/> handling the soiled and crumpled pieces of paper; “these are to me what
                        love‐letters are to other women,—they are my life—my past, and my future.”
                        And she fixed her eyes wildly on Hamlin. “As other women have lived on
                        knowing that they were loved and would always be loved, so I have lived,
                        ever since I was twenty, knowing that I was surrounded by invisible enemies,
                        who would either put a sudden end to my life or protract it with their
                        tortures. Ah! I know you think me giddy, and fickle, and childish; but you
                        don’t know that I try to lose my wits in order that I may gain some peace!”
                        her voice burst out hot and passionate.</p>
                    <p>Anne and Hamlin were shyly fingering the papers; they were all in the same
                        hand—a curious, crabbed, left‐handed character—some in French, some in
                        English, some in Russian, but all brief and to the same purpose: initials of
                        which neither Anne nor Hamlin understood the meaning at the head, and below
                        a threat of something terrible, sometimes left vague,<pb n="296" xml:id="VAB7108-294"/> sometimes outspoken, as death, to what was styled
                        the traitress. Many of them said that what could not be visited on the
                        mother should be visited on the children, and all concluded with saying that
                        wherever the traitress went she would be followed by invisible eyes and
                        footsteps.</p>
                    <p>“It was all my fault in the beginning,” began Madame Elaguine, covering her
                        eyes with her hands; “but I was very young, ignorant, and lonely; and after
                        all, what harm did I do? I had been married when I was only seventeen to a
                        man whom I thought of as a father; and little by little, when I found what
                        sort of man he was—how base, and coarse, and cunning—I began to feel very
                        lonely and empty‐hearted. I was too young to care for my children, who were
                        babies, and I was a baby myself. But it was all so lonely, and the world so
                        mean about me. I longed to be of some use, and able to sacrifice myself for
                        something. And a man was sent across my path, twice as old as myself, whom I
                            looked<pb n="297" xml:id="VAB7108-295"/> upon as a father, and who
                        treated me as a child; and this man used to talk to me, when my husband left
                        me all alone to run after low women, and tell me all about the miserable
                        condition of Russia, and how all the good was being stamped out, and only
                        selfishness, and injustice, and corruption triumphed. He was a Nihilist
                        himself, and one of their chief men—a wonderful man, who seemed so cold, and
                        just, and honest. So, little by little, he converted me to his ideas, and I
                        got to know other Nihilists, men and women, and heard a great deal about all
                        sorts of terrible doings. I felt so happy and heroic—I was a fool, you see.
                        Then I suddenly discovered that my hero was quite different from what I
                        thought—that he had gained all this power over me only in hopes of making
                        shameful use of it, and had cornpromised me with his party merely to make me
                        his mistress. When I understood it, I drove him away, and threatened to tell
                        all to my husband; and then he swore to get the better of me, and to use all
                        the power of his society to<pb n="298" xml:id="VAB7108-296"/> bring me, as
                        he called it, to reason. For two years, while my husband was alive, I
                        struggled with him, and he kept on threatening and hoping to frighten me.
                        But when my husband died, I sold all the Russian property, and was preparing
                        to leave the country, and then that man who hated me, just because in his
                        way he had loved me, denounced me to his society as a traitor to the
                        Nihilist cause, and as a person to be hunted down. And so, ever since, I
                        have been persecuted with all the might of the Nihilists wielded by this
                        man; and although I have been hundreds of times on the point of denouncing
                        him and his associates to the Government, I have never done so, because I am
                        still a Nihilist at heart, and hate the Russian Government as much as I hate
                        him; and he, who knows it, knows I cannot defend myself, and employs his
                        power in tormenting me.”</p>
                    <p>A convulsion passed across Madame Elaguine’s face; it dropped, like that of a
                        dying person. But she started up suddenly, and went on with her story. For
                        ten years nearly she had been<pb n="299" xml:id="VAB7108-297"/> persecuted
                        in this mysterious way; threatening letters had come to her by all manner of
                        conveyances,—brought by the post, found on her table, dropped by invisible
                        hands at her feet. Attempts had been made to poison her, stopped just in
                        time to let her know of them—for the object seemed rather to make her life
                        unbearable than to take it away; burning spirits of wine had been poured
                        under her door; twice she had been shot at. But the most terrible part of
                        the persecution had come when they had discovered her passionate love for
                        her little girl (the boy, now at school, they had somehow let alone).
                        Several times, in various places (for she was always on the move, flying her
                        enemies), attempts had been made to carry off the child; once, at Cannes,
                        she had gone to the window just in time to see a man snatch up the child,
                        who was playing in the garden, and to fire off a revolver at him.</p>
                    <p>“If I had killed my child,” said Madame Elaguine, savagely, “it would have
                        been better than to see her carried away from me.”</p>
                    <pb n="300" xml:id="VAB7108-298"/>
                    <p>The individual who had made these attempts she described as being very dark,
                        as if his complexion had been altered by overdoses of nitrate of silver. And
                        this man would every now and then, at unexpected moments, reappear, and his
                        reappearance meant some fresh outrage. Poor little Helen had suddenly seen
                        him, or thought she had seen him, among the crowd coming out of the theatre;
                        and this had produced the child’s sudden fit.</p>
                    <p>“Ever since I have come to London,” said Madame Elaguine, “I have been
                        comparatively quiet. I was almost forgetting all about my misfortunes, or
                        thinking I was forgotten—and here it begins afresh;” and she burst into
                        tears.</p>
                    <p>“Oh why, why cannot I be permitted to be happy for a little while—only a
                        little while?” she cried.</p>
                    <p>Anne had listened awe‐stricken. She had always thought there was something
                        mysterious about this giddy little woman. This frightful undeserved calamity
                        struck down her<pb n="301" xml:id="VAB7108-299"/> imagination; what right
                        had she ever to feel unhappy in the presence of such misery as this?</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps,” she suggested timidly—“perhaps it may have been Helen’s fancy. As
                        she is used to the idea of this black man, she may have imagined, being
                        tired and overexcited from the play, that she saw him among the crowd.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh no, no, it was he, really he,” moaned Madame Elaguine, turning over on
                        the sofa and burying her face in its cushions.</p>
                    <p>“You must go now,” whispered Anne to Hamlin; “there is no earthly use in your
                        staying. I will sit up with her till she be quiet. Good night.”</p>
                    <p>“Good night;” and Hamlin, as he noiselessly opened the door, cast a last
                        glance at that singular group in the rose‐coloured light of his cousin’s
                        lamp,—Sacha, with her fur and lace all in disarray, gasping on the couch,
                        her bare throat heaving, and one of her thin white arms hanging loosely by
                        her side; and Anne<pb n="302" xml:id="VAB7108-300"/> Brown, in her long
                        plain white dress of high art simplicity of cut, stooping over her. For some
                        time Anne sat by Sacha’s side, holding the Russian’s hot hand.</p>
                    <p>“Is Walter gone?” suddenly asked Madame Elaguine, turning her head.</p>
                    <p>“Mr Hamlin went some minutes ago.”</p>
                    <p>Madame Elaguine raised herself and sat up on the sofa, and passed her little
                        hands through her disorderly yellow hair.</p>
                    <p>“Give me a kiss, Annie,” she said.</p>
                    <p>Anne stooped down and kissed her.</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps I had better go to bed now,” said Madame Elaguine.</p>
                    <p>“Shall I help you to undress?” asked Anne, who feared that Hamlin’s cousin
                        might have another fit of hysterics.</p>
                    <p>“Oh no; call Sophie—she will undress me.”</p>
                    <p>On Anne’s call, the Swiss maid emerged from the next room.</p>
                    <p>“Put me to bed,” ordered Sacha, rising and leaning on the arm of the
                        sofa.</p>
                    <pb n="303" xml:id="VAB7108-301"/>
                    <p>“May I really not help you?” asked Anne, for the maid looked so indifferent,
                        nay, so sulky, and she seemed to handle her mistress so roughly, that Miss
                        Brown wondered how Madame Elaguine, in her state of nerves, could endure to
                        be helped by her.</p>
                    <p>Anne waited till Madame Elaguine was in bed.</p>
                    <p>“I have made up the bed for Mademoiselle in the spare room,” said the maid,
                        looking at Anne with a curious insolence; and she led her up‐stairs. Anne
                        did not put out the lamp, and she did not undress. She could not sleep; and
                        she felt miserable at the notion of Madame Elaguine being left all alone on
                        the first floor. What if the little woman should wake up with a panic, if
                        she were to fancy that some of her mysterious persecutors were hiding in her
                        room? Anne took the lamp, and silently descended into the drawing‐room. All
                        was quiet. She sat down in an arm‐chair, and made up the dying fire. She
                        felt very restless and unable to sleep. The whole scene<pb n="304" xml:id="VAB7108-302"/> of this night and Sacha’s revelations had shaken
                        her nerves and gone to her imagination. In her half‐drowsy, dreamy
                        condition, everything seemed to her strange and eerie in this room, which
                        was so unlike her own at Hammersmith. It was full of pretty things, but in
                        great confusion; Sacha’s piano was still open, with a book of Rubinstein’s
                        songs on it. There was a heap of dog’s‐eared French novels and recent
                        volumes of poetry on the table, and the whole room was heavy with the scent
                        of some Eastern drug and of Madame Elaguine’s Turkish cigarettes. On the
                        table by Anne’s side were some books: she took up one, and opened it at
                        random; it was Hamlin’s new volume. At the head of the page was the title,
                        “Desire—XII. Sonnets,” and all along the margin was a faint line in pencil,
                        and the words, in a childish hand, “How beautiful! and how <emph rend="sc">TRUE</emph>!”</p>

                    <p><hi>THE</hi> notion that a man was waiting, thirsting for her love, would
                        have been enough for many a woman in Anne’s position—many a woman more
                        gifted than Anne, and more conscious of her gifts, especially if the man who
                        thus tacitly implored her to love and kindle love in him, were, like Hamlin,
                        the former object of passionate worship. But with Anne Brown it was
                        different. Some few women seem to be born to have been men, or at least not
                        to have been women. To them love, if it come, will be an absorbing passion,
                        but a passion only of brief duration, the mere momentary diversion into a
                        personal and individual channel of a force which constitutes the whole moral
                        and intellectual existence, whose object is an <choice>

                            <reg>unattainable</reg>
                        </choice> ideal of excellence, and whose field is the whole of the world in
                        which there is injustice, and callousness, and evil. Such women may be very
                        happy if they love a man with their eyes open—love him as a mere secondary
                        concern, as a mere trusty companion in the struggle after the ideal; but if
                        they love in a man what momentarily seems to be that ideal, if they love
                        with all the force of their nature, a terrible reaction of vacuity and
                        despair must soon come. As with their lovers and husbands, so also with
                        their children: they cannot blissfully concentrate all their passion upon
                        them; such love will soon become narrow and bitter for them. They are indeed
                        sent into the world (if any of us is ever sent for any purpose) to be its
                        Joans of Arc—to kindle from their pure passion a fire of enthusiasm as
                        passionate, but purer than it is given to men to kindle: they are not
                        intended to be, except as a utilisation of what is fatally wasted, either
                        wives or mothers. Masculine women, mere men in disguise, they are not: the
                            very<pb n="309" xml:id="VAB7108-306"/> strength and purity of their
                        nature, its intensity as of some undiluted spirit, is dependent upon their
                        cleaner and narrower woman’s nature, upon their narrowness and obstinacy of
                        woman’s mind; they are, and can only be, true women; but women without
                        woman’s instincts and wants, sexless—women made not for man but for
                        humankind. Anne Brown was one of these. She had no idea that she was of this
                        strange, rare stuff of heroines; she had no notion that she was at all
                        superior to the ordinary run of her sex; indeed it was her perfect ignorance
                        of her own exceptional nature which caused most of her wretchedness, making
                        her at once more impatient with the weakness of others, and more impatient
                        with her own difficulty of being satisfied. Love, therefore, was not for her
                        a happiness, nor an ideal, nor even a compensation. In an intensely earnest
                        nature like hers, a few years are worth a lifetime: everything is
                        understood, endured much sooner; all that can be felt, for pleasure or pain,
                        is rapidly exhausted, and the character remains<pb n="310" xml:id="VAB7108-307"/> early, with all its human lusts and vanities
                        burnt out like the gases in green wood, ready to become the fuel for
                        unindividual ideal passion. So at twenty‐three, Anne had, so to speak, loved
                        out her love, her passionate adoring love, as she had dreamed out the dreams
                        of her life; anything that might still come would be but a faint momentary
                        flicker of sentiment, a detail in her life, and no more.</p>
                    <p>So when Hamlin had, in his veiled way, made her to understand what he hoped,
                        what he desired, what he expected, what (she could not help saying to
                        herself) he had bargained for, of her,—the thought of this love, which she
                        could no longer feel, and which she was expected to give—of this love which
                        was to be merely the highest selfish pleasure, the most precious (because
                        the most refined), æsthetic lust of a selfish æsthetic voluptuary, Anne
                        experienced a sense of horror and self‐debasement. So this was what Hamlin
                        was waiting for—this which made him play that comedy of respectful distant
                        adoration, of freedom of<pb n="311" xml:id="VAB7108-308"/> choice in her, of
                        absence of all rights in himself—this that her solid mass of soul should
                        slowly take fire, and smoulder, and, leaping up in inextinguishable flame,
                        set him also ablaze.</p>
                    <p>Hitherto Anne had been unhappy from her isolation, from her gradual discovery
                        that the man whom she had loved as an ideal of nobility must be scorned as a
                        mere weak‐spirited and morbid‐minded artistic automaton,—a mind creating
                        beautiful things from sheer blind necessity, as a violin gives out beautiful
                        sounds, but soulless, like the mere instrument of wood and string. She had
                        been unhappy because she was alone, terribly alone; but now she was unhappy
                        because she had discovered that she was in bondage, surrounded by walls, a
                        slave. And now that she yearned for the icy sense of isolation with which
                        she had lived a few weeks back, as a prisoner in a fortress might yearn for
                        the desert, she found also that she could no longer drift on indifferent,
                        enduring the present, and hoping for the future. She could no longer vaguely
                        say to<pb n="312" xml:id="VAB7108-309"/> herself, as she had so often said
                        before, that Hamlin might be redeemed, that he might yet become once more an
                        object of her love: for it had become plain to her that her future was
                        settled; that whatever Hamlin was, he was her master, her proprietor; and
                        that, lovable or not lovable to her nature, he expected, counted upon her
                        love.</p>
                    <p>This new feeling made Anne’s life—that life which was so completely a life of
                        the world within, not of the world without—insupportable in a new way.
                        Isolated she could live, but not caged. Her whole soul sickened; she no
                        longer thought of trying to influence Hamlin, of trying to help others; all
                        her energies were concentrated upon helping, upon freeing herself.</p>
                    <p>“There is something the matter with Anne Brown,” said Sacha one day to her
                        cousin. “What is it?”</p>
                    <p>“Miss Brown always looks very serious,” answered Hamlin, affecting
                        indifference. “She has a tragic sort of face even when she is quite<pb n="313" xml:id="VAB7108-310"/> happy. It is one of her great
                        peculiarities, and to me her charms; but for some time I could not realise
                        that she was really happy.”</p>
                    <p>“That’s not it,” cried Madame Elaguine, impatiently. “I know Anne when she’s
                        happy and Anne when she’s unhappy. She doesn’t look merely grave and tragic
                        as she used to—she looks perplexed, and pained, and worried; she’s not happy
                        in her life.”</p>
                    <p>“Miss Brown,” said Edmund Lewis, in his drawling, clammy voice, fixing his
                        conquering eyes on Madame Elaguine with a quiet, insolent smile—“Miss Brown
                        is a woman, although she looks like a goddess; and even goddesses, you know,
                        could not help being women too.”</p>
                    <p>The Russian laughed. “Always the fatuity of these men!” she cried, and turned
                        contemptuously on her heel.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin did not answer, but a feeling of satisfaction came over him. Anne was
                        unhappy; and in a nature like hers, he said to himself, love must be
                        unhappiness. But when he saw Lewis and his cousin alone he felt<pb n="314" xml:id="VAB7108-311"/> annoyed; and he fell upon their spiritualistic
                        practices with a perfect rabidness of scorn.</p>
                    <p>Anne little knew that she was watched; she did not care what might or might
                        not be thought of her by Sacha Elaguine, by Chough, by Edmund Lewis, by any
                        of these people whom she despised; and as to Hamlin, an instinct told her
                        that he would never guess what it was that troubled her. So Anne kept her
                        pain to herself; but sometimes the despair of being thus enslaved became too
                        strong for endurance, and she longed for some one to whom to confide it.
                        Every word, every look, every piece of attention, every show of indifference
                        on Hamlin’s part, seemed to mean the same thing: that he expected her to
                        love him—everything seemed to allude and point to that. The only women with
                        whom she was at all really intimate were the Leighs; but Anne could not say
                        a word to them, could not ask their advice. She could never, she thought,
                        make either of these girls enter into her situation, comprehend her
                        feelings, make<pb n="315" xml:id="VAB7108-312"/> her understand that she was
                        not ungrateful, and that Hamlin was not ungenerous. Yet she felt the
                        terrible need of some one to counsel her—to take some of the frightful
                        responsibility either of ingratitude or of degradation from off her—to show
                        her either how to get out of the situation, or how to submit to it. Such a
                        person there was—a person who might help her, who might even understand her;
                        but something told Anne that she must not have recourse to him, to her
                        cousin Dick. Perhaps it was vanity, perhaps a knowledge that Richard Brown
                        would triumph over this miserable ending to what he had always opposed; a
                        fear lest he might misunderstand Hamlin, and bespatter what was the one
                        beautiful thing in his life—his raising up of Anne. For it was a curious
                        point that, contemptible as Hamlin had become to Anne, and unworthy in her
                        own eyes of her love, she could not endure the idea of any one else
                        understanding this, of any one else attacking Hamlin. None of them, she
                        felt, could understand what<pb n="316" xml:id="VAB7108-313"/> Hamlin had
                        done for her; what he had been—nay, what, as a beloved piece of the past, he
                        still was—to her; only she could measure what she owed to him, and only she,
                        therefore, might weigh the bad in him against the good. For even when she
                        was most overcome with the sense of the moral prison which was closing round
                        her, to cripple her life and break her spirit, Anne could not wish that the
                        past had been otherwise—that she had never met Hamlin, never contracted a
                        debt towards him, never loved him. Bleak and dark as might be the present,
                        she would not ever have given up that past,—that sudden flaming up of her
                        life, that one spell of hope and trustfulness, and admiration and love,
                        which must serve her for all her existence: to have had that was always
                        sweet, to have been given it was always a reason for gratitude. Moreover,
                        Anne could not now contemplate what she would have been had she never met
                        Hamlin. To her stern and idealising nature, to have remained without
                        knowledge, <choice>

                        </choice> responsibility, without sympathy, without sense of right or wrong,
                        morally only half developed, only half alive, as she had been during her
                        earlier girlhood, was unendurable. She would not, for all the pain and
                        humiliation which it might cost her, have forfeited the finer fibre, the
                        clearer vision which had shown her that she was indebted therefor to a man
                        whom she despised. No; she could not, even in thought, relinquish the past.
                        But what of the future? The question laid hold of Anne’s mind, and for some
                        weeks rode it like an incubus. How many of us have thus let a hopeless
                        problem get hold of our whole nature, and make it move, day after day, week
                        after week, in the frightful treadmill of its vicious circle?</p>
                    <p>Every night Anne lay down to sleep with her doubts half solved, her mind half
                        made up, only to wake up the next day with all her doubts reinforced and all
                        her resolutions scattered. Such a condition is not due to weakness or
                        indecision of character; nay, it is<pb n="318" xml:id="VAB7108-315"/>
                        probably only the earnest minds, the most capable of serious decisions, who
                        can thus go on living in suspense, resisting the temptation of a decision,
                        enduring the monotonous recurrence of a struggle of motives and of thought;
                        it is the effort, this frightful mental instability, at retaining moral life
                        where life would easily be extinguished; it is the weary tramp up and down
                        with cold cramped limbs of the prisoner who knows that were he to stop, were
                        he to lie down, he would have rest, but also death. Almost unintentionally
                        Anne kept asking herself what steps she could take to be free. She used, in
                        moments of weakness and weariness of heart, to go over schemes of
                        independence, to indulge in day‐dreams of self‐supporting liberty. She who,
                        a few months ago, had dreamed of raising the lower classes, of spreading
                        higher knowledge and ideals among them, of awakening the more fortunate
                        parts of society to their sense of responsibility,—she whose whole energy
                        had been taken up in silent projects for bettering, no matter how<pb n="319" xml:id="VAB7108-316"/> little, the world, bettering the poor by making
                        them think and enjoy, bettering the rich by making them feel; giving the
                        shop‐girls of the Women’s Club a glimpse into the world of imagination, and
                        giving Hamlin a glimpse into the world of reality,—she was now thinking of
                        how she might earn her bread, how she might live as a teacher or a
                        governess. Talking with the Leighs and her cousin, she used shyly, and with
                        a desire to deceive very foreign to her, to put questions, seemingly purely
                        abstract, as to what a poor girl with a certain amount of education could
                        best do—as to what was required of a schoolmistress or a governess. And,
                        while telling herself that it was all useless—that she was bound by the
                        past, however much she might try and cut herself loose from the present—Anne
                        mechanically gave her time to studying, no longer to be more worthy of
                        Hamlin, or more useful in the world, but to enable herself to gain a
                        livelihood if . . . Ah! well, when she asked herself plainly what that “if”
                            meant,<pb n="320" xml:id="VAB7108-317"/> she had to answer that she
                        scarcely knew: if the slave‐owner should say to his slave,“ Go—I am tired of
                        you;” if the man who had bought the precious statue or picture should weary
                        of it and wish to exchange it. And Anne had to admit to herself that Hamlin
                        was not the man to feel or act like this. Nay sometimes, when she had
                        indulged in a day‐dream of freedom—when she had let herself go to the vain
                        belief that Hamlin would one day awaken to the sense that this woman was not
                        his ideal, as she had awakened to the sense that he was not hers—when she
                        had worked out the details of her half‐starving life of independence, her
                        return to her old drudgery (but with a freer spirit), her hard struggle as a
                        teacher of little children, or a shop‐girl, or at best a schoolmistress,—the
                        recollection of the past would suddenly overpower her—the recollection of
                        what she had been, what she had hoped—the recollection of her love of that
                        debt which she was now devising a means of paying off,—and poor Anne would
                        burst into tears. But that debt, she<pb n="321" xml:id="VAB7108-318"/> felt,
                        could not be paid off. She might support herself in the future, but how
                        could she get rid of the past? If she lived on dry bread for the rest of her
                        life, Hamlin would still have done for her what she believed that no other
                        man had ever done for a woman; if she could save up every penny of earnings
                        and place before him all that he had ever spent for her education, would it
                        not be the basest, vilest mockery and cheat, and could she repay the love
                        which he had felt, the trustfulness which he had shown? Repay it she never
                        could; for love and trustfulness she could not give in return; and she must
                        ever remain in his debt, remain his to do his bidding. And yet at times the
                        question arose in her, What right had she to pay a debt at the price of her
                        honour? To become Hamlin’s wife when she did not love him, to pretend love
                        which she did not feel, this was in Anne’s eyes, measured by her stern
                        measure of right and wrong, a prostitution; and could it be honourable to
                        let herself be dishonoured? But Anne cast<pb n="322" xml:id="VAB7108-319"/>
                        this thought behind her; Hamlin, by binding only himself and leaving her
                        free, had by his chivalrous generosity really bound her; if to possess her,
                        and as much of her life and love as she could give, would make Hamlin happy,
                        he had a right to it.</p>
                    <p>The strain, Anne felt, was becoming too much for her; this question of her
                        own future, of her own dignity and undignity, was swallowing up her whole
                        nature, neither more nor less than the nature of Hamlin and his friend was
                        swallowed up by their æsthetical feelings. Anne recognised, with terror,
                        that she was deteriorating; that she was beginning to care nothing for
                        others in this preoccupation about herself; and that such a thing should
                        happen—that she too should lose her more generous feelings—was a greater
                        degradation than any other which could come over her. This shame and this
                        misfortune alone it was in her power to prevent, and she determined to
                        prevent it. She did her best to put aside all questions of her own future,
                        to accustom herself to wait for<pb n="323" xml:id="VAB7108-320"/> what might
                        happen, what she might be summoned to do, and she threw herself with more
                        ardour than ever (trying to escape from the contamination, not merely, as
                        before, of the selfishness of others, but of her own) into such studies and
                        questions as concerned wider interests than her own.</p>
                    <p>Anne’s earnest nature, lacking the happy faculty of being absorbed by present
                        feelings, had always been very subject to a dull moral pain at the evil in
                        the world, storms from the great Sahara of misery which would lower over her
                        own oasis of happiness, clogging its atmosphere and blighting its greenness.
                        But now her efforts not to brood over her own unhappiness, resulted merely
                        in her brooding almost unceasingly over the unhappiness of others. And
                        gradually, to the sense of the misery of the world, became superadded the
                        terrible sense of the injustice of that world’s arrangements: from being
                        indignant with the callousness of men, Anne became indignant, with the same
                        cold and sombre indignation,<pb n="324" xml:id="VAB7108-321"/> at the
                        callousness of God. She felt herself alone, isolated, separated not only
                        from the men and women surrounding her, but separated in spirit from the
                        whole scheme of things. And to her, the greater part of whose life was in
                        her aspirations, this gradual removal of anything to which to aspire, this
                        gradual destruction of every ideal with which to sympathise, such a
                        condition of moral loneliness was, as Anne once said to her cousin, worse
                        than death.</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown had somehow, that day, been more sympathising with Anne than
                        usual. Had she not been too much engrossed, she might have noticed that he
                        watched her face, listened to her words, not merely now with gentleness and
                        friendliness, but with a kind of suppressed admiration and wonder.</p>
                    <p>“Nothing is so bad as death,” answered Richard; “because, once dead, we can
                        no longer feel, we can no longer judge, or sympathise, or strive.”</p>
                    <p>Anne looked up from the frock which she<pb n="325" xml:id="VAB7108-322"/> was
                        making for one of the little Choughs, whose wardrobe was getting into a
                        lamentable condition.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t mean that we are so useful when we are dead, but we are less
                        unhappy. You talk of feeling, and sympathising, and judging, and striving:
                        what can we feel, and sympathise with, and judge, except the miserableness
                        of men, and their weakness and badness, and the horrible arrangement of the
                        world which makes them such? and after what can we strive, except vainly to
                        release ourselves from that abominable order of the world?”</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown looked at Anne for a moment in silence. He was a singularly
                        unæsthetic man, and confusing beauty with mere utility, he had never well
                        understood the beauty which artistic people chose to see in this strange,
                        uncommon, sombre face, so unlike that of any one else, and which seemed to
                        have no prototype either in man or woman. But now he felt that Anne was
                        beautiful, and very beautiful.</p>
                    <pb n="326" xml:id="VAB7108-323"/>
                    <p>“All mankind is gradually releasing itself from what you call this evil
                        arrangement of the world,” he answered; “or rather, the very perception that
                        such an arrangement is evil is teaching mankind,—I mean all that much of
                        mankind which makes the rest move on, to rearrange the world, and out of the
                        bad to make the good.”</p>
                    <p>Anne shrugged her shoulders contemptuously.</p>
                    <p>“Why was the arrangement made if it was evil?” she asked.</p>
                    <p>“Because,” said her cousin, watching her face as he let his words
                        drop—“because there was no sense of good and evil at the beginning; because
                        it is only man who has conceived that the pleasure of others is good, and
                        the pain of others is evil; and because, therefore, only man can be expected
                        to reorganise the world so that the good of others be sought and the evil of
                        others avoided. It is only man living with men, and feeling their miseries
                        in his own, and their happiness in his own, who can be<pb n="327" xml:id="VAB7108-324"/> anxious for justice and impatient of injustice.
                        How can you expect it of nature?”</p>
                    <p>Anne did not answer, but remained for a moment with her hands folded over her
                        work, looking out of the window. Outside there was only yellow fog, and
                        leafless spectral branches; yet her onyx‐grey eyes opened slowly, as if she
                        were taking in some faint but glorious vision.</p>
                    <p>“What right have you to expect such feelings except from men and women?” went
                        on Brown; “the gods, you know, have other things to do. I suppose,” he added
                        bitterly, “that they had a godlike life like their representatives, the
                        poets and artists, on earth, creating only for their amusement, and keeping
                        every disagreeable sight, or sound, or feeling, or suspicion away from
                        them.”</p>
                    <p>Anne was accustomed to such hits at Hamlin; they were too true to be refuted,
                        and too spiteful to be accepted; and now she was too much absorbed to notice
                        any of them.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t know exactly what you are driving<pb n="328" xml:id="VAB7108-325"/>
                        at, Dick,” she said. “I don’t understand your theory about man and God, and
                        right and wrong; it is misty to me. But still it seems—I don’t know how—as
                        if, could I only understand it, it would make a great difference to me.”</p>
                    <p>“It must make a great difference to every honest person. You have no
                        religion, Anne.”</p>
                    <p>“No. I thought religion was all bosh; merely a sort of silly pretty delusion,
                        like love and all that;” and Anne thought bitterly how her own only
                        religion, her love for Hamlin, her desire to become worthy of his goodness,
                        had lamentably betrayed her.</p>
                    <p>“Without religion life is death,” said Brown, with his positivistic
                        solemnity.</p>
                    <p>Anne looked at him contemptuously; she had so often heard people talk
                        solemnly like that. Did not Hamlin talk in that way about the religion of
                        beauty, and Dennistoun about the religion of love, by which he meant
                        lust?</p>
                    <p>“It is all very fine; but I don’t much <choice>
                            <orig>be‐<pb n="329" xml:id="VAB7108-326"/> lieve</orig>
                            <reg>believe</reg>
                        </choice> in religions. There is nothing worth worshipping; all is fetish,
                        at best half silver and half clay.”</p>
                    <p>“You don’t believe in any religion, Anne, because you have never tried to
                        find one.”</p>
                    <p>“I have looked in the Gospel, and in the ‘Imitation of Christ,’ and in my own
                        heart, Dick; and what I have found there is ignored in the scheme on which
                        the world is made; because I have read there of love and justice and mercy,
                        and I have not found the love and justice and mercy which presided over
                        creation.”</p>
                    <p>“I told you that the world was not made by man, and that it is man who has
                        conceived good and evil. I always told you, Anne, that it was a great pity
                        that you should read only books upon details of science, like political
                        economy and so forth, and refuse to get general ideas of what is and what is
                        not the belief of our age.”</p>
                    <p>“Detail knowledge—I mean knowledge of political economy and physiology and so
                        forth—is useful; it can be applied, it can serve to<pb n="330" xml:id="VAB7108-327"/> make people a little less wretched. What is the
                        use of your general ideas? Oh, I know; the religion of truth, the worship of
                        ideas, &amp;c., &amp;c. I don’t see that it is a bit nobler to
                        worship truth than to worship beauty; your religion of science is only
                        another form of selfish æstheticism: your friends hanker after knowledge, as
                        my friends hanker after beautiful pictures, and music, and poetry, and
                        women; and as my people dignify their appetites with the name of religion of
                        beauty, so do yours sanctify theirs as the worship of truth. All that merely
                        makes the world more cold and black in my eyes.”</p>
                    <p>“These general ideas,” answered Brown, “are what prevent me from being as
                        wretched as you are. Do you call that useless?”</p>
                    <p>“That is just what Mr Hamlin says about beauty, and Chough about the Eternal
                        Feminine. But I don’t see that the world gains by this devotion.”</p>
                    <p>“I know nothing of Hamlin’s or Chough’s<pb n="331" xml:id="VAB7108-328"/>
                        opinions,” interrupted Brown, impatiently; “but I know that if you permit
                        yourself to continue in this kind of pessimism you will enervate your soul,
                        Anne. It seems very noble and austere, and all that sort of bosh; but there
                        is just the same fascination in it as there is in any morbid excitement, and
                        just the same debasement of the individual in indulging therein.”</p>
                    <p>His words seemed to go through Anne. Was she becoming selfish, weak,
                        self‐indulgent? The terror of it sickened her. And was everything, however
                        noble it seemed—love, beauty, nay, even her indignation at the world’s
                        evil—only a snare?</p>
                    <p>“Will you teach me, Dick?” she said, after a moment. “I don’t much believe in
                        your religion—positivism, I suppose it is—for all religions seem to me to
                        turn out, oh, so empty, after promising so much. But if you will tell me, or
                        give me books to read, you know I will do my best to understand.”</p>
                    <p>“You are a noble girl, Anne,” said Brown<pb n="332" xml:id="VAB7108-329"/>
                        half audibly, fixing his eyes on Anne’s. “I did not think there was a woman
                        so strong, and truthful, and fair‐minded as you—well—in the whole
                        world.”</p>
                    <p>“You always think people base, Dick,” she answered sadly. “It is a wretched
                        mistake, but not so bad a one for yourself as always to think them
                        noble.”</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown lent Anne a number of books, and he often came of an evening
                        when Hamlin was gone to Madame Elaguine’s spiritual <foreign xml:lang="fre">séances</foreign> (for despite his scepticism he found himself
                        attracted by the mysticism with which Edmund Lewis had easily infected his
                        cousin), and talked them over with her. He took her also to hear the
                        lectures of a friend of his, a red‐haired young man of genius, dying of
                        consumption, who had for truth and righteousness a passion such as other men
                        may have for sport, and who was the chief preacher of the secular and
                        scientific religion with which Brown was imbued, and with which he was
                        seeking to imbue Anne. Anne<pb n="333" xml:id="VAB7108-330"/> was not so
                        quick in being converted as her cousin had expected; she was slow of
                        thought, and her earnestness, her honesty, perhaps also a painful
                        remembrance of so many other deluded hopes, made her sceptical. But, little
                        by little, Anne was converted; and, as her cousin had foretold, she was
                        happier. The world and its contradictions became simpler in her eyes, and
                        she became once more confident of good. Moreover, what Brown never guessed,
                        her new faith in the triumph of right, her new belief in the necessity of
                        doing one’s duty for the sake of mankind and of progress, had at once given
                        her a more serene determination to accomplish her duty towards Hamlin; and,
                        what was more important, it had taken away her thoughts a little from her
                        own position of impotence and isolation and probable degradation. And
                        perhaps, unconsciously also to Anne, she felt less isolated now: she felt as
                        if in this rough, brutal, vain philanthropist, who was so honest, for all
                        his petty vanity, and who was so desirous<pb n="334" xml:id="VAB7108-331"/>
                        of her good, despite all his former contemptuousness, she had gained what
                        she had never had, and had yet always vaguely wanted,—some one for her to
                        understand and to understand her, to help and be helped by—not an ideal
