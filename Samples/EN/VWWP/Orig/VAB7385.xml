                <p>H<hi rend="sc">AVE</hi> you ever been to Wales? I do not ask this question of any one in particular;
                    I merely address it to the universal British public, or, rather, to such member or members of the
                    same as shall be wise enough to sit down and read the ensuing true and moving love story—true as the
                    loves of wicked Abelard and Heloise, moving as those of good Paul and Virginia. Probably those wise
                    ones will be very few; numerable by tens, or even units: they will, I may very safely aver, not form
                    the bulk of the nation. However high may be my estimate of my own powers of narration, however amply
                    Providence may have gifted me with self-appreciation, I may be sure of that, seeing that the only
                    books I know of which enjoy so wide a circulation are the Prayer-book and Bradshaw. I am not going
                    to instruct any one in religion or trains, so I may as well make up my mind to a more limited
                    audience, while I pipe my simple lay (rather squeakily and out of tune, perhaps), and may think
                    myself very lucky if that same kind, limited audience do not hiss me down before I have got through
                    half a dozen staves of the dull old ditty.</p>
                <p>Have you ever been to Wales? If you have ever visited <pb n="2" xml:id="VAB7385-006"/> the pretty,
                    dirty, green spot where Pat and his brogue, where potatoes and absenteeism and head-centres
                    flourish, <hi rend="i">alias</hi> Ireland, you have no doubt passed through a part of it, rushing
                    by, most likely, in the Irish mail; but in that case your eyes and nose and ears were all so very
                    full of dust and cinders—you were so fully employed in blinking and coughing and enjoying the poetry
                    of motion—as to be totally incapable of seeing, hearing, or smelling any of the beauties, agreeable
                    noises, or good smells, which in happier circumstances might have offered themselves to your notice.
                    Perhaps you are in the habit, every midsummer, of taking your half-dozen male and female olive
                    shoots to have the roses restored to their twelve fat cheeks by blowy scrambles about the great
                    frowning Orme's Head, or by excavations in the Rhyl Sands. Perhaps you have gone wedding-touring to
                    Llanberis on the top of a heavy-laden coach, swinging unsafely round sharp corners, and nearly
                    flinging your Angelina from your side on to the hard Welsh road below. Perhaps you have wept with
                    Angelina at the spurious grave of the martyred Gelert, or eaten pink trout voraciously at Capel
                    Curig, and found out what a startlingly good appetite Angelina had. But have you ever lived in the
                    land of the Cymri? Have you ever seen how drunk the masculine Cymri can be on market days, or what
                    grievous old hags the feminine Cymri become towards their thirtieth year? have you ever, by bitter
                    experience, discovered the truth of that couplet—</p>

                <p>I <hi rend="i">have</hi> lived in Wales, so I speak with authority; and for my part I don't think
                    that Taffy is much more given to the breaking of the eighth commandment than the <hi rend="i"
                            ><foreign xml:lang="fr">canaille</foreign></hi> of any other country. He is not a bright
                    fellow, is not Taffy; <pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7385-007"/> happiest, I think, when rather tipsy, or when
                    yelling psalms in his conventicle or schism-shop—for Taffy is addicted to schism; he will tell you
                    plenty of lies, too, and will not season them with the salt of a racy, devil-me-care wit, as Pat
                    would. But he is very civil-spoken, and rather harmless; seldomer, I think, than his cleverer
                    neighbour over the border does he hanker feloniously after his neighbour's spoons, or hammer his
                    wife's head with the domestic poker.</p>
                <p>But why am I drivelling on, like a sort of Murray and water, on the manners and character of this, to
                    my thinking, not very interesting nation? I will waste no more <distinct>"prave 'ords"</distinct>
                    upon them, as the few men and women whom I am going to tell you about, and whom I shall want you to
                    like a little, or dislike a little, as the case may be, are not Taffies, only they happen to have
                    stuck up their tent-poles in Taffy-land when they first make their low bow to you. These men and
                    women were nothing out of the way for goodness, or beauty, or talent; they did a hundred thousand
                    naughty things, each one of them. Some of them did them with impunity, as far as this world goes;
                    some of them, capricious Megæra and Tisyphone lashed with scorpions for their derelictions. This is
                    going to be neither a "Life of Saints," nor a "History of Devils;" these are memoirs neither of a
                    "Hedley Vicars," nor of a "Dame aux Camellias;" so, whoso expects and relishes either of those
                    styles of composition may forthwith close this volume, and pitch it (if it be his own, and not the
                    battered property of a circulating library) into the fire. Those who love a violent moral, or
                    violent judgment for sins and follies—a man struck dead for saying "damn," or a woman for going to a
                    ball, as the <hi rend="i">Record</hi> would charitably have us believe is the way of
                    Providence—equally with those who enjoy the flavour of violent immorality, will be disappointed if
                    they look this way for the gratification of their peculiar idiosyncracies. <pb n="4"
                        xml:id="VAB7385-008"/> Of my friends presently to be made known to you, and criticised by you,
                    "the more part remain unto this present, but some have fallen asleep."</p>
                <p>Once upon a time—I like that old, time-honoured opening; it makes one so nobly free, gives one so
                    much room to stretch one's wings in, ties one down to no king's reign, no hampering, clogging
                    century—once upon a time there was a valley in Taffy-land; there is still, unless some very recent
                    convulsion has upheaved it to the top of a mountain, or submerged it beneath the big Atlantic waves;
                    a valley lovelier than that one in " Ida," where <quote>"beautiful Paris, evil-hearted
                        Paris,"</quote> pastured his sheep and his jet-black goats, and inaugurated his rakish course; a
                    valley where there are no dangerous, good-looking Parises, only one or two red-headed Welsh squires,
                    who have each married, or will in the fulness of time each marry, one lawful wife—red-headed, too,
                    very likely; and have never made, will never make, love to any Enones or other ill-conducted young
                    shepherdesses. In fact, in that Arcadia there are no such shepherdesses; the daughters of the Cymri
                    do not <quote>"ply the homely shepherd's trade,"</quote> nor would they shed much romance over it if
                    they did; for with sorrow be it spoken, blowsy are they mostly, hard-featured, toothless; and,
                    moreover, the little nimble, lean sheep that go scrambling and jumping and skurrying about the rough
                    crags and steep hill-sides do not need any crook'd and melodious Dowsabellas or Neæras to look after
                    them and guide them in the way they should go.</p>
                <p>In that valley there are plenty of houses, squires' houses and peasants' houses, where the
                    propagation of the Cambrian is conducted with much success; houses big and little, red-faced and
                    white-faced and dirty-faced, old and new. But we have at present to do with only one of those
                    houses, and it comes under the head of the littles and the olds. Halfway <pb n="5"
                        xml:id="VAB7385-009"/> up a hill-side it stands, looking across the valley to other higher hills
                    that swell out softly against the sky, and go sloping gently down to the sea twenty miles away. They
                    always remind me—I don't know why—of the distant hills in Martin's picture of the "Plains of
                    Heaven;" so mistily do they rise in their hazy blueness. It is a snug, unpretending little house
                    enough, with its black and white cross-beamed front and unwalled kitchen-garden straggling steeply
                    up the slope at the back. Many and many a day has it stood there, seeing generations and fashions
                    come in and go out; has stood there since the far-away days when men wore curly wigs half-way down
                    their backs, and sky-blue coats, and fought and died for prerogative and King Charles, or fought and
                    lived for England and liberty: when most houses were black and white, like its little elderly self,
                    before plate glass or stucco, or commodious villa residences, five minutes' walk from a station,
                    were dreamed of. The name of the little house is Glan-yr-Afon.</p>

                <p>"<persName corresp="#jcraven">J<hi rend="sc">ACK</hi></persName> and I got in our last hayload
                    to-day, without a drop of rain; the first bit of good luck that has come to us, I don't know when.
                    If we had any land, I should imagine that we must have a bit of consecrated ground among it, to
                    account for our ill-fortune; but as we have not of our own enough to pasture a goose upon, that
                    cannot be it. Such an odd thing happened to-day—<persName corresp="#rbrandon">Robert
                        Brandon</persName> proposed to me: it is the first offer I ever had, though I was seventeen last
                    month. If it is never a more pleasant process than it was to-day, I hope sincerely it may be the
                    last. I said 'Yes,' too; at least, a species of Yes after half-a-dozen Noes; I cannot imagine why,
                    for I certainly did not <pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7385-010"/> feel Yes. I suppose I must have been
                    pleased at any one wishing for my company during the term of his natural life."</p>
                <p>The name on the fly-leaf of this journal-book is <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther
                        Craven</persName>, Glan-yr-Afon, and the date <date>July 10, 186—</date>. July is very often a
                    rather wet month—not so this year; all through its one-and-thirty days the sky was like brass, as it
                    looked to Elijah (the Seer's) eyes on the top of Carmel, when, by his faith, he brought up the
                    tarrying rain from the sea's chambers. London is pouring out her noble army of haberdashers and
                    greengrocers into Ramsgate and Margate, and Scarborough and Llandudno. The John Gilpins of to-day
                    are not satisfied with a modest outing to the "Bell" at Edmonton, <quote>"all in a chaise and
                        pair."</quote></p>
                <p>Armies of schoolboys are devouring arid sandwiches and prime old buns in railway refreshment
                    rooms—schoolboys emptied out of every school and seminary and college all over the country. Highly
                    paid instructors of youth are stretching their cramped legs up the steep sides of Helvellyn and Mont
                    Blanc, and surveying the "frozen hurricane" of the glaciers through their academic spectacles. And
                    young <persName corresp="#jcraven">Craven</persName>'s (of Glan-yr-Afon) last hayload is safely
                    stacked, as you heard from his sister's diary. This morning the highest lying of the upland fields
                    was hilly with haycocks: to-night it is as flat as Salisbury Plain. All day long the waggons have
                    gone grinding and crunching up and down the rocky mountain road between field and rick-yard. All day
                    long Evan and Hugh and Roppert (<hi rend="i">sic</hi>) with their waistcoats open and their brown
                    arms bared, aided and abetted by various Cambrian matrons, with bonnets standing upright on their
                    heads, and pitchforks in their lily hands, have been tossing the scented bundles—sweeter in death
                    than in life, like a good man's fame—into the carts; loading them till of the shaft horse nought but
                    ears and nose and forelegs appeared, save to the eye of faith. All day long <pb n="7"

                    <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> has been sitting under a haycock, as one might fancy
                    Solomon's wise woman doing, <quote>"looking well to the ways of her household."</quote> The hay
                    moulds itself pliably into a soft arm-chair for her young, slight figure, and the big hay-spiders
                    walk up her back at their leisure, and explore the virgin forests of her thick dusk hair. She has
                    had her luncheon brought out to her there—bread and milk in a white bowl. It is unsocial, surly
                    work, eating alone; one feels reduced to the level of a dog, cracking bones, and lapping up gravy
                    out of his trencher, all by himself, with tail well down, like a pump handle, and a growl and a snap
                    for any brother dog who may approach to share his feast.</p>
                <p>The haymakers were much cheerier—<quote>"couched at ease"</quote> under the nutty hedgerow, bringing
                    slices of unnaturally fat bacon out of blue and white spotted pocket-handkerchiefs, gabbling to one
                    another in the Welsh tongue, which, to one who occupies the room of the unlearned, has always a
                    querulous, quarrelsome, interrogative sound, and digging their clasp knives into the ground to clean
                    them, when their services were no longer required. <persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName> is
                    out for the day, and the place feels stupid without him. There is not much melody in "I paddle my
                    own canoe," but one misses it when one is accustomed to hear it echoing gaily over the crofts and
                    through the farm-yard and orchard. It would be impossible to talk more dog-Welsh than <persName
                        corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName> does to his workmen; but even the mellifluous tongue of the
                    Cymri, with its three or four consonants standing together, undissevered by any vowel, is made
                    harmonious, enunciated by a young, clear voice, that sounds as if it had never been the vehicle for
                    sorrowful words. <quote>
                        <l rend="ti-3">"The village seems asleep or dead,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-3">Now Lubin is away,"</l>
                    </quote> and <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>, though she has entered upon her
                    eighteenth year (an age which a century ago would have been rather <pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7385-012"/>
                    overripe—Chloe and Cynthia and Phyllis being considered in their prime at fifteen, and toasted
                    accordingly), has as yet no Lubin but her brother. Now and again, Gwen the cook, and Sarah the
                    housemaid, came panting up the hill in lilac cotton gowns and trim white aprons, bearing beer in
                    every jug and mug and tin pipkin that Glan-yr-Afon affords, as Evangeline brought the nut-brown ale
                    to the reapers of the village of Grand Pré. And the haymakers drink insatiably, and wipe the thirsty
                    mouth upon the convenient sleeve as artless Nature bids. By-and-by artless Nature makes them rather
                    unsteady on their legs. As they lead the heavy-laden cart to the last remaining haycock, the one on
                    which their mistress sits enthroned, I am not at all sure that they do not see two haycocks, two
                    wide-leaved white hats, two <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>s. Perceiving their
                    condition, though too old an inhabitant of Wales to be in any degree surprised at what is, after
                    all, the normal condition of the Welsh, <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName> rises
                    precipitately. Driven from her fortress, she picks up her needles and threads, and <persName
                        corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName>'s shirt, from which, as usual, the frequent button is
                    missing, and runs lightly down the mountain path in her strong country boots, which bid defiance to
                    the sharp stones that crop out at every step through the limestone soil. At the hall door—a little
                    arched door like a church's, with a trellised porch and benches, such as one sees Dutch boors
                    sitting on with their beer and schnapps, in Teniers' pictures—<persName corresp="#sarah"
                        >Sarah</persName> meets her. <persName corresp="#sarah">Sarah</persName> is an Englishwoman.</p>

                        would never be a bit the wiser."</said></p>
                <p>Half-an-hour passes, and <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Mr. Brandon</persName> is still in the
                    "parlour." It is seven o'clock, and dinner-time. Would you so long in saying, and whether it is
                    anything likely to reconcile <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName> to the loss of her
                    dinner? A little room that looks towards the sun-setting; a little room full of evening sunshine and
                    the smell of tea-roses; a light paper, with small, bright flower-bunches on the walls; white muslin
                    curtains; a general air of crisp freshness, as of a room that there are no climbing, crawling,
                    sticky-fingered children to crumple and rumple. A young woman, rather red in the face, standing in
                    one corner. She has been driven thither apparently by a young man, who is standing before her, and
                    who is still redder. At a rough calculation, you would say that the young man was seven feet high;
                    but put him with his back against the wall, with his heels together, and his chin in, and you will
                    find that he is exactly six feet four; that is, four inches taller than any man who wishes to do
                    work in the world, and find horses to carry him, ought to be. His clothes are rather shabby, and he
                    looks poor; but, from the crown of his close-clipped head to the sole of his big feet, a gentleman,
                    every inch of him, though he has no <quote>"gude braid claith"</quote> to help to make him so. His
                    features may be Apollo's or Apollyon's, for all you can see of them, so thickly are they planted out
                    with a forest of yellow hair; but tears do not seem to be at any immense distance from eyes blue as
                    the sky between storm clouds, fearless as a three-years' child's.</p>

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Don't you think that we do very well as we are?"</said> says the young woman,
                    suggestively.</p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"I don't know about you, I'm sure. I know I've lost a stone and a half within

                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> laughs. <said who="#ecraven">"There is some little of
                        you left still,"</said> she says, with rather a mischievous glance up at the two yards and a
                    half of enamoured manhood before her.</p>
                <p>This is what has been over-roasting the mutton. He has been asking her to take his heart, his large
                    hand, and the half of one hundred and twenty pounds a year (the exorbitant pay of a lieutenant in
                    Her Majesty's infantry), of an old hunting watch, and a curly retriever dog; and she has been
                    declining these tempting offers, one and all. The minute hand of the gilt clock, on which Minerva
                    sits in a helmet and a very tight gown, with her legs dangling down, has travelled from 6.30 to 7.5,
                    and within these five-and-thirty minutes <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName> has
                    refused three proposals, all made by the same person: the first, very stoutly and mercilessly, from
                        <persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName>'s arm-chair, where she had originally taken up her
                    position; the second, decisively still, but with less cruelty, from the music-stool, to which she
                    had next retired; and the third, in a hasty and wavering manner, from the corner, in which she has
                    taken final refuge, in a strong, fortified entrenchment behind the writing-table.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"But—but—"</said> says <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>, her
                    rebellious mouth giving little twitches every now and then as at some lurking thought of the

                        that you were here, I thought that, of course, you had come to say something about that

                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"Didn't I?"</said> answers the young giant, with a crestfallen look. <said

                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"I know what an unequal exchange it is that I am offering,"</said> says
                        <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Brandon</persName>, too humble to resent, and yet with a dim sense
                    of mortification at the quantity and quality of praise bestowed upon him. <said who="#rbrandon">"I
                        know of how much more value you are than I!"</said></p>
                <p>She does not contradict him; her own heart echoes his words. <said who="#ecraven">"I am of more value

                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"That was why I was in such a hurry to speak,"</said> he says eagerly. <said

                        else."</said></p>
                <p>She laughs rather grimly. <said who="#ecraven">"You might have laid aside your alarms on that head, I

                <p>Silence for a few minutes: <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> takes up a penwiper,
                    fashioned into a remote resemblance to a chimney sweep, and studies its anatomy attentively. <said
                        who="#ecraven">"Shall I upset the writing-table and make a rush past him? No, the ink <pb n="12"

                <p>Whether mindful or not of the fate of Gibbon the historian, who, having thrown himself on his knees

                        <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> apprehended. He stands quiet, cramming half a
                    yard of yellow beard into his mouth, and says presently:</p>

                    three."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"It's very disagreeable, I'm sure,"</said> says Esther, wrinkling up her

                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"Try me!"</said> he says very eagerly, stretching out his hand across the

                        of thing to do; and, besides, I should have my mother left to live for if the worst came to the
                        worst; but you must see that it is everything in the world to a fellow to have one great hope in
                        it to keep him straight."</said></p>
                <p>Soft music in the distance; some one whistling "I paddle my own canoe" somewhere about the house;
                        <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>, in an agony between the fear of subversing the
                    table, and the hundredfold worse fear of being discovered by <persName corresp="#jcraven"
                        >Jack</persName> in an unequivocally sentimental position, of which she would never hear the
                    last. <said who="#ecraven">"Very well, very well, I'll—I'll <hi rend="i">think</hi> about it; could
                        you be so very kind as to loose my hand?"</said></p>
                <p>He complies reluctantly, and she, that there may be no <pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7385-017"/> further
                    discussion about it, hides it discreetly away in her jacket pocket. "I paddle my own canoe" dies
                    away in the distance; apparently it was on its way to dress for dinner. Esther draws a sigh of
                    relief. <said who="#ecraven">"I thought that some one was coming."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"And if they had?"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Why, I did not relish the idea of being found driven into a corner, like a
                        child at a dame's school, and you, like the dame, standing over me,"</said> answers she,
                    abandoning the struggle with the corners of her mouth, and bubbling over with the facile laughter of
                    seventeen. Utterly unable to join in her merriment, he stands leaning in awkward misery against the
                    wall; all other griefs are at least respectable; love-sorrows, alone, are only ludicrous.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"It really is so silly,"</said> says <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName>, presently, compassionate but impatient. <said who="#ecraven">"Do try and get

                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"Easier said than done,"</said> he answers ruefully. <said who="#rbrandon">"I
                        might as well advise you to get the better of your affection for <persName corresp="#jcraven"
                            >Jack</persName>."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"I don't see the parallel,"</said> rejoined she, coldly, feeling as if there was
                    sacrilege in the comparison. <said who="#ecraven">"My love for <persName corresp="#jcraven"
                            >Jack</persName> is a natural instinct, built too upon the foundation of lifelong
                        obligations, endless benefits, countless kindnesses. What kindness have I ever shown you? I
                        sewed a button on your glove once, and once I pinned a rose on your coat."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"I have the rose still."</said></p>
                <p>She says <said who="#ecraven">"Pshaw!"</said> pettishly, and turns away her head.</p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"Perhaps you are afraid of marrying on small means?"</said> suggests <persName
                        corresp="#rbrandon">Brandon</persName>, diffidently, after a while.</p>
                <p>The gentle clatter and click of dishes carried into the dining-room enters faintly through the shut
                    door. <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s heart sinks within her. Is he going to begin
                    all over again?—round and round, like a thunderstorm among hills?</p>

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"And you will console yourself by telling all your friends what a flirt I am,

                <p>He smiles, despite himself. <said who="#rbrandon">"I can hardly promise that."</said></p>

                        always,"</said> says the young fellow, very solemnly; and his eyes go away past her, through the
                    window, and up to the blue sky overhead, as if calling on <pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7385-020"/> the
                    great pale vault to be witness between him and her.</p>
                <p>As for her, her prosaic soul has wandered back to the mutton; she takes the opportunity of his eyes
                    being averted to steal a glance at the clock. Apparently, however, he has eyes in the back of his
                    head, for he says hastily, with rather a pained smile: <said who="#rbrandon">"You are longing for me
                        to go."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">" No—o."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"I ought not to have come at this time of night. I ought to have waited till
                        to-morrow, I know."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"It is rather late."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"But to-morrow seemed such a long time off, that I thought I must know the
                        worst or the best before the sun came up again. I don't quite know which it is now; which is it,
                            <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>?" </said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"It's neither the one nor the other; it's the second best,"</said> she answers,
                    all smiles again at seeing some prospect of her admirer's departure, and forgetting, with youthful
                    heedlessness, the price at which that departure has been bought. <said who="#ecraven">"It is that I
                        really am very much obliged, though, all the same I wish you would think better of it, and that

                <p>So with this half-loaf he goes, passes away through the little wooden porch, that is so low it looks
                    as if it were going to knock his tall head, past the stables, and through the oak woods, home</p>

                <p>As saith that most delicious of love poems that makes us all feel immoral as we read it. It is the
                    hour when chanticleer retires to his perch in the henhouse, lowers his proud tail, sinks his neck
                    into his breast, and goes to sleep between his two fattest wives. It is the hour when animal life
                    and wild humanity retire to bed; the hour when tamed humanity sits down to dinner. The more we
                    advance in civilisation the farther back we push the boundaries of sleep and forgetfulness. When we
                    reach our highest point of culture, I suppose we shall hustle the blessed, the divine Nepenthe, off
                    the face of the earth altogether.</p>
                <p>The dining-room at Glan-yr-Afon is, like the rest of the house, rather small and rather pleasant. It
                    will not dine more than twelve comfortably; it is seldom asked to dine more than two; and these two,
                    being young and void of gluttony, do not spend much of their time in it. In youth the dining-room is
                    not our temple, our sanctuary, our holy of holies, as it often is in riper years. In youth our souls
                    are great, and our bodies slender; in old age our bodies are often great and our souls slender. The
                    one wide open window looks on the gay little garden—the window, all around and about which the
                    climbing convolvulus is blowing great white trumpets. There are two or three pictures on the walls;
                    good ones, though dim and dusty. Thomas Wentworth, Lord Strafford, very dark and haughty and
                    saturnine, in blue grey armour, scowing at whosoever looks at him, as he might have scowled at Pym
                    and Hollis. Erasmus, astute <pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7385-022"/> and lean, in a black skull cap: and
                    Mary, Queen of Scots, very pale and peaky and indistinct, for time has washed and scrubbed all the
                    carmine out of the cheeks and lips that sent Europe mad three centuries ago. An old sheep-dog is
                    lying on the hearth-rug, with his wise old eyes fixed on his master, licking his chops every now and
                    then when he sees some morsel more tempting than ordinary conveyed to another mouth than his.</p>
                <p>This evening Lord Strafford is scowling, Mary Stuart simpering, down upon two people dining together,
                    and on a third person whisking about in a clean cap and an aggressively well-starched print dress in
                    attendance upon them. There is a great pot, full and brimming over with roses—a beanpot our
                    forefathers would have called it—in the middle of the table. They were plucked but half an hour ago,
                    and their faces were still wet with the dew-tears that they wept at being torn away from their
                    brothers and sisters on the old gnarled rose trees up the kitchen-garden walk.</p>
                <p>But the freshest, the sweetest, the largest of the roses is not in the beanpot with the others; it is
                    on a chair by itself; there are no dew-tears on its cheeks, it has no prickles, and its name is
                        <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>.</p>
                <p><said who="#jcraven">"Have some roast chips, <persName corresp="#ecraven">Essie</persName>? I cannot
                        offer you any roast mutton, because there isn't any; I dare say there was an hour ago, but there
                        certainly isn't now."</said></p>

                    moustache, which, like the daguerreotypes of fifteen or sixteen years ago, is only visible at rare
                    intervals in one particular light; and with cheeks and nose and chin and throat all as brown as any
                    berry that ever ripened under the mellow autumn sun.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"It's a fault on the right side, dear boy; it's better than <pb n="19"

                        >Esther</persName>, with a pout which a lover would have thought entrancing, but which a prosaic
                    brother, if he perceived it at all, considered rather a distortion than otherwise.</p>
                <p><said who="#jcraven">"I wish that people would remember that there is a time to call and a time to

                <p>A man may bear the untimely cutting off of his firstborn, the disposition evinced by the wife of his
                    bosom to love his neighbour as himself, the sinking of his little all in the Agra Bank, with
                    resignation and fortitude truly Christian; but what hero, what sage, what archbishop, can stand the
                    over-roasting or under-boiling of his mutton, the burning of his soup, or the wateriness of his
                    potatoes, and bear an <hi rend="i"><foreign xml:lang="la">æquam mentem</foreign>?</hi>"</p>

                                ><hi rend="i">Pas avant</hi></foreign>,"</said> which idiomatic phrase is intended to
                    convey to her brother the indiscreetness of making comments in <persName corresp="#sarah"
                        >Sarah</persName>'s presence on <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Mr. Brandon</persName>'s
                    enormities.</p>
                <p>From long familiarity with the sound, <persName corresp="#sarah">Sarah</persName> has become entirely
                    acquainted with <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s specimen of Parisian French, and
                    always pricks up her ears when it appears on the scene.</p>
                <p>Then they are silent for a little space. One is not apt to say very brilliant things in one's family

                <p>M<hi rend="sc">ORNING</hi> is come again. The sun cannot bear to be long away from his young
                    sweetheart, the earth, so he has come back hasting, with royal pomp, with his crown of gay gold
                    beams on his head, with his flame-cloak about his strong shoulders, and with a great troop of light,
                    flaky clouds—each with a reflex of his red smile on its courtier face—at his back. He has come back
                    to see himself in the laughing blue eyes of her seas and streams, and to rest at noontide, like a
                    sleepy giant, on her warm green lap.</p>
                <p>The daily miracle—the miracle that none can contest, to which all are witness, has been worked—the
                    resurrection of the world. And this resurrection is not partial, not limited to humanity, as that
                    final one is towards which the eyes of the Christian church have been looking steadfastly for
                    eighteen centuries and a half; but every beast and bird and flower has shaken off Death's sweet
                    semblance, his gentle counterfeit, and is feeling, in bounding vein and rushing sap, the ecstatic
                    bliss of the mystery of life. If we never slept, we should not know the joy of waking; if we never
                    woke, we should not know the joy of sleep. How, I marvel, shall we <hi rend="i">feel</hi> the
                    happiness of heaven, if we never lose, and consequently regain it?</p>
                <p>The thrushes and blackbirds are already in the midst of their glees and madrigals and part songs.
                    They sing the same songs every day, so that they are quite perfect in them; and they are all very
                    joyful ones. In their sweet flute-language there are no words expressive of sorrow or pain; they
                    know of no minor key. There were twenty roses born last night, and the flowers are all rejoicing
                    greatly. They are smiling and whispering and gossiping together; the sweet peas, like pink and
                    purple butterflies, <pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7385-031"/>

                    to hover away with the young west wind that is sighing such a little gentle story all about himself
                    into their ears. The lambs, grown so big and woolly that one might almost mistake them for their
                    mothers, are leaping and racing and plunging about in the field below the house, in the giddiness of
                    youth, unprescient of the butcher. Hated of Miss Craven's soul as much as ever were the blind and
                    lame of King David's are those too, <hi rend="i">too</hi> agile sheep. Grievously prone are they to
                    ignore the low stone wall of partition, and work havoc and devastation among the aster tops and
                    cabbage shoots of her garden.</p>

                <p>The King of Glan-yr-Afon is not counting out his money, because he has not any to count, poor young
                    fellow. He is sitting on a garden-chair, reading the <hi rend="i">Times</hi>, and thinking how much
                    better he would rule the Fatherland, how much less mean and shabby and selfish he would make her in
                    other nations' eyes, if he might but have the whip and reins for six months or so. Old Luath lies at
                    his feet, with dim eyes half closed, snapping lazily at the flies, and catching on an average about
                    one every quarter of an hour. <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> is in the stack-yard,
                    holding a levy of ravenous fowls. She has tied a large white kitchen-apron round her waist; with one
                    hand she is holding it up, with the other she is scattering light wheat among a mixed multitude.
                    Baby Cochins, in primrose velvet; hobbledehoy Cochins, <hi rend="i"><foreign xml:lang="fr">au
                            naturel</foreign></hi>, with not a stitch of clothes on their bare, indecent backs; adult
                    Cochins, muffled and smothered up to the chin in a wealth <pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7385-032"/> of
                    cinnamon feathers, and with cinnamon stockings down to their heels; Rouen ducks, and scraggy-necked
                    turkeys. She is doing her very best to administer justice to her commonwealth, to protect the weak,
                    to prevent aggression and violence; but like many another lawgiver she finds it rather up-hill work.
                    Strive as she may, the ducks get far the best of it. They have no sense of shame, and can shovel up
                    such a quantity at a time in their long yellow bills. The turkey-cock, on the other hand, gets much
                    the worst, by reason of the long red pendant to his nose, that gets in his way and hinders him. They
                    say that Nature never makes anything for ornament alone, divorced from use; but I confess to being
                    ignorant as to what function that long flabby dangler has to fulfil. The stack-yard is all on the
                    slant; it slopes down with its many stack-frames, to the old rough grey barn that is stained all
                    over-walls and roof and door—with the stormy tears of a score of winters. There is no lack of voices
                    all about the farm to-day: voice of <persName corresp="#sarah">Sarah</persName> chattering in the
                    drying ground, where she is hanging <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s cotton gowns
                    and <persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName>'s shirts on the lines; voice of Evan Evans, the
                    carter, talking friendly to his heavy team in that deplorable tongue which, we trust, will soon be
                    among the abuses of the past; voice of Seryn (Welsh for Star), from the pasture, lowing for her
                    calf, which a day ago became veal, and a day hence (Oh blessed short memory! why cannot we take
                    lessons from a cow?) she will have forgotten utterly. Presently comes another voice, clearer,
                    stronger, nearer than the others—comes sailing up through the July air.</p>

                    she says: and in her voice there is none of love's sweet quiver, nor on her cheeks is there any sign

                    the velvet rose-leaf of her cheek. They had never kissed her before, and she felt as if the manacles
                    were being fastened round her wrists, and the gyves about her ankles. She longs to cry out and say,

                    without much difficulty, but now the words seemed infinitely, impossibly hard to frame. There is
                    upon her the shyness of a young woman with an old one; the shyness of one against three. She feels,
                    too, that it seems ungracious, churlish, when they are so glad to take her in to themselves, to
                    adopt her as their own, not to be very glad too. When a person says to one, if not in words, yet
                    with looks and gestures, "Our people shall be thy people, and our God thy God," it is not easy for a
                    plastic, gracious nature to say "No, they shall not!" however little they may relish the
                    arrangement. So, in her muteness, <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> accepts the Brandon
                    God and people as hers.</p>
                <p>Wordless and demure, she sits down on a little low seat as far removed as may be from <persName
                        corresp="#rbrandon">Robert</persName>. <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> will, no
                    doubt, be an ugly old woman; she makes rather an ugly photograph; but who can deny that she is a
                    delicious bit of colour as she sits there right in the eye of the morning sun, and not at all afraid
                    of his strict scrutiny? So many women, now-a-days, are neutral-tinted, drabbish, greyish, as if the
                    colours that God painted with were not fast, but faded, like Reynolds'. <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName>'s colouring is as distinct, as decided, as clean and clear as that on a
                    flower's petal or a butterfly's wing. Nobody speaks, except the clock with the short-waisted Minerva
                    on it, and it does not say anything <pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7385-037"/> particularly original. Then
                    the old woman bends towards the young one, and says in a kind, low voice, <said who="#mrsbrandon"
                        >"You see <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Robert</persName> has told us his news, my dear."</said>
                    There is flowing in through the French window a broad river of yellow light from the great fountain
                    in the sky; it is deluging <persName corresp="#mrsbrandon">Mrs. Brandon</persName>'s bonnet and
                        <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s hair. The bonnet is black, and the hair is
                    black; but there are blacks and blacks. The May grass is green, and a beer bottle is green; but the
                    resemblance between the two is not striking. <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> has not
                    the remotest idea what answer to make; so she chooses one of the shortest words she knows of, and
                    says <said who="#ecraven">"Yes!"</said> half-assentingly, half-interrogatively.</p>
                <p><said who="#mrsbrandon">"And we could not rest till we came and told you what good news we thought
                        it,"</said> pursues the old lady, encouragingly.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> says nothing. Her eyelids feel glued down to her
                    cheeks; she is conscious, with inward rage and vexation, of looking blushing, bashful, everything
                    that a young betrothed should look.</p>
                <p><said who="#mrsbrandon">"I'm an old woman,"</said> concludes <persName corresp="#mrsbrandon">Mrs.
                        Brandon</persName>, rather moved by her own eloquence, <said who="#mrsbrandon">"and I cannot
                        expect a great many more years of life. You know what the Psalmist sweetly says, love; but I
                        trust I may be spared to see God bless both my children, and make them His happy servants for
                        this world and the next."</said></p>
                <p>As she speaks she lays one hand on <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s head. <persName
                        corresp="#rbrandon">Bob</persName> is happily too far off, or she would lay the other on his,
                    while the two little virgin clerks from the sofa cry "Amen!" in a breath. <persName
                        corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> is half-frightened. What with the serious words, with the
                    three women's solemn faces, she half feels as if she were being married on the spot; her thoughts
                    fly to <persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName> and the notary; after that "Amen!" she is not
                    quite sure that her name is not <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> Brandon She shrinks
                    away a little, but not at all rudely.</p>

                        settled—nothing at all, I assure you. I told your son so yesterday quite plainly, only I'm
                        afraid he did not understand me,"</said> she concludes, looking rather reproachfully over at
                    him.</p>

                    snubbed and disconsolate.</p>
                <p>There is another pause, then <persName corresp="#mrsbrandon">Mrs. Brandon</persName> rises and puts
                    out her hand to <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>—in farewell this time.</p>
                <p><said who="mrsbrandon">"I'm afraid I've been in too great a hurry, my dear,"</said> she says, trying
                    not to speak stiffly, and not succeeding quite so well as she deserved. <said who="#mrsbrandon">"But
                        you'll forgive me, I'm sure; you see, mothers are apt to be partial people, and I could not
                        imagine any one trying to love my boy, and not succeeding."</said></p>
                <p>But <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName> can never let well alone. She would marry Old
                    Nick himself sooner than that his mother or sister should look askance at her, or seem hurt and
                    grieved with her for expressing any want of relish for him, hoofs and tail and horns and all.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Oh no, you must not go!"</said> she cries, in her quick, eager way, putting up
                    two anxious hands in deprecation; <said who="#ecraven">"you must not be vexed with me; I did not
                        mean to be disagreable. I shall like very much to belong to you, I'm sure. I was only afraid of
                        your expecting more from me than I had to give <hi rend="i">yet</hi>,"</said> she ends, with
                    head drooped a little, and cheeks reddened like a peach's that the sun has been kissing all the
                    afternoon.</p>


                <pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7385-039"/>
                <p>The stiffness goes away: nobody can be stiff for long with <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther
                        Craven</persName>, any more than a snow-ball can remain a snow-ball under the fire's warm

                <p>Then they go, and <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Robert</persName> walks off with his old mother on
                    his arm. He would walk down Pall Mall with her in that identical poke bonnet, and the two little
                    dowdy vestals pottering behind in the most perfect unconsciousness and simplicity, even if he were
                    to know that his brother officers, to a man, were looking out at him from the "Rag" windows.</p>

                <p><said who="#jcraven">"You look rather as if you had been poking your countenance between the bars of

                <head rend="center">CHAPTER V.</head>
                <p>T<hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> world is divided into poor and rich; into those who do things for themselves,
                    and those who get other people to do them for them. The Cravens belong to the former class. On the
                    afternoon of the day mentioned in my last chapter, <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss
                        Craven</persName> is doing for herself what she had much rather that some one else should do for
                    her. She is sitting at her sewing-machine, with a pile of huckaback cut up into towel-lengths beside
                    her. As long as civilization remains at its present ridiculous pitch of elevation, people must have
                    towels, and there is a prejudice in favour of hemmed versus ravelled edges. In the kitchen garden
                    the maid-servants are all busy, picking currants and raspberries for preserving. Owen, the gardening
                    man, is helping them; they are combining business with pleasure; fruit-picking with persiflage. How
                    loudly and shrilly they laugh! and yet loud, shrill laughter expresses mirth and cause for mirth, as
                    well as low and silvery. <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>, grave and alone, catches
                    herself wondering what the joke was that caused such general merriment two minutes ago. Probably,
                    did she know it, she would not laugh at it, would see no point in it, perhaps, but she would be glad
                    to hear it. The huckaback is thick and heavy; bending down one's head over one's work sends all the
                    blood in one's body into it. Phew! How hot! How much pleasanter to be out of doors, tweaking off
                    dead rose heads, watching the great red poppie straightening out their folded creases, pulling the
                    green <pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7385-041"/> nightcaps off the escholtzia buds! A shadow darkens the
                    French window, causing <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName> to give one of those
                    starts that make one feel as if one literally jumped out of one's skin, and fill one with ungodly
                    wrath against the occasion of them.</p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"I rang several times,"</said> says <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Robert
                        Brandon</persName>, apologetically, <said>"but nobody came."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Oh! it's you, is it?"</said> she says, with a tone not exactly of rapture in
                    her voice; <said>"our servants always manage to be out of the way on the rare occasions when any one
                        calls. They are all in the garden, picking currants; one would have been plenty, but they prefer
                        working, like convicts or navvies, in gangs."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"I came to see whether you were inclined to take a walk?"</said> he says,
                    hesitatingly, for her manner is not encouraging.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Too hot!"</said> she answers, lazily, leaning her head on the back of her
                    chair, and closing her eyes, as if his presence disposed her to sleep.</p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"Not in the wood?"</said> he rejoins, eagerly. <said who="#rbrandon">"Under our

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"I am busy!"</said> she says, pettishly, annoyed at his persistence, and taking

                    </hi></foreign>—yellow beard, frayed coat-sleeves, vigorous rustic comeliness.</p>
                <p>He does not pursue the subject further, but stands leaning wistfully and uncertain against the
                    window.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"<persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName> is not at home, I'm

                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"I did not come to see <persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName>,"</said> he
                    answers, bluntly. She does not invite him to come in, but he, crossing the threshold diffidently,
                    takes a seat near, but not aggressively near, her. <said who="#rbrandon">"Don't let me interrupt
                        you!"</said> he says, deprecatingly.</p>

                <p>She takes him at his word, and continues her homely occupation. Up and down, up and down her foot
                    goes, keeping the wheel in motion; prick, prick, prick, the needle travels with its quick, regular
                    stabs. If, as I have said, the process of bending over work on a July afternoon is heating, the
                    consciousness that another person is watching every quiver of your eyelids, counting every breath
                    you draw, and every displaced hair that straggles about brow or cheek, does not conduce to make it
                    less so. The magnetic influence that sooner or later compels the eyes of the looked at to seek those
                    of the looker, obliges <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>, after awhile, to raise
                    hers—reluctant and protesting—to <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Robert</persName>'s.</p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"I wish my mother could see you!"</said> he says, with a smile of placid

                    upon his back, almost as much as pious Æneas did the old Anchises literally. Esther suspends her

                <p>So speaking she relapses into a chafed silence, and he into his vigilant dumb observation of her. At
                    the end of a quarter of an hour, as he still shows no signs of moving, finding the present position
                    of affairs no longer tolerable, <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName> jumps up, flings
                    down her heap of huckaback on the floor, and says abruptly, with a sort of forced resignation:</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"I will come to the wood, if you wish; it will be all the same a hundred years
                        hence."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"I am perfectly happy as I am,"</said> he answers with provoking good humour,
                    looking up in blissful unconsciousness at her charming cross face, and the plain yet dainty fit of
                    her trim cheap gown.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"But I am not,"</said> she rejoins brusquely; <said who="#ecraven">"indoors it
                        is stifling to-day; please introduce me as quickly as possible to that breeze you spoke of; I
                        have not been able to find a trace of one all day."</said></p>
                <p>She fetches her hat and puts it on; too indifferent as to her appearance in his eyes to take the
                    trouble of casting even a passing glance at herself in the glass, to see whether it is put on
                    straight or crooked.</p>
                <p>The Glan-yr-Afon wood is a fickle, changeable place; like <pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7385-044"/> a vain
                    woman, it is always taking off one garment and putting on another. Three months ago, when the April
                    woods were piping to it, it had on a mist-blue cloak of hyacinths—what could be prettier?—but now it
                    has laid it aside, and is all tricked out in gay grass, green, flecked here and there with rosy
                    families of catch-fly and groups of pur- ple orchis spires. Do you remember those words of the
                    sweetest, wildest, fancifullest of all our singers?</p>

                <p>They describe Glan-yr-Afon wood much better than I can. It is a great green cathedral, where choral
                    service goes on all day long, and where the rook preaches impressive sermons from the swinging
                    tree-tops.</p>

                <p>She is mollified, despite herself, by the simple joy beaming in his poor, good-looking face—face that

                    one nearer the edge of the wood, in full view of the Naullan road, along which market women, coal
                    carts, stray limping tramps, go passing, and where loverly blandishments are out of the
                    question.</p>
                <p>The sun slides down between two birch stems that stand amid rock fragments, and riots at his will
                    about her head, as she sits at the birch foot on a great grey stone, all flourished over with green
                    mosses and little clinging plants. Below, the baby river runs tinkling; it is such a baby river that
                    it has not strength to grapple with the boulders that lie in its bed; it comes stealing round their
                    hoary sides with a coaxing noise, in gentlest swirls and bubbled eddies. The squirrels brought their
                    nuts last autumn to <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s stone to crack; the shells are
                    lying there still; she is picking <pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7385-046"/> them up and dropping them again
                    in idle play. Little dancing lights are flashing down through the birch's feathery-green locks, and
                    playing Hide and Seek over <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s gown and <persName
                        corresp="#rbrandon">Robert</persName>'s recumbent figure, as he lies in the repose of warmth,
                    absolute idleness, absolute content at her feet. An hour and a half, two hours to be spent in trying
                    to like <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Robert</persName>! Faugh! She yawns.</p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"That is the seventh time you have yawned since we have been here,"</said>

                    who are inextricably entangled in his mind with the idea of "too good for this world." He evades the

                    (beard that will have to disappear before he rejoins his gallant corps in Bermuda), and looking very
                    sentimental; <pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7385-052"/> yet not that either, for sentimental implies the

                    smile, and he is encouraged by it to refer to a subject nearer his heart than <persName

                <p>Her countenance falls, more visibly than she is herself perhaps aware of.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Of course,"</said> she answers, in a constrained voice, <said who="#ecraven"

                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"I would not come often,"</said> says the poor young man wistfully; <said

                    sort of ironical playfulness, flapping about with her pocket-handkerchief at a squadron of young
                    midges, and looking mild exasperation at the unlucky six-foot slave at her feet. Then she stretches
                    out her hand, plucks a dandelion, or what was a dandelion a week ago, but is now a sphere of
                    delicatest, fragilest, downspikes, and blows it like a child to see what o'clock it is. <said

                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"It seems only five minutes since we came,"</said> says <persName
                        corresp="#rbrandon">Robert</persName>, with a great sigh of good-bye, looking down at the long
                    stretch of bruised grass that indicates his late resting- place.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Do you think so?"</said> exclaims <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName>, opening her eyes very wide, and the most violent negative could not have

                <p>So they pass home through the loudly vocal wood, and he parts from her under the porch. He had meant
                    to squeeze her hand at parting; perhaps still bolder forms of adieu flitted before his mind's eye,
                    but a certain expression in her face makes all such plans take to their heels. He looks as if he
                    would come in if he were asked; but he is not asked, therefore, courage failing him, he departs. She
                    stands in the shadow watching him, and thinks, <said who="#ecraven">"What bad boots! and is not one
                        shoulder rather higher than the other!"</said> It is not the least bit higher; no young fir is
                    straighter than he; but when a thing belongs, or may possibly belong, to oneself, one waxes
                    marvellous critical.</p>

                <p><said>"S<hi rend="sc">OMETHING</hi> new! something new!"</said> cried the Athenians; and across two

                    there is nothing new; there was not even in King Solomon's time—not even in all his treasure-house,
                    nor among his seven hundred wives. What an advantage those ancients who saw the world's infancy had
                    over us—over us, who have to content ourselves with the lees of the wine, which the few dropped ears
                    scattered about the great reaped <pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7385-054"/> harvest field! Who would not fain
                    have lived in the days when nothing had yet been said—when everything, consequently, remained to be
                    said? Who could be trite then, in that blest epoch when platitudes were unborn, when <hi rend="i"
                        >Tupper</hi> was an impossibility, and even the statement that two and two make four had

                    underneath it. Is it too much to say that it is impossible to find an original idea in any writer we
                    wot of? You meet, perhaps, some day in a book a thought, an image that strikes you. You say,
                        <said>"This is this thinker's own; there is the stamp of this one individual mind upon

                    scribe, one that has been dust nigh ten or twenty centuries back, and you find the same thought,
                    half fledged or quarter fledged, only in the egg, perhaps—but still it is there. There is nothing
                    new under the sun.</p>
                <p>And if this is true of other subjects, how much truer of that most outworn, threadbare old theme,
                    Love! The world has been spinning round six thousand years at the lowest, most exploded computation;
                    in any thousand years there have been thirty or forty generations, and each unit in every one of
                    those generations, if he has lived to man's estate, has surely loved after one fashion or another.
                    Whosoever has done any worthy thing, whosoever has sent out his thoughts in writing or speech or

                <p>Who is it says in the "Tempest," if neither Ferdinand nor any other beautiful young Prince had come

                    water-spirits, she would have ended by loving Caliban? I do not know about Miranda, but I am sure
                    that if <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> had been in Miranda's place she would have so
                    ended; would have carried faggots in her slender arms for the shaggy monster—have called him
                    caressing diminutives, and asked him little interested questions about his dam Sycorax.</p>
                <p>The desire to be loved is strong enough in us all; in this girl it amounted to madness: it is the key
                    to all the foolish, wicked, senseless things you will find her doing through this history's short
                    course. If she could have had her will, every man, Woman, and child, every cow and calf and dog and
                    cat that met her, would have watched her coming with joy and her going with grief. Add to which, in
                    the summer time most women like to have a lover; it is almost as necessary to them as warm clothes
                    at Christmas. In winter the fire is lover enough for any one. The frosty splendour of the stars and
                    the chill flashing of the northern lights provoke no yearning in any one human soul towards any <pb
                        n="56" xml:id="VAB7385-060"/> other; we peep at them through our icy casements, then drop the
                    curtain shivering, and leave them alone to their high cold play in the sky. But who can look at a
                    July moon alone?</p>
                <p>You will say that <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> was not alone, that she had her
                    brother to look at it with her; but who will deny that a brother who makes agricultural remarks
                    about the Queen of Night, and observes that the haze round her royal head looks well for the
                    turnips, is worse, immeasurably worse than nobody? To me it seems that there is nothing absolute,
                    positive in all this shifting, kaleidoscope world; everything is comparative. There is nothing
                    either good, bad, pretty, ugly, large, small, except as compared with something better, worse,
                    prettier, uglier, larger, smaller. Measure two men together, and you find one tall and the other
                    short; put the short one by himself or among a world of pigmies, and straightway he grows tall.
                    Lacking a standard to go by, we make egregious errors. I have known many a woman to pass through
                    life with a pigmy beside her, taking him for a giant all the while, nor undeceived to the end.
                        <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> has no man to measure her <persName
                        corresp="#rbrandon">Robert</persName> by; none at all, save the cowman, the carter, and the
                    groom. Intellectually, morally, physically, he outtops them in stature, and that is all she can as
                    yet know about him. Moonlight, propinquity, total absence of objects of comparison—these three must
                    be <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s excuses.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#rbrandon">Robert</persName> is not much like her ideal, certainly—the ideal whose
                    picture she has been painting life-size on the canvas of her mind during the vacant moments of the
                    last two transitional years; but if we all waited to be wed till our ideal came knocking at our
                    doors, the world would be shortly dispeopled of legitimate inhabitants. <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Miss Craven</persName>'s ideal is dark; at seventeen, most ideals are dark: he has long,
                    fierce, sleepy, unfathomable eyes. <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Robert</persName> is straw- <pb
                        n="57" xml:id="VAB7385-061"/> coloured: his eyes are blue; very wide awake: they say exactly
                    what his tongue does, neither more nor less, and there is absolutely no harm in them—a doubtful
                    recommendation to a woman. The ideal's nose is fine cut, delicately chiselled; his cheeks are a
                    little haggard, slightly hollowed and paled by five and thirty years or so of the reckless life of
                    one that has lived, not existed. <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Robert</persName>'s nose is broad and
                    blunt; his cheeks have the roundness and bloom of a countryman's five and twenty. The ideal breaks
                    most of the commandments with easy grace; is inclined to be sceptical and a little sarcastic over
                    the old world beliefs, and facts hoary with time and reverence. <persName corresp="#rbrandon"
                        >Robert</persName> nightly prays on bent knees to be <quote>"not led into temptation but
                        delivered from evil;"</quote> he believes firmly every thing that he ever was taught, from the
                    Peep of Day upwards, and he could no more shape his honest lips into a sneer than he could square
                    the circle. Before the fell shafts of the ideal's eyes women lie slain as thick as Greeks lay
                    beneath the arrows of Apollo in the Iliad's opening clash; the number of Robert's female victims is
                    represented by a duck's egg.</p>
                <p><quote>"<foreign xml:lang="fr">Je ne comprends pas l'amour sans effroi</foreign>,"</quote> says one
                    of the characters in the best French novel I have read this many a day. The ideal inspires fear
                    equally with love; you can imagine his being harsh, fierce, cruel, to the woman he loves. In none of
                    the most hard-hearted of created beings could <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Robert</persName>
                    provoke alarm. Children who see him for the first time come and thrust their little dimpled hands
                    into his, and laugh up with confident impudence in his face. Dogs to whom he has never been
                    introduced come and rub their shaggy heads against his knees, and curl and wriggle about his
                    friendly feet.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> can indulge no faintest hope that he will bully her.
                    The ideal rides straight as a die, and is as much a part of his horse as a centaur. <persName
                        corresp="#rbrandon">Robert</persName> is very fond of getting a <pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7385-062"
                    /> day's hunting when he can afford the two guineas requisite for the hiring of a horse, which is
                    not very often; and he likes to get his money's worth by blundering blindly over everything that
                    comes in his way, but he has about as much idea of <hi rend="i">riding</hi> as a tailor or a cow.
                    The ideal is an idol to be set up and worshipped—a Baal to be adored with tears and blood and
                    knife-gashings. <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Robert</persName> is a worshipper to be encouraged by
                    a cold look and smile flung to him every now and then, like a bone to a dog, or spurned away with
                    disapproving foot, as Cain was from his unaccepted altar. To worship is to a woman always sweeter
                    than to be worshipped. To worship one must look up; to be worshipped one must look down. . . .</p>
                <p>Come with me this August Sunday through the wood from Glan-yr-Afon to Plas Berwyn—from <persName
                        corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s home to <persName corresp="#rbrandon"
                    >Robert</persName>'s. It is but a few hundred yards of shade and shine, a small, scarce trodden
                    wood-path whose narrow, faint track the ripe grasses and the seeded ferns have well-nigh
                    obliterated, flinging themselves across it in all the <hi rend="i">abandon</hi> of their unspeakable
                    grace. The apples' round faces are reddening in the little Plas Berwyn orchard; the shorn fields
                    slope barely, slantwise along the hill-side in their yellow stubble. For weeks and weeks the corn
                    has been whitening under the sun's hard, veilless stare, and now at last it has fallen; the barley
                    has bowed its bearded head beneath the sickle's stroke, and the oats their tremulous ringlets. They
                    are all gathered in, and garnered in <persName corresp="#mrsbrandon">Mrs. Brandon</persName>'s
                    stout, well-thatched stacks; to thatch a stack is the one thing a Welshman can do.</p>
                <p>It is an hour past noon, and the Reverend Evan Evans has released the bodies of his congregation from
                    that white-washed, tumble-down old barn that he is pleased to call his church, and their minds from
                    the tension necessary to take <pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7385-063"/> in the ill-strung-together,
                    misapplied texts that he is pleased to call his sermon.</p>
                <p>Plas Berwyn is a house of about the same size as Glan-yr-Afon, but the rooms do not look so large,
                    they are so full of large things and large people. The dining-toom is crowded up with a great
                    mahogany table, a great mahogany sideboard, great mahogany chairs—inconvenient relics, fondly clung
                    to by people who from a larger house have subsided into a smaller one—a sort of warranty of past
                    respectability like the cottager's japanned tea-tray and brass candlesticks. There is an atmosphere
                    of lumbersome age and gravity about the whole place; none of the fragrance and light and melody that
                    youth, sheer youth, even divorced from any other attractive qualities, brings with it.</p>
                <p>Of all the gods of the Greek mythology I will bring my votive crowns and my salt cakes to Bacchus.
                    Not the bloated old gentleman striding drunk over a barrel, as we figure him, but Bacchus eternally
                    young. What is there so worthy of adoration in this aging, wrinkling world as never ending
                    youth?</p>
                <p>Most people are cross and most people are unusually hungry on Sunday. I do not know why it is, but if
                    you observe your acquaintance you will find it to be true. Hungry or not, the Brandons are at
                    dinner, dining frugally and sparely on cold roast beef and cold apple tart. Nothing hot ever figures
                    on the Brandons' Sabbath table, not even potatoes; indeed, unless they boiled themselves, and hopped
                    out of the pot judiciously when they found themselves done, I do not see how they could, as on the
                    Sabbath morn every living soul at Plas Berwyn, every reluctant scullion and recalcitrant housemaid,
                    is trundled off to church, the house-door locked, and the key deposited in <persName
                        corresp="#mrsbrandon">Mrs. Brandon</persName>'s pocket.</p>
                <p>All the Brandons hate dining in the middle of the day, <pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7385-064"/> consequently
                    they always dine in the middle of the day on Sunday. Everybody knows that there are few things more
                    distinctly unpleasant than to sit in the same room in which you have your meals; to live with the
                    unending smell and steam of departed viands up your nose and eyes and ears: consequently the
                    Brandons always sit in the dining-room on Sunday. Sunday is to them a sort of aggravated Ash
                    Wednesday and Good Friday rolled into one. On Saturday night <persName corresp="#ebrandon">Miss
                        Bessy Brandon</persName> swoops down upon all novels, travels, biographies, magazines, poetry
                    books, that may be lying about, makes a clean sweep of them and consigns them to disgrace and a
                    cupboard till the return of Monday releases them.</p>
                <p>The Brandon family at the present moment have got their Sunday faces and their Sunday clothes on, and
                    they misbecome most of them very sorely. Very few men look their best in their Go-to-Meeting
                    clothes. For some unexplained reason, a black coat made by a country tailor shows its shortcomings
                    more plainly than a coloured one. The garment that cases <persName corresp="#rbrandon"
                        >Bob</persName>'s broad shoulders would draw tears from Mr. Poole's eyes, could he see it. As
                    for <persName corresp="#mrsbrandon">Mrs. Brandon</persName>, she always has more or less of a Sunday
                    face on— which I do not say in any dispraise, but merely to express a sober, steadfast face,
                    unfurrowed by any violent gust of mirth or blast of anger. She is like Enid and her mother,
                            <quote><l rend="center">"clad all in faded silk,"</l></quote> and on her breast she has a
                    miniature of the departed Brandon, in Geneva gown and bands, about as big as a teacup, and with two
                    small glutinous curls of the departed's hair at the back. It is so long ago since he died, that she
                    must have forgotten all about him—what he was like, even; but site still wears his effigy, as an old
                    inn continues to hang <pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7385-065"/> out the sign of the Saracen's Head, though
                    it is centuries since ever a Saracen has been seen on the earth's face.</p>
                <p>Opposite each other, like little bad mirrors of one another, sit the <persName
                        corresp="#ebrandon #jbrandon">Misses Brandon</persName>, in melancholy little gowns of no
                    particular stuff and no particular colour, and little wisps of thin, fine hair well down over their

                    figures, long plaintive noses, and meek, dull eyes proclaiming them of that virgin band to whom St.
                    Paul has awarded the palm of excellence. The Sunday literature is scattered about on the
                    hard-bottomed chairs. "Stop the Leak" lies on the pit of its stomach, open at the spot where
                        <persName corresp="#ebrandon">Miss Bessy</persName> abandoned it in favour of the cold beef; the

                <p>Nine o'clock! The maid-servants are at evening church, combining the double advantage of <hi rend="i"

                        >Esther</persName>, happily rid of hers, is sitting on the ground at the French window of the

                    to the mile-off rookery. It is such a great, still world; who would fancy that there were so many
                    noisy men, barking dogs, snorting steam-engines in it? It seems a world of stars and flowers, as one

                <p> T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> 2.25 train from Brainton is due at Felton at 5.30. It is drawing near Mither
                    now, escorted by a vanguard, bodyguard, and rearguard of dust-clouds; it rushes along, with the sun
                    beating down on the roofs of the carriages, making them like little compartments of Hades. If the
                    devil took a hint from the Coldbath Fields cells for "improving the prisons of Hell," he certainly
                    might take a hint from the Brainton train for improving the travelling conveyances of the same
                    locality.</p>
                <p>In one of the first-class carriages there is a baby: it has got a cold, and seems rather inclined to
                    be sick; so both the nurse, on whose lap it lies gaping and blowing bubbles, and the idolising
                    mother, who sits over against it, insist on keeping its window tight up. There is a rusty old
                    divine, in gilt-rimmed spectacles and a jowl, reading the <hi rend="i">Guardian</hi>; a commercial
                    traveller, with his hat off, his legs up, and a gaudy cap on his head, fast asleep; and, lastly, a
                    little young lady, sitting facing the engine, with the dusty blast driving hot and full in her face,
                    blinking, coughing, choking, with the utmost patience. On her lap lies a huge bunch of red and
                    yellow roses and heavy-scented double-stocks, all limp and drooping and soiled. <persName
                        corresp="#rbrandon">Bob</persName> gave them to her when he came down to the station to see her
                    off-and very kind of him too, and very nice they are; but all the same, as she has already a bag, a
                    box, and a parasol to carry, she thinks (though she barely owns it to herself) that she would almost
                    as soon have been without them.</p>
                <p>The dusty blast blows gentler, moderates to a dusty zephyr; the train is slackening speed.

                    standing on its head, and looking half inclined to burst asunder in the midst. She is ashamed of her
                    destitute condition, and ashamed of herself for being ashamed of it.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Will it change into a pumpkin?"</said> thinks <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss
                        Craven</persName>, as she steps into a large yellow barouche, with two fidgety, showy greys,
                    that is waiting for her at the station gate. After the yammering of the baby, the dull rumble-rumble
                    of the train, how delicious! <said who="#ecraven">"If it were only my own,"</said> she says to
                    herself, throwing herself back with a consequential feeling on the soft cushions, as some country
                    people pass and pull their forelocks to the well-known liveries.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Well, odder things have happened! <hi rend="i">But</hi> for <persName

                <p>As they pass <persName corresp="#lgerard">Lady Gerard</persName>'s model school, twenty little
                    charity girls come trooping out in the uniformity of their cotton frock and straw bonnet livery, and
                    drop twenty bob courtesies to <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>, who feels as the man
                    in the "Arabian Nights" did who woke and found himself Sultan. Labouring men go stumping heavily
                    home, with their tools over their shoulders and their heads bent earthwards, as is always <pb n="75"
                        xml:id="VAB7385-079"/> the case with the tillers of the soil, who must—oh, hard necessity!—be
                    ever looking down.</p>
                <p>Park palings, through which the strong brake fern is thrusting itself, slide past; then a red lodge,
                    picked out with blue bricks, where an obsequious old woman rushes out from the washtub, with hands
                    all soapsuds, to open the gates; then a grassy, knolly park; then a great red house, likewise picked
                    out with blue bricks; then stones clattering under an echoing portico; then the pumpkin stops, and
                    Cinderella descends.</p>
                <p><said who="#butler">"<persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName>!"</said> announces the
                        <persName corresp="#butler">butler</persName>, opening a tall door; and <persName
                        corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName>, plucking up heart, marches into a high, dark library,
                    lined with high, dark books—marches in, looking very much like a chimney sweep. Dust lies in ridges
                    on her once white bonnet; dust, instead of belladonna, in streaks under her eyes; dust on the
                    parting of her hair, on her eyelashes, up her nose (on which there is also, though, happily for her,
                    she does not know it, a large smut), and a double portion of dust on the great, faded, yellow roses,
                    to which she cleaves with as much pertinacity as the idiot in "Excelsior" clave to that senseless
                    banner which he was so determined to run up hill with.</p>
                <p>As she enters, a goddess rises like an exhalation (as Pandemonium did), and comes floating on lilac
                    clouds towards her. This is as things seem to her; in reality, a large, fair, young woman comes
                    forward in a long-tailed mauve muslin. Simultaneously a man's two legs are seen disappearing over
                    the window-sill.</p>

                <p><said who="#cblessington">"How do you do?"</said> says the goddess, sweetly. <said
                        who="#cblessington">"I think the train must have been rather late; we expected you half an hour
                        ago."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Yes."</said></p>
                <p>A little pause, each taking stock.</p>

                <p>The tea is poured out; it has been standing on the table an hour, and is perfectly cold. The goddess
                    and the little female collier examine each other stealthily.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Rather alarming,"</said> thinks the latter: <said who="#ecraven">"talks in such

                    because he knows, if he trusted himself to speak at all, it would be to contradict his father flat

                    a large copper-coloured woman by Rubens, in no dress at all; "Susanna and the Elders;" "Jupiter and
                    Leda" (twice life-size); a "Venus Sleeping, surprised by Satyrs" (a great gem); and many other like
                    subjects, such as one mostly meets with in the dining-rooms of English nobles and gentles—subjects
                    pleasant and profitable, to employ the eyes and minds of their daughters while engaged in eating
                    their dinners. <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> is staring hard at Susanna's fat, coy
                    face, when her attention is recalled by <persName corresp="#sjgerard">Mr. Gerard</persName>'s voice
                    addressing her. She starts and blushes furiously, like a child whose fingers have been found
                    straying among the jam-pots. He looks amused at her confusion.</p>

                <p>The birds have gone to bed, and the slugs come out to walk on the damp garden paths. Now and then a
                    little wind gets up, whispers a word or two to the polished laurel leaves, and lies down again.
                    There is a carpet of thin, smoke-grey clouds over heaven's blue floor. The two girls are strolling
                    up and down the terrace walk. <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> has got a red cloak

                    the terrace, and that the fairy prince may see and like the combination of black eyes and red cloth
                    (fairy princes being always partial to gay colours), accepted it.</p>

                    height. The difference between them is, that one is a young, slight sapling that has, been so busy
                    shooting up skywards, that it has <pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7385-086"/> had no leisure to grow broad,

                    but some women develope, mind and body, much quicker than others.</p>
                <p>From the unshuttered dining-room windows comes a great square of yellow lamplight, and lies smooth
                    upon the gravel. Looking in you see rifled fruit dishes, half-filled wine-glasses, moths flying
                    round and round the lamp globes, trying their best to find an entrance to fiery death.</p>

                    apparently has an aversion from going out and coming in by the authorised modes of exit and

                    eager eyes—eyes that seem to be looking, looking for something that they have not found yet—and
                    rather a long nose, that the sun has got hold of and browned, as a cook browns mashed potatoes.</p>

                    the table; she is sitting there now. Her shapely hands are busy among the teacups; her white lids

                    even undulations. Eve, as she was when first she grew into separate entity and embodiment out of
                    Adam's side; Eve, of creamiest flesh, and richest, reddest blood, before a soul—a tormenting,

                    eyes, the better to appreciate the exquisite turn of the cold, stately throat, the modelling of the
                    little rounded wrist; would put his head on one side, and look at it this way and that, to determine
                    whether he liked the tinting. <quote><l rend="center">"Faultily faultless, icily regular, splendidly

                <p>Every one's letters at Felton are put on their plate for them. As <persName corresp="#ecraven"

                    scrawling, schoolboy hand. The blood rushes to her face, as it does to a turkeycock's wattles when
                    he is excited or angry, and she thrusts it hastily into her pocket. To her guilty imagination it
                    seems that written all over it, in big red letters, legible to every eye, is, "From <persName
                        corresp="#rbrandon">Bob Brandon</persName>, <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther
                        Craven</persName>'s lover." As her eyes lift themselves shyly, to see whether <persName

                    and the turkeycock hue spreading to the edge of her white gown.</p>
                <p>The morning hours at Felton are not exciting. <persName corresp="#tgerard">Sir Thomas</persName> is
                    building a new orchid house, and spends much of his time standing over the bricklayers, like an

                    ingenuity, as, from the greater rapidity of his thoughts than of his pen, he omits most of the
                    little words—<hi rend="i">tos</hi> and <hi rend="i">ands</hi> and <hi rend="i">whichs</hi>

                    great many questions as to what <persName corresp="#sjgerard">Mr. Gerard</persName> was like, with
                    solemn adjurations to answer them; a sheet devoted to the exposition of the luxury in which it is
                    possible to live on £300 a year; and, lastly, a sentence or two as to his great loneliness, and his
                    eager longing to have his darling <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> back again—not much
                    on that head, as if he were afraid of marring her enjoyment by intruding upon her the picture of his
                    own disconsolateness. It was not an eloquent letter; in fact, it was rather a stupid one, and had
                    evidently been written with a very nasty scratchy pen; but for all that it was a nice one, and so
                        <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> felt, and wished that it had been less so.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#rbrandon">Bob</persName> is a dear fellow; and, no doubt, when she goes back to
                    Glan-yr-Afon, she will be very glad to see him, and be very fond of him; but, for the present, she
                    would like to forget him altogether—to have a holiday from him: he seems to come in incongruously

                        <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName>'s knowledge of horsemanship is confined to
                    her exploits on a small, shaggy, down-hearted Welsh pony, concerning whom it would be difficult to
                    predicate which he was fullest of, years or grass. <persName corresp="#cblessington">Miss

                    for her, but a well-made garment always manages to adapt itself more or less to any figure, and she
                    does not look amiss in it. It is a matter of very little consequence to her at the present moment
                    how she looks; she is the arrantest coward in Christendom, and her heart sinks down to the bottom of
                    her boots as she sees three horses that look unnaturally tall and depressingly cheerful issue
                    through the great folding-doors that open into the stable-yard.</p>

                <p>After two abortive attempts, in the first of which she springs short, and glides ignobly to earth

                    best of it, sitting in a garden-chair under a tulip tree, eating apricots. The deer, with dappled
                    sides and heavy- horned heads, are herding about the rough, knotted feet of the great trees that
                    stand here and there in solitary kingship about the park. They spread their ancient, out-stretched
                    arms between earth and heaven, and man and beast rejoice in the shade thereof. The dust lies a
                    hand-breadth thick upon the road; the nuts in the hedgerow, the half-ripe blackberries, the rag-wort
                    in the grass—all merge their distinctive colours in one dirty-white mask.</p>

                <p>The animal that inspires such alarm in <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s mind, is a

                    the quietness of <pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7385-098"/> a young, oats-fed mare, and of an antediluvian
                    Welsh pony blown out with grass, are two different things. She is sidling along now, half across the

                <p><said who="#tgerard">"Pooh!"</said> answers <persName corresp="#tgerard">Sir Thomas</persName>, in

                <p>The glare from the road, the dust and the midges, make people keep their eyes closed as nearly as

                    dawdling along to meet them on a stout, grey cob, with his hat and coat and whiskers nearly as white
                    as any miller's, is <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName>. He looks rather annoyed at

                <p>She was rather compunctious the moment she had said it. It is reversing the order of things—the woman

                <p>The road is broad, and for a little while they all four jog on abreast, as in a Roman chariot-race or

                    so the horses think as they break into a brisk canter. The quick air freshens the riders'
                    faces—comes to them like comfortable words from Heaven to a soul in Purgatory—as they dash along
                    under the trees, stooping their heads every now and then to avoid coming into contact with the

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"I shall have to turn into a man, then,"</said> she says, glancing rather

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"No, you won't,"</said> (laughing).</p>
                <p>He rises, and unfastens the cob from the tree-branch to which he has been tied. He has been indulging
                    a naturally greedy disposition—biting off leaves and eating them—until he has made his bit and his
                    mouth as green as green peas.</p>

                <p>He stoops and lifts her gently. He is not a Samson or a prize-fighter, and well grown young women of
                    seventeen are not generally feather-weights; but yet it seems to him that the second occupied in
                    raising her from the ground and placing her in the saddle was shorter than other seconds.</p>
                <p>A man's arms are not sticks or bits of iron, that they can hold a beautiful woman without feeling it.

                    pleasure. His arms seem to feel the pressure of that pleasant burden long after they have been

                <p>She feels an overpowering shrinking from the enforced, unavoidable familiarity. It does not arise
                    from any distaste for <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName> certainly, nor yet from any
                    quixotic loyalty to <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Bob</persName>; it springs from a new, unknown,
                    uncomprehended shyness.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Very well,"</said> he answers, quietly, releasing her instantly, and taking

                    then recovers herself with an awkward jerk. The sun is hot. Now and then, as the cob puts his foot
                    on a mole-hill, or some other slight inequality in the ground, her ankle bumps against the
                    saddle-flap. She feels turning giddy and sick with the heat and the pain.</p>

                        corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> spends the day in her bedroom, lying in state on a sofa
                    with her ankle bandaged up. It hurts her acutely if she attempts to walk on it; but if she keeps
                    quiet, she is hardly aware of there being anything wrong with it. It is very annoying having to play
                    the invalid for an ailment that is purely local when you feel in riotous health and spirits—to have
                    your dinner sent up to you on a tray when you are so hungry that you could eat double your allotted
                    portion, if it were not that, being an invalid, you are ashamed to say so. One has a sense of
                    shamming, malingering.</p>
                <p>Poor <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName> passes a very dull day; the red rose on one
                    side the window, and the travellers' joy on the other, look in and say, <said>"Why is this lazy
                        child lying all day on a couch, when we and so many other flowers have been calling to her with
                        our voiceless voices to come out into the breeze and shine"</said> A bee comes in sometimes, and
                    goes buzz-buzzing about, telling himself how busy he is, and that he has no time to waste now that
                    his honey-harvest is drawing so near <pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7385-109"/> to its sweet close. The room
                    is so still that, but for feeling intensely alive, and not having her chin tied up, <persName
                        corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> might almost imagine herself laid out previous to her
                    interment. Now and again <persName corresp="#cblessington">Miss Blessington</persName> enters
                    noiselessly, says <said who="#cblessington">"I hope you are feeling a little easier,"</said> in her
                    soft monotone, and then rustles gently away again. She has provided <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName> with a novel and a book of acrostics, and thinks she has done her duty by her
                    neighbour amply. The novel is one written with a purpose; a dull one-sided tilt against Ritualism.
                        <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> never found out an acrostic in her life, and has
                    seldom been so completely vacant of employment as to try. She is, therefore, reduced to spending
                    half the day in writing to <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Bob</persName>—half the day! and yet when
                    the letter is finished it only covers three sides of a sheet. She has written, rewritten, and
                    re-rewritten it. All around and about her lie half-covered, quarter-covered, whole-covered sheets,
                    all stamped with the seal of condemnation. <persName corresp="#sjgerard">Gerard</persName> is the
                    stumbling block; his name either will not come in at all, which looks unnatural, or else insists on
                    thrusting itself in every second line. This is the form in which <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss

                                and his ward (so I did; I set out with them), and I stupidly fell from my horse, a sort

                    slippers, that look as if they had been just kicked off—his eye takes in all the details. He feels
                    like Faust in Marguerite's chamber. And Marguerite herself, lying careless, restful on her couch,
                    her two arms flung lazily upwards and backwards, to make a resting-place for her head; the smooth
                    elbows and shoulders gleaming warm, cream-white, through the colder blue-white of her dress; and the
                    up-looking face, childish in its roundness, and blooming down—but oh! most womanish—in the shafts of
                    quick fire that greet him from the laughing, sleepy eyes: Where did she learn that art of shooting?

                    the sky and the trees that lie far down in the blue mirror. Down the grand staircase he bears her,

                <p>The morning-room at Felton (so called because the family always sit there in the evenings) is very

                    Iona, pendant from the ceiling. There are statuettes in plenty standing about in niches and on
                    pedestals. Venuses and Minervas and Clyties, all with their hair very elaborately dressed, and not a

                <p><persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName> has been rather unlucky in his experiences of women
                    hitherto. He has got rather into the habit of thinking that all good women must be stupid, and that
                    all pleasant women must be bad. <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> is not stupid. Is she
                    bad, then? Those glances of hers, they give a man odd sensations about the midriff; they inspire in
                    him a greedy, covetous desire for more of them; but are they such as Una would have given her Red
                    Cross Knight? Are they such as a man would like to see his wife bestow on his men friends? The
                    wilder a man is or has been himself, the more scrupulously fastidious he is about the almost prudish
                    nicety of the women that belong to him. He likes to see the sheep and the goats as plainly, widely
                    separated as they are in the parable; it moves him to deep wrath when he sees a good woman faintly,
                    poorly imitating a bad one. I do not think that good women believe this half generally enough; or,
                    if they do, they do not act upon it.</p>

                    where mignonette ends up continual presents of the strongest and sweetest of all flower-perfumes to

                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> has, as you know, made but light of her accident in

                    threadbare shooting jacket, through whose sleeves he always appears to have thrust his long arms too
                    far, and his patched, creaking, Naullan boots. Imagine <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St.

                        <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName> is no dandy, it is true, but coats from
                    Poole's are as much a matter of course to him as a knife and fork to eat his dinner with, or a bed

                <p>A man in the loose carelessness of his every-day country clothes is a man: in the prim tightness of

                    wheel; <said who="#ecraven">"in such cases it is always best to take the initiative. It would have

                <p>Precisely seventeen minutes past two of the clock, the Melford town-hall clock, and visitors are
                    beginning to arrive pretty thickly; three or four barouches, seven or eight waggonettes, and nine or
                    ten pony-carriages, are trotting and walking and crawling up the steep Melford street. Climbing the
                    side of a house is child's play to the ascent of that most perpendicular of high streets. The
                    doctor's house, red, and with redder berries thick about its plate-glass windows, stands on your
                    right as you go up the town. The Doctor and the Doctress are issuing from the brass-knockered hall
                    door—she in a grey moire antique, that old Mrs. Evans' quinsy paid for, and gold bracelets that took
                    their rise from Mr. Watkin's decline and fall.</p>
                <p>The town-hall stands in its grey limestone respectability in the market place, over against the Bell
                    Inn; it has an arched doorway, and under this arch man, woman, and child go pacing in little, smart
                    tulle bonnets and black hats, with their purses full of small change, and their hearts of that most
                    excellent virtue—Christian charity. Round the hall counters are ranged, and behind these counters
                    stand a phalanx of young women, prepared to exert their little abilities in overreaching and
                    circumventing their fathers, lovers, and brothers, to the utmost.</p>

                    result being much animal heat, some ill-humour, and infinite grief over rent garments; which is
                    reversing the case of the ancients, who rent their garments in sign of grief. And in and through and
                    about this warm throng, many girls, emissaries from different stalls, go pushing and elbowing to
                    enlist unwilling subscribers to raffles. Philanthropy has gone nigh to unsexing them; it has turned

                <p>He looks at the title, and a slightly shocked expression dawns on his features: men are always

                <p>When he is gone, finding that the rest of the company have likewise slipped away in different

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"I don't want to come in,"</said> she answers, standing in beautiful, bashful

                <p>At the end of her sentence her eyes, downcast at first, raise themselves to his with the innocent,

                    says, kneeling on one knee, and looking up gravely for advice and assistance into his friendly, dark

                <p>She obeys, and her eyes wander curiously round. Pipes, whips, saloon pistols, prints of Derby
                    winners; photographs of Nilsson tricked out in water-weeds as "Ophelia;" of Patti gazing up, as
                    "Marguerite," into Mario's fortunate eyes; a table strewn with books—two or three yellow-paper
                    backed, with enticing Gallic titles, similar to the one she has just so heroically foregone. Looking
                    up from these latter, she involuntarily catches his eye.</p>

                <p>Was not it Lord Chesterfield who said that the guests at a dinner party should never be less than the
                    Graces or more than the Muses? Kant preferred the Grace number, and had daily two friends, never
                    more, to dine with him. The guests at the Felton banquet greatly exceed the Chesterfieldian limits.
                    Those who have come only to dinner have been bemoaning themselves heavily, as they came along, on
                    the hardship of being forced away from garden and croquet-ground, and obliged to drive three, four,
                    five miles bare-necked and bare-backed—and a woman nowadays in full dress is verily and indeed

                    his companion's prattle, so as that prattle does not infringe upon the succulent programme that he
                    has, by diligent study of the <hi rend="i"><foreign xml:lang="fr">menu</foreign></hi>, laid out for
                    himself.</p>
                <p>Baffled on her left hand, <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName> turns to her right, to
                    be baffled there also. Not that this right-hand neighbour labours under any excessive <hi rend="i"
                            ><foreign xml:lang="fr">gourmandise</foreign></hi>—he is willing, on the contrary, that the
                    unknown, black-eyed innocent and the turtle cutlet should share and share alike in his regards; but
                    ere a quarter of an hour their conversation has come to a shipwreck. In it he takes too much for
                    granted: as, for example, that she has been to London this season ; that she has seen Faed's last
                    picture; that she has been at Lady—'s ball; that, by having seen both, she is in a position to judge
                    of the comparative merits of Mademoiselle Nilsson's and Madame Carvalho's rendering of "Marguerite."
                    Tired at length of saying, <said who="#ecraven"> "I was not there,"</said>
                    <said who="#ecraven">"I have not seen it,"</said>
                    <said who="#ecraven">"I never heard of her,"</said> she relapses into a mortified silence; thinking,
                    what an impostor must I be to have thrust myself in among all these fine people—I, who cannot even
                    catch their jargon for five minutes!</p>
                <p>Foiled in her own little conversational ventures, she tries to listen to other people's. In vain: if,
                    above the general hum, she catches the beginning of one sentence, it is immediately joined on to the
                    end of another. As well, listening to the sultry buzz of a swarm of bees, might one try to
                    distinguish each separate voice. But the dumb show, at least, is left her: the waggling heads, the
                    moving jaws—poor jaws, that have to talk and eat both at once! To put a history to each of these
                    heads—to pick out characters by watching the delicate shades of difference with which each person
                    sits; says, <said who="#ecraven">"No, thank you;"</said> laughs—this is not unamusing. Yes, to study
                    the faces, and find similitudes for them: one nut-cracker; several flowers; one plum-pudding; one
                    horse, one vulture, one door-knocker. She is <pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7385-147"/> puzzled to find a
                    resemblance for all; for <persName corresp="#bdenzil">Belinda Denzil</persName>, for instance, who,
                    virginally clad in white muslin, that seems to mock her thirty celibate years, is apparently forcing
                    the suave yet weary <persName corresp="#ddgrey">De Grey</persName> into an up-hill, one-sided
                    flirtation. No man has hired <persName corresp="#bdenzil">Belinda</persName>, and it is, with her,
                    the eleventh hour. What fowl, or fish, or quadruped, or article of furniture is she most like?
                    Before <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> can decide this point quite to her mind, the
                    signal of retirement is given, and each maid and wife rises obedient and vanishes.</p>

                <p>It is the general complaint in the Felton neighbourhood that at that house the men sit unfashionably,
                    wearisomely long over their wine. <persName corresp="#tgerard">Sir Thomas</persName> belongs to that
                    excellent school that in their hearts regret the good old days, when a man never rejoined the ladies
                    without seeing double their real number. Half an hour, three-quarters of an hour, an hour and a
                    quarter have passed. Several girls are beginning to yawn behind their fans; the <persName
                        corresp="#adegrey #gdegrey">Misses De Grey</persName> are driving heavily through a long duet,
                    with never a squire to turn over the leaves (in the wrong place) for them. The door opens, and a
                    fat, bald head appears; the most uninteresting always come first, but, like Noah's dove, he is the
                    harbinger of better things. Five minutes more, and the room is as full of broadcloth as of silk and
                    satin. The younger men are still hovering about uncertainly, unfixed as yet in their minds as to
                    which elaborate fair one they shall come to final anchor by.</p>
                <p>The epicure, now that there is nothing to eat, casts his eyes round in search of the finest woman and
                    the comfortablest chair to be found in the great gilded room. Both requisites he finds united in
                    Esther's neighbourhood. Accordingly he is moving towards her, when his attention is happily arrested
                    by a remark that he overhears as to the best method of dressing <hi rend="i"><foreign xml:lang="it"
                            >beccaficos</foreign></hi>. Instantly <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName>'s
                        <pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7385-148"/> white, silky shoulders and red-pouted lips go out of his
                    head. White shoulders and red lips are good things in their way, but what are they to <hi rend="i"
                            ><foreign xml:lang="it">beccaficos</foreign>!</hi>
                    <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> draws a long breath of relief. What an escape! In a
                    minute more suspense is ended, and the low armchair beside her is occupied by the person for whom it
                    was intended—for whom, indeed, she has been slyly keeping it half-covered by her dress.</p>

                <p><persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName> is not in the very least degree elevated; but it is

                    he really thinks so. <said who="#sjgerard">"Don't look so disgusted,"</said> he continues, laughing.
                        <said who="#sjgerard">"I was afraid you were bored at dinner: you looked absent; I tried to

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"I was not bored,"</said> she answers, simply; <said who="#ecraven">"I was quite
                        happy. You see I did not know who was who, and I <pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7385-149"/> amused

                        old woman; I wish it was not ill-manners to point. They both looked so red and pursy and
                        consequential, as if they had been telling each other for the last thirty years what swells they

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"<hi rend="i">Which</hi> old man to <hi rend="i">which</hi> old woman? Oh! I

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"They are rather like one another, too,"</said> she continues, gravely; <said
                        who="#ecraven">" and you know people say that, however unlike they may be at starting, merely by

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Do they?"</said> he says, a transient thought flashing through his mind as to
                    whether, after twenty years of wedlock, that blooming peach face would have gained any likeness to
                    his hard, mahogany one. <said who="#sjgerard">"But how did you find out your mistake?"</said></p>

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Does it?"</said> he says, involuntarily drawing his chair closer to hers, and
                    leaning forward under pretence of looking at the flowers that make a scarlet fire in her hair. <said

                <p>She forgets to reply to his harmless question, while her <pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7385-150"/> eyes fall
                    troubled, half-frightened: the eyes that cannot, without a theft upon a third person, give him back
                    his tender looks—the eyes in whose pupils <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Brandon</persName> is to see
                    himself reflected for the next forty, fifty, sixty years.</p>
                <p>There is a little stir and flutter among the company: <persName corresp="#bdenzil">Belinda

                    a polite hush, infringed only by a country gentleman in the distance saying something rather loud
                    about guano, while <persName corresp="#bdenzil">Belinda</persName> informs her assembled friends in
                    a faint soprano that <said who="#bdenzil">"He will return; she knows he will."</said> She has made
                    the same asseveration any time the last ten years; but he has not returned yet, and her relatives
                    begin to be afraid that he never will.</p>
                <p>During the song <persName corresp="#sjgerard">Gerard</persName> falls into a reverie. At the end,
                    coming out of it, he asks with an abrupt change of subject: <said who="#sjgerard">"What did you say

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"What does it mean? or does it mean anything?"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"It means 'Bank of the River;' so called, because it is not near the bank of any

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"If you are three miles from Naullan, and they are only four, I don't see how

                <p>She does not answer for a moment, but only furls and unfurls her fan uneasily; then, looking up with
                    a sudden, honest impulse, speaks, colouring up to the eyes the while. <said who="#ecraven">"Why

                        and he was afraid she might feel neglected."</said></p>

                <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> world's life is shorter by a fortnight than it was on that last day I told you
                    of, and during that fortnight the ordinary amount of things have happened. The usual <pb n="149"
                        xml:id="VAB7385-153"/> number of people have had their bodies knocked to atoms and their souls
                    into eternity by express trains; the usual number of men and maids have come together in the <hi
                        rend="i">Times</hi> column in holy matrimony; and the usual number of unwelcome babies have been
                    consigned to the canals. A great many players have laid down their cards, risen up, and gone away
                    from the game of life; but whether winners or losers, they tell us not, neither shall we know
                    awhile; and other players have taken their places, and have sat down with the zest of ignorance.

                        going."</l></quote> She is briskly occupied at her old business—the business that seems to us so
                    purposeless, progressless, bootless—the making only to unmake; the beautifying only to make hideous;
                    the magnifying only to debase. Oh life! life! Oh clueless labyrinth! Oh answerless riddle!</p>
                <p>September is waning mellowly into death, like a holy man to whom an easy passage has been vouchsafed;
                    the land has been noisy with guns, and many partridges have been turned into small bundles of
                    ruffled features—little round, brown corpses. <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Bob Brandon</persName>
                    walks stoutly up the furzy hill sides and along the stony levels after the shy, scarce birds; he is
                    out and about all day, but you do not hear him whistling or humming so often as you used to do.
                        <quote>"He goeth heavily, as one that mourneth."</quote> The fortnight is past, and yet another
                    week, and still <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> holds no speech of returning; her
                    letters have waxed fewer, shorter, colder. Since that first one, mention of <persName
                        corresp="#sjgerard">Gerard</persName>'s name is there in them none. <persName
                        corresp="#rbrandon">Bob</persName> is not of a suspicious nature, but he can add two and two
                    together. He has been doing that little dreary sum all the last ten days, till his head aches. But
                    though he can do this sum himself, he will pot suffer any one else to do it—at least in his
                    presence.</p>

                <p>One day at dinner, when <persName corresp="#ebrandon">Bessy</persName> was beginning a little sour
                    adaptation of the text, <quote>"The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye,"</quote> &amp;c., to
                        <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>, he interrupted her with downright outspoken
                    anger and rebuke; and, though he apologised to her afterwards, and begged her pardon for having
                    spoken rudely to her, yet she felt that that theme must not be dealt with again. He had promised to
                    love her always in all loyalty, and whether she were loyal or disloyal to him made no difference. He
                    will let no man, woman, or child speak evil of her in his hearing: <quote><l rend="ti-3">"..... love

                    to feel rather lonely as he sits by himself on the window-ledge of an evening, smoking his pipe,
                    with no one to take it out of his mouth now, and thinking on his unpaid for steam ploughs and
                    sterile mountain-fields, with no one to speak comfortably to him, or console him with sweet
                    illogical logic.</p>
                <p><quote>"All is not gold that glitters."</quote> Care gets up behind the man, however fine a horse he

                    admiration and liking and love she had hankered so greedily after, had striven unfairly for, had
                    made wicked lightnings from her eyes to obtain, was ready to be poured out lavishly, eagerly,
                    honestly at her feet, and she dare not put out a finger to take them up. She had been walking miles
                    and miles of nights, up and down her bedroom, from door to window, from window to door, when all the
                    rest of the house are abed and asleep.</p>

                    the candles, so tall at dressing time, burn short and low. <said who="#ecraven">"Oh! if I had some

                <p>One must go to bed at some time or other, however puzzled and pondering one may be; and in
                    furtherance of this end, <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>, having reached this turn in
                    her reflections, begins to undress. In so doing she misses a locket containing <persName
                        corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName>'s picture, which she always wears round her neck. She must
                    have dropped it downstairs, where perhaps some housemaid's clumsy foot may tread upon it, and mar
                    the dear, ugly young face within. She must go and look for it, though the clock is striking one. She
                    takes up her candle, and runs lightly downstairs. The gas is out. Great shadows from behind come up
                    alongside, and then stretch ahead of her; the statues glimmer ghostly chill from their dark
                    pedestals. With a shock of frightened surprise she sees a stream of light issuing through the
                    half-open door of the morning-room. Is it burglars, or are the flowers giving a ball, as in
                    Andersen's fair, fanciful tale? She creeps gently up, and peeps in. The lamp still burns on the
                    centre table, and pacing up and down, up and down, as she has been doing overhead, is a man buried
                    in deepest thought. Fear gives place to a great, pleasant shyness. <said who="#ecraven"> "I—I—I have

                <p>He gives a tremendous start. <said who="#sjgerard">"You up still!"</said> he says, in astonishment.
                        <said who="#sjgerard">"Lost your locket, have you? Oh! by-the-by, I found it just now; here it
                        is. Do you know (with a smile) I could not resist the temptation of looking to see who you had
                        got inside it. Are you very angry?"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Very!"</said> she answers, drooping her eyes under his. She could sit and stare
                    into <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Bob</persName>'s eyes by the hour together, if she liked, only
                    that it would be rather a dull amusement; with <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName> it
                    is different.</p>

                        as misfortunes never come singly, I staked one of the best horses I ever was outside of: that

                    beforehand with the world.</p>

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Do you ever tell untruths?" </said> he asks, hurriedly, scanning her face with
                    anxious eyes, that try to look through the mask of fair, white flesh, and see the heart underneath.

                <p>His countenance clears a little. <said who="#sjgerard"> "You must forgive me,"</said> he says,
                    repentantly. <said who="#sjgerard">"I suppose it is my own unlucky experience that has made me so

                <p>He watches her changing, flushing, paling face, with a keen solicitude which surprises himself. What

                <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> weekly clearance of mundane books has been made at Plas Berwyn; the skimp drab
                    gowns, and the ill-made frock coat, whose flaps lap over one another so painfully behind, have been
                    endured by the <persName corresp="#ebrandon #jbrandon">Misses Brandon</persName> and their brother
                    respectively. At church has been all the Brandon household: son and daughters, man-servant and
                    maid-servant, ox and sheep, camel and ass. I need hardly say that the last quartette have been
                    introduced merely for the sake of euphony, and to give a fuller rhythm to the close of the sentence.
                    The <persName corresp="#jbrandon #ebrandon">Misses Brandon</persName> always stand as stiff as
                    pokers during the creed, with their backs to the altar. It amuses them, and it does not do anybody
                    else any harm, so why should not they, poor women? <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Bob</persName>
                    truckles to the Scarlet Woman; he bows, and turns his honest, serious face to the east. The service
                    is in Welsh, of which he does not understand a word. He can pick his way pretty well through the
                    prayers, however, by the help of a Welsh and English prayer book. There are several landmarks that
                    he knows, whose friendly faces beam upon him now and again when he is beginning to flounder
                    hopelessly among uncouth words of seven consonants and a vowel. These are his chief finger-posts:

                    does, been reading the inscriptions on the coffin-plates, nailed up, Welsh fashion, against the
                    dilapidated, whitewashed walls, in lieu of monumental tablets. <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName> has also been to church; has been in state in a great, close carriage, in
                    company with <persName corresp="#tgerard">Sir Thomas</persName>, <persName corresp="#lgerard"
                        >Miladi</persName>, and <persName corresp="#cblessington">Miss Blessington</persName>. <persName
                        corresp="#tgerard">Sir Thomas</persName> has been storming the whole way about a gap he detected
                    in a hedge that they passed, through which some cattle have broken, so that they all arrive at the
                    church door in that calmly devout state of quietude which is the fittest frame of mind for the
                    reception of Divine truth.</p>
                <p>The Gerard pew in Felton church is as large as a moderate-sized room, and is furnished with
                    arm-chairs and a fireplace. In winter, <persName corresp="#tgerard">Sir Thomas</persName> spends
                    fully half the service time in poking the fire noisily and raking out the ashes. There is no fire
                    now, and he misses it. A high red curtain runs round the sacred enclosure, and through it the
                    farmers' wives and daughters strain their eyes to catch a glimpse of <persName corresp="#lgerard"
                        >Miladi</persName>'s marabout feathers, and <persName corresp="#cblessington">Miss
                        Blessington</persName>'s big, golden chignon, and little green aerophane bonnet. <persName
                        corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName> generally pulls the brass rings of his bit of curtain
                    aside along the brass rods, to make a peep-hole for himself over the congregation. The shape and
                    size of the pew do away with the necessity for any wearisome conformity of attitude among the
                    inmates. During the prayers, <persName corresp="#tgerard">Sir Thomas</persName> stands bolt upright,
                    with one bent knee resting on his chair; his bristling grey head, shaggy brows, and fierce
                    spectacles looming above the red curtain, to the admiration and terror of the row of little charity
                    girls beneath. <persName corresp="#cblessington">Constance</persName> kneels forward on a hassock,
                    with a large, ivory <pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7385-164"/> prayer book, gold-crossed, red-edged, in one
                    hand, and a turquoise and gold-topped double scent-bottle and cobweb cambric handkerchief in the
                    other. She confesses in confidence to her pale lavender gloves that shehas done that which she ought
                    not to have done, and has left undone that which she ought to have done; making graceful little
                    salaams and undulations of head and body every two minutes. <persName corresp="#lgerard"
                        >Miladi</persName> confesses that she has gone to sleep. <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St.
                        John</persName> makes no pretence of kneeling at all: he leans, elbow on knee and head on hand,
                    and looks broken-hearted, as men have a way of doing in church.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon, no one at Felton thinks of attending Divine service. It is a fiat of <persName
                        corresp="#tgerard">Sir Thomas</persName>'s that no carriage, horses, or servants are to be taken
                    out more than once a day, and the two miles' walk is an insuperable impediment to <persName
                        corresp="#lgerard">Lady Gerard</persName>, and hardly less so to <persName
                        corresp="#cblessington">Constance</persName>.</p>
                <p>After luncheon the three ladies are sitting in the garden, with the prospect of four unbroken hours
                    of each other's companionship before them. Masses of calceolarias, geraniums, lobelias, are flaring
                    and flaunting around them—masses in which the perverted eye of modern horticulture sees its ideal of
                    beauty. Nature, in her gardening, never plants great, gaudy squares and ovals and rounds of red and
                    blue and yellow, without many shades of tenderest grey and green to soften and relieve them. Across
                    the grass <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName> comes lounging; his Sunday frock coat
                    sitting creaseless to his spare, sinewy figure. <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> hates
                    the sight of that coat: it reminds her so painfully, by its very unlikeness, of the singular garment
                    that forms the head and crown of her betrothed's scant wardrobe.</p>

                <p>One more chance for her! Fate generally gives us two or three chances before it allows us to consign

                        >Robert</persName> or <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName>. The man whose

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Nothing whatever,"</said> he replies, flushing angrily; and then they walk on

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"You look excessively cross, and have not uttered a word for the last half

                    at her own audacity) to see in what spirit he takes her impertinence.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"When I do not get civil answers to civil questions, I think it best to hold my

                    umbrella at the tall, yellow mulleins in the hedge.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"People's ideas differ as to what <hi rend="i">are</hi> civil questions,"</said>

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"How many times have you?"</said> she asks, coming down from her elevation of
                    offended dignity with a jump, and looking up at him with naïve, eager curiosity.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Questions should be answered in the order of priority in which they are
                        asked,"</said> he replies, with a smile of amusement at her simplicity, but with a good deal of
                    dissatisfied <pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7385-176"/> doubt underlying the smile. <said who="#sjgerard"

                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> turns away, and passes her hand along the hedge,
                    catching idly at any grasses or flowers that come in her way, to the great detriment of her Sunday
                    gloves. His anxiety overcomes his hurt pride.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Give me an answer one way or another,"</said> he says, breathing rather short.
                        <said who="#sjgerard">"Is there not something between you and him?"</said></p>
                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> is silent. "No" is a plain downright lie, at which

                        corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName>'s side out into the drear, great world for ever.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"For God's sake answer me!"</said> he says again, in great agitation at a
                    dumbness that seems to him ominous.</p>
                <p>Hearing the sharp pain and angry fear in his voice, she hesitates no longer. Lie or no lie, she takes
                    the plunge. <said who="#ecraven">"Nothing!"</said> she says, faintly, turning first milk-white, then
                    red as a rose in her burning prime.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Why do you turn away your face? Are you quite certain?"</said> he asks,
                    quickly, only half convinced by her weak negation.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Certain,"</said> she replies, indistinctly, as if just able to echo his words,
                    but not to frame any of her own.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Why do you stammer and blush, then, whenever his name is mentioned?"</said> he
                    asks, with jealous impatience.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"I won't stand being catechised in this way,"</said> she cries, blazing out
                    angrily, and stopping short, while sparks of fire, half quenched in tears of vexation, dart from the
                    splendid night of her eyes. <said who="#ecraven"> "I have answered a question which you ought never
                        to have asked; you must be a person of very little observation,"</said> she continues, sharply,
                        <said who="#ecraven">"not to have discovered during the three weeks that I have been with you

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Or yours, if you like,"</said> she answers, hardily, but crimsoning painfully
                    meanwhile in confirmation of her words.</p>
                <p>At a little distance farther on, their path forsakes the road and leads across a line of grass
                    fields. St. John crosses the first stile, and waits politely on the other side to help Esther
                    over.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"No, no !"</said> she cries, petulantly, withdrawing her foot from the first

                <p>He obeys, and walks on. Her dignity does not allow her to hurry her pace to overtake him, nor does
                    his permit him to slacken his steps till she come up with him; and they walk on in single file,
                    goose-fashion, through two fields and a half.</p>
                <p>Dividing and watering the third field, as the four ancient rivers divided and watered the rose
                    gardens and asphodel fields of Paradise, a little beck, with many turns and bends and doublings back
                    upon itself, strays babbling, like a silver ribbon twisted among the meadow's green hair. It is not
                    like the Welsh brooks, fretful and brawling, making little waterfalls and whirlpools and eddies over
                    and about every water-worn stone; smoothly it flows on, as a holy, eventless life flows towards the
                    broad sea whose tides wash the shores of Time. In dry weather it is slow-paced enough, and crystal
                    clear; now the late heavy rains have quickened its current, and rolled it along, turbid and muddy.
                    Even though swollen, however, it is still but a narrow thread, and St. John clears it at a jump.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Shall I go on still?"</said> he asks, with a malicious smile from the other
                    side, addressing <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>, who stands looking <pb n="174"
                        xml:id="VAB7385-178"/> down rather ruefully at the quick, brown water at her feet.</p>
                <p><said>"I believe you knew of this, and brought me here on purpose to make a fool of me,"</said> she
                    cries, reproachfully.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"I did nothing of the kind,"</said> he answers, quietly. <said who="#sjgerard"

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"The very fact of my having already had so many obligations to you makes me

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"If you can suggest any better plan, I shall be delighted to assist you in
                        carrying it out,"</said> rejoins he, smothering a smile.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"I'll jump!"</said> she says, desperately, eyeing meanwhile the hurrying stream
                    and space between bank and bank with calculating look.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"You cannot,"</said> he cries, hastily; <said who="#sjgerard">" you'll get a

                <p>The word "silly" acts as a whip and spur to Essie's flagging courage. She retreats a few yards from
                    the <pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7385-179"/> edge, in order to get a little run to give her a better

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"As headstrong as an allegory on the banks of the Nile !"</said> remarks

                    his arms.</p>
                <p>Neither the preparatory run, nor the tremendous bound she takes, avail to save <persName

                    shortness of her legs render unavoidable. She jumps short, and falls forward on the wet bank; her
                    lavender kid gloves digging convulsively into it, and her legs disporting themselves fish-like in
                    the brook.</p>
                <p>He is at her side in an instant, raises gently and lifts her on to the grass, unmindful of the

                        deserve it, as I see you are longing to do? Anything would be better than standing there like a
                        stock or a stone!"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"It is not of much consequence how I stand or how I look,"</said> he replies,

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"I will walk as I am,"</said> she cries impulsively, springing to her feet;
                        <said who="#ecraven">"it will be a fit penance for my idiocy, and you shall go on ahead. I don't
                        want you to be disgraced by being seen in company with such an object."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"That is very probable, isn't it?"</said> he answers, laughing good-humouredly.
                        <said who="#sjgerard">"No, I have a better proposition than that, I think. It has just occurred
                        to me that an old servant <pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7385-180"/> of ours lives at no great distance
                        from here, her cottage is not more than three or four fields off. If you can manage to get there

                    or stiffness has fled, clings to her limbs and defines their form; the water drips down from her in
                    a thousand little spouts and rivulets; bang, bang, go her soaked petticoats against her ankles at
                    every step she takes.</p>

                    of potato ground and plot of pinks and marigolds and larkspurs—an oasis of tilled ground among the

                <p><persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName> remains in the outer room, looks at the clock,
                    behind whose dial-plate a round china-moon-face peeps out; takes up the mugs on the dresser: "For a
                    Good Boy," "A Keepsake from Melford," "A Present from Manchester," hiding amongst numberless gilt
                    flourishes; chivies the tabby cat; counts the flitches of bacon hanging from the rafters; walks to
                    the door, and watches the bees crawling in and out of the low door of their straw houses, and the
                    maroon velvet nasturtiums trailing along the borders, and lifting their round leaves and dark faces
                    up to the knees of the standard rose.</p>
                <p>As he so stands, whistling softly and musing, some one joins him in the doorway. He turns and beholds
                        <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>, bashful, shame-faced, metamorphosed. To
                        <persName corresp="#mrsbrown">Mrs. Brown</persName>'s surprise, she has declined the magnanimous
                    offer of her best black silk. There is nothing coquettish or picturesque, <pb n="178"
                        xml:id="VAB7385-182"/> as she is aware, about an ill-made dress that tries to follow the fashion
                    and fails—destined, too, for a woman treble her size. She has chosen in preference, a short, dark,
                    linsey petticoat and lilac cotton bedgown, which, by its looseness, can adapt itself to the round
                    slenderness of her tall, lissom figure. Her bonnet was not included in the ruin of her other
                    garments, but she has taken it off, as destructive to the harmony of her costume.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName> surveys her for some moments: looks upward from
                    petticoat to bedgown, and downward from bedgown to petticoat, but observes a discreet silence.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Does it become me?"</said> she asks at last, with shy vanity. <said

                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> looks mortified, and turns away.</p>
                <p>The cleansing of <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName>'s garments is a lengthy
                    operation. <persName corresp="#mrsbrown">Mrs. Brown</persName> retreats into her back kitchen, draws
                    forward a washtub, kneels down beside it, turns up her sleeves, and with much splashing of hot water
                    and lathering of soap, rubs and scrubs, rings out, dries, and irons the luckless gown and
                    petticoat.</p>
                <p>It is latish and duskish by the time that <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName> and <pb
                        n="179" xml:id="VAB7385-183"/> his companion set out on their homeward way. Two or three
                    starflowers have already stolen out, and are blossoming, infinitely distant, in the meadows of the
                    sky. They are not loquacious: it is the little shallow rivulet that brawls; the great deep river
                    runs still. Silently they walk along; her little feet trip softly through the rustling grass beside
                    him: the evening wind blows her light garments against him. He has taken her little gloveless hand
                    as he helps her over a stile (adversity has made her abject, and she no longer spurns his
                    assistance), and now retains it, half absently. Bare palm to bare palm, they saunter through the
                    rich, dim land. It is dusk, but not so dusk but that they can see their dark eyes flashing into one
                    another: sharp, stinging pleasure shoots along their young, full veins. The vocabularies of pain and
                    of delight are so meagre, that each has to borrow from the other to express its own highest height
                    and deepest depth. As they pass along a lane, whose high grass banks and overgrown hawthorn hedges
                    make the coming night already come, <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s foot stumbles
                    over a stone. The next moment she is in his arms, and he is kissing her repeatedly.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard"><persName corresp="#ecraven">"Esther</persName>, will you marry me?"</said> he
                    asks, in a passionate whisper, forgetting to make any graceful periphrasis to explain his meaning,
                    using the plain words as they rise in his heart.</p>
                <p>No answer. Emotions as complicated as intense check the passage of her voice. Even here, on this
                    highest pinnacle of bliss—pinnacle so high that she had hardly dared hope ever to climb there—the
                    thought of <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Bob</persName> and his despair flashes before her: her own
                    remarks about the senselessness of kissing—about its being a custom suited only to savages, and her
                    own great aversion to it—recur to her with a stab of remorse.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"You won't?"</said> cries <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName>,
                    mistaking the cause of her <pb n="180" xml:id="VAB7385-184"/> silence, in a voice in which extreme
                    surprise and profound alarm and pain are mixed in equal quantities.</p>
                <p>Still no answer.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"If you have been making a fool of me all this time, you might, at least, have
                        the civility to tell me so,"</said> he says, in a voice so sternly cold that remorse, coyness,
                    and all other feelings merge into womanish fear.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Don't blame me before I deserve it,"</said> she says, with a faint smile. <said

                <p>She finishes her sentence on his breast.</p>
                <p>Perfect happiness never lasts more than two seconds in this world; at the end of that time <persName
                        corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName>'s doubts return. He puts her a little way from him, that

                    him voluntarily. Then, amazed at her own audacity, clothed with shame as with a garment, she tears
                    herself out of his arms, as in delightful surprise he catches her to his heart, and flies with

                    angel passed by the blood-painted lintels of Israel. Thoughts sweeter than virgin honey, thoughts
                    bitterer than gall, have kept her wakeful. Ere she went to bed, she spent three hours in writing

                    by the potter's; and so, in most things, she would have been. In most things, it was to her easier

                    sits down in the large empty room to await the resurrection of her lover. The sort of shy half-fear
                    which always assails her at his expected approach comes over her more strongly than ever. A distant
                    door bangs faintly somewhere about the house; then another nearer. <said who="#ecraven">" He is <pb
                            n="197" xml:id="VAB7385-201"/> coming !"</said> she says to herself, and the quick blood
                    rushes tingling to her fingers' ends.</p>
                <p>It is a hot night, and the tall French windows stand unshuttered and open. Some impulse of timid
                    coquetry urges her to flee from before him: she is ashamed that he should see the plain letters of
                    joy written on her face at his coming: she would fain have yet a few moments of the happiness of
                    expectancy, to whose delights those of reality are but seldom comparable. From the terrace a flight
                    of stone steps leads down, with many a twist, to the mere. In a minute <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Essie</persName> has run lightly down, and is standing by the water's edge.</p>
                <p>The dahlias are nodding their round drowsy heads, and the sentinel hollyhocks stand up stiff and
                    pompous with their clustered flower-spikes—rulers and law-givers among the flower-people; the little
                    ripples are biting with playful tooth the low sedge-banks, and the tall bulrush forest, whence the
                    coot and the waterhen families sailed out into life in the warm spring weather. To and fro rock the
                    heavy, lazy, water-lily leaves, whose bloom-time is past two months ago. Through her garden, the
                    sky, the high moon walks stately, holding her silver lamp, in whose light all things shine
                    deliciously.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Essie</persName> stands entranced. It seems to her like the intermediate
                    residence of some happy soul, freed from the world's toil and moil, shrived from sin, emancipated
                    from life, where it should dwell in tempered bliss till that last day when heaven's brighter
                    glories, stronger raptures, should burst upon and clothe it for aye. She strolls along the narrow
                    gravel path, bathing her hands with childish delight in the moonbeams, and then stoops and picks up
                    two or three little stones that the night's sweet alchemy has gifted with a bright short glory not
                    their own. So stooping, she hears a man's quick firm foot running down the garden <pb n="198"
                        xml:id="VAB7385-202"/> steps. She raises herself, and goes to meet him with <quote>"a

                    </said> she asks, holding up her pebbly treasures for him to look at.</p>
                <p>Not speaking, he takes the little pink palm, stones and all, into his hand, and looks into her face;
                    and then, as if yielding to a temptation that he hates, that he would fain resist, and to which,
                    being over-strong, he must yet succumb, he snatches her to his breast, and kisses her
                    fiercely—eyelids, lips, and neck—with a violence he is himself hardly conscious of.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Stop!"</said> she cries, surprised, half-shocked, pushing him away from her.
                        <said who="#ecraven">"What do you mean? You frighten me!"</said></p>
                <p>He recollects himself instantly, and releases her. <said who="#sjgerard">"It <hi rend="i">is</hi>

                <p>She looks up at him in blank astonishment. Has he gone mad? Is it the moonlight that has given him

                <p>Looking at her as she stands with upturned eyes, like some sweet prayerful saint or penitent
                    Magdalen, drawn by a cunning hand that has been resolved three centuries back into elemental

                        >Gerard</persName>'s resolution breaks a little; not his resolution of parting from her—<hi

                        <said who="#sjgerard">"Child!" </said> he cries, a little roughly, and yet with a half-groan,
                    placing a hand heavily on each of her shoulders—<said who="#sjgerard">"Child! why are you so pretty?

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"And yet,"</said> she answers, with a melancholy smile, <said who="#ecraven"

                    break under it. Her answering farewell is to fling herself upon his breast.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"I can no more say 'good-bye,' </said>"she says, desperately, in a passionate

                    eyes, and down through his eyes into his heart. Prisoned in those sweet, frail fetters, he feels
                    strength and name and fame ebbing from him, as Merlin's ebbed under Vivien's wily charm.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Is not it better to be tricked by such a woman,"</said> Passion whispers,

                    fretted through their little parts, and now the curtain has fallen. When next it rises, the
                    principal actress in this tragic drama is discovered lying full-dressed on her bed; her pretty face
                    buried—eyes, nose, and mouth—in the tumbled pillow; her little neat-shod feet hanging over the
                    bedside. She looks as if she had been thrown there, an inert, passive mass, by some spiteful giant.
                    Six miles away, at Lord —'s ball, the fiddles are squeaking, and the pink-and-green Chinese lanterns
                    swinging to and fro among the orange boughs in the slight wind made by the rustling dresses and
                    passing men and women. <persName corresp="#tgerard">Sir Thomas</persName>, with his hands in their
                    burst white gloves under his coat tails, and his blue-cloth back leaning against a marble
                    mantel-piece, is talking sweetly, in his hard, rasping voice, of scab and foot-rot. <persName
                        corresp="#lgerard">Miladi</persName> is gone down to supper for the sixth time on the sixth
                    devoted married man's arm; she is eating game pie, and drinking sherry and champagne and moselle in

                    superciliously to a presumptuous younger son, who, annihilated by her Greek profile and Juno bust,
                    has invited her to tread a measure with him.</p>

                    she had tried to keep shadow and substance: <persName corresp="#sjgerard">Gerard</persName>'s love,
                        <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Brandon</persName>'s liking. Now, lo! both have fallen into the

                    the Elders"—are the vineries, pineries, peacheries. Did they ever exist? or were they only a mirage,
                    such as the sky presents to us sometimes—a mirage of ships shocking together, of armed men meeting

                        to-morrow: men in real life are not like men in novels—changeless of purpose, hard as iron or
                        adamant. What they are one half-hour, they are the exact reverse of the next; what they swear
                        to-night they will unswear to-morrow."</said> As Hope, the deceiver, thus murmurs, there comes
                    to her ear the sound of wheels briskly rolling to the door. <said who="#ecraven">"Is the ball over
                        so early? are they come back already? or—"</said> She does not give herself time to speculate on
                    any other hypothesis, but, springing from the bed, runs to the window, draws aside curtain and
                    blind, and looks out. The hall-door is open; a vehicle stands before it. The moonlight and the light
                    shed from the hanging-lamp in the portico are fighting together, struggling for possession of a
                    horse and dog-cart, of two footmen's floured <pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7385-218"/> heads, and of a
                    portmanteau and hat-box that they are carrying out. <sound>"Thud! thud!" </sound> she hears the
                    portmanteau go in at the back of the cart. Then a man comes out—a man in hat and overcoat—drawing on
                    dogskin gloves, and saying, <said who="#sjgerard">"John, go and look for my box of cigar-lights; I
                        left it on the smoking-room table."</said> It is <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St.
                        John</persName>, speaking in much his usual voice. He is going away! going away! and he can
                    think of his cigar-lights! Her heart stops pulsing for a second, then sets off galloping at the rate
                    of a hundred and twenty a minute. Going without making any sign! She leans further out of the
                    window, and rests her white arms, that look whiter than any lilies in the moonlight, on the sill. He
                    is so close beneath her, if the servants were not there, she might call to him; as it is, he will
                    never know that she has watched his departure. A sudden impulse prompts her to throw up the window
                    higher, to rustle her dress, to cough, in order to attract his attention. At the unexpected noise
                    John and Thomas turn their heads and look up, but their master does not. He gives a slight start,
                    but, instantly recovering himself, walks steadily to the cart and gets in. Then she knows that he
                    knows that she is looking at him—knows that he is resolute to part from her—<quote><l rend="center"
                            >"taking no farewell—"</l></quote> as Lancelot took none of Elaine.</p>
                <p>The horse is a little fidgety at starting. <said who="#sjgerard">"Wo-o-o! Gently, old lass!" </said>
                    This is the affecting form that <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName>'s last words take.
                    She cranes her neck out of the window; she leans out her lithe body, reckless of the danger of
                    losing her balance and tumbling on the hard gravel drive below, in her eagerness to catch the last
                    glimpse of the lessening, dwindling bulk; then, forgetting to shut the window, careless of any cold
                    or stock of rheumatism that she might be <pb n="215" xml:id="VAB7385-219"/> laying up for herself,
                    she returns to her former position, flings herself again prone on her bed, again buries her face in
                    the pillow; but this time no beguiling hope sits and whispers pleasant falsities to her. Hope got up
                    upon the dog-cart, and drove away with <persName corresp="#sjgerard">Gerard</persName>.</p>
                <p>The night wanes; morning dreams, that they say come true, invade many sleepers' brains. At Lord —'s
                    ball people are still dancing with the fury produced by champagne and supper; but <persName
                        corresp="#tgerard">Sir Thomas</persName>, <persName corresp="#lgerard">Miladi</persName>, and
                        <persName corresp="#cblessington">Miss Blessington</persName>, are at home again, and in bed.
                        <persName corresp="#cblessington">Constance</persName> is not one of those hard dancers who
                    think that one after supper- galop is worth ten ante-cœnal ones. Not for all the entrancing valses
                    Strauss ever composed would she run the risk of damaging the freshness of her toilette, nor the
                    still more serious risk of exchanging the marble coolness of her cheeks for the unsightly flush of
                    heat or the ugly pallor of exhaustion.</p>
                <p>Dawn is just beginning stealthily to unlatch the eastern gate; her torch, new-lit, makes but a puny
                    opponent for the night's one great and myriad lesser lamps. <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName> has fallen into an uneasy doze, her damp brow and loosened hair resting on
                    her bare, outflung arm. Suddenly a knock at her door makes her start up in a vague, confused horror.
                    Is it <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName> come back? Is it some one come to murder
                    her? A thousand impossibilities flash across her bewildered brain. Without waiting for permission,
                    the person who knocked enters; not <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName>, nor a
                    murderer—only a dishevelled housemaid, who has evidently just thrown a gown over her night attire,
                    and endeavoured abortively to gather up the straggling hair out of her sleepy eyes under a muslin
                    cap put on awry.</p>
                <p><said who="#housemaid">"A tallygraph for you, miss!" </said> says she, coming forward, holding in one
                    hand a blue envelope, and in the other a tall, solemn tallow candle, as sleepy as herself.</p>

                <p>A telegraphic message! Oh hateful telegraph! Cruellest of modern inventions ! Oh hastener of evil
                    tidings, that, without you, come all too speedily! Oh maker of sick hearts and blanched cheeks and

                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> snatches it, while a sudden, awful cold grasps her

                <p>"<persName corresp="#rbrandon">Robert Brandon</persName> to <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther

                <p>With how few pen-strokes can a death-warrant be written! For a moment she sits bolt upright, void of
                    breath or motion, as a white dead woman, from the house of whose fair body the spirit departed an
                    hour ago; the telegram grasped in a stiff hand that knows not of it. Then consciousness returns,
                    brought back by a huge, tearing, killing agony; then even the agony yields to one intense, consuming
                    longing—one all-dominating purpose-the longing to slay time and space; to be with him <hi rend="i"
                        >now</hi>, this instant; to be beside <persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName> dying, not

                <p><said who="#housemaid">"Indeed, 'm, you don't say so;"</said> replies the servant, growing broadly
                    awake under the delightful excitement of a calamity having happened to somebody, and of herself
                    being the first recipient of the news.</p>

                    head, and then springing off the bed and walking quickly towards the door.</p>
                <p><said who="#housemaid">"See <persName corresp="#ecraven">Sir Thomas</persName>,"</said> repeats the
                    woman, the most unfeigned alarm painting itself on her broad face—<said>" <hi rend="i">now!</hi>
                        Indeed, ma'am, you must be mad to think of such a thing! It would be as much as all our places

                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> turns and clutches her arm, while her great eyes
                    brimful of despair, burn on her face. <said who="#ecraven">"I tell you my brother is <hi rend="i"
                            >dying!</hi>" </said> she says, hoarsely—<said who="#ecraven">"I know he is; I must go to
                        him <hi rend="i">this minute</hi>; for God's sake help me to get to the station!"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#housemaid">"Indeed, 'm, I'm sorry to see you in such trouble, <hi rend="i">that</hi> I
                        am!" </said> answers her companion, moved to compassion by the terrible, haggard misery of the
                    young, round face, that she, in company with her fellow-servants, had often admired in its happy,
                    dewy rosiness at prayers on Sunday evenings; <said who="#housemaid">"but, you see, all the men are
                        in bed, and Simpson 'ud cut off his own 'ead afore he'd venture to take out the carriage without

                <p>The tall, yellow candle flares between them: lights up the tortured beauty of the one woman, the
                    placid stolidity of the other. <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> groans, and smites her
                    hands together.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Is there <hi rend="i">no</hi> vehicle I can have?"</said> she asks in impatient
                        agony—<said who="#ecraven">"no cart?—no anything? I'd give all I have in the world to any one
                        who would take me. Oh God! how many minutes I am wasting."</said></p>
                <p>The housemaid puts down her flat candlestick on the table, and rubs her forehead with her rough
                    fore-finger to aid her thinking powers. <said who="#housemaid">"There's the dog-cart that the
                        under-servants goes to church in,"</said> she says, presently, with an uncertain suggestion:
                        <said who="#housemaid">"if we could knock the men up, you might have <hi rend="i">it</hi>,
                        perhaps."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">" Knock them up this instant, then!" </said> cries <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName>, with passionate urgency—<said who="#ecraven">" <hi rend="i">now, this
                            minute!</hi> Go, for God's sake!" </said></p>
                <p>So saying, she almost pushes the woman out of the room, and herself follows her. Through long
                    passages and corridors, full of emptiness and darkness—darkness utter and complete, save where
                    through the gallery's high-stained east window the chilly. chilly dawn comes peeping, with a <pb
                        n="218" xml:id="VAB7385-222"/> grey glimmer, about the black frames, never closing eyes, and
                    stiff, prim simpers of the family portraits—down to the lower regions, where the huge kitchen-grate
                    yawns, black as Erebus—up steep back-stairs along other passages. In one of these passages <persName
                        corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> stands, her frame trembling and teeth chattering with cold
                    and nervous excitement, while her companion raps with broad, hard knuckles on a door, and loudly
                    calls on Simpson to awake. But hard workers are hard sleepers, and it is some time before the
                    coachman can be induced to leave the country of slumber. When at length he is aroused, and has come
                    out to them, in all the yawning sulkiness of disturbed sleep, it is a still longer time before he
                    can be induced to admit the possibility of any vehicle whatever being put at <persName
                        corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s disposal. with so righteous a fear of his wrath has
                        <persName corresp="#tgerard">Sir Thomas</persName> succeeded in inspiring his subordinates.</p>
                <p>It is not without the aid of all her remaining money, with the exception of what is needed for the
                    purchase of her railway ticket—not without the aid of all that is left of poor <persName
                        corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName>'s hardly-spared five-pound note—that she is able at length to
                    induce him to consent to the getting ready of the dog-cart "in which the under-servants goes to
                    church." Fully three-quarters of an hour more elapse before one of the helpers can be knocked up,
                    can dress himself, can harness the oldest and screwiest horse in the stables, and put him, with many
                    a muttered grumble, into the cart. Wretched <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> follows
                    the man and his lanthorn to the stable-yard, with the vain idea that her presence may hurry his
                    movements. During most of the three-quarters of an hour she walks quickly up and down over the hard,
                    round stones with which the yard is paved, or stands watching, with greedy eyes, every step in the
                    harnessing process; while her hands clench themselves, as his are clenched who is dead by some very
                    cruel, violent <pb n="219" xml:id="VAB7385-223"/> death, and a pain like a red-hot, two-bladed knife
                    keeps running through her heart. Before the horse is well between the shafts, she has climbed into
                    the cart and taken her seat.</p>
                <p><said who="#groom">"The luggage is not in yet, 'm,"</said> suggests the groom, respectfully.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Oh! never mind the luggage,"</said> cries <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName>, feverishly; <said>"I don't want it! I don't want anything! I'm ready! Get

                <p>Dawn is breaking, slowly, coldly, greyly, without any of the rose-coloured splendours that mostly
                    gild the day's childhood, as the glorious delusions of youth gild our morning, There has not been a
                    positive, actual frost in the night—not frost enough to congeal the wayside pools or to kill the
                    dahlias—but the air has, for all that, a frosty crispness, as of the first breath of coming winter.
                    The trees and hedgerow holly-bushes loom gigantic, formless, treble and quadruple their real size,
                    folded round and round in a mantle of mist; the meadows are like lakes of mist; sheets of vapour
                    steaming damply up to the shapeless, colourless, low-stooping heavens. <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName> has forgotten to take any wrap: through the poor protection of her thin

                    cold.</p>
                <p>At the turnpike gate a sleepy old man comes hobbling out (men at toll-gates are mostly one-legged),

                <p>Unmindful of the presence of the careless, indifferent onlookers, Esther clasps her cold hands
                    together and groans. In a great despair, as in a great bodily agony, we do not much mind who sees or
                    hears us.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Too late!"</said> she says, with a heavy, tearless sob—<said>" five minutes too
                        late! Oh God, it <hi rend="i">is</hi> hard!"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#porter">"Any luggage, Miss?"</said> asks the porter, in his civil, matter-of-fact
                    voice.</p>
                <p>The common-place question brings her back to life. <said who="#ecraven">"No, none,"</said> she
                    answers, collecting herself; and so saying walks <pb n="221" xml:id="VAB7385-225"/> into the
                    station, and, taking refuge in the waiting-room, sinks down upon a green Utrecht velvet chair.</p>
                <p>Owing to the earliness of the hour, other occupant of the room is there none; neither is there any
                    fire (a fire always looks in good spirits; it never has the blues). Alongside of the empty
                    fire-place stands a stiff, green Utrecht velvet sofa, and round the bare table more green Utrecht
                    velvet chairs. Opposite to <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>, against the wall, hangs a
                    roll of texts. Involuntarily her haggard eyes lift themselves to them, and light upon this
                    one—which, under the slightly inappropriate title of "Encouragements to Repentance," heads the list:
                        <quote>"Woe to me, for I am undone!" </quote> She shudders, <said who="#ecraven">"Is it an
                        omen?"</said> turns away her head quickly, and tries to look out of window, but the wire-blind
                    hinders her gaze. Once again, <quote>"Woe is me, for I am undone!"</quote> standing out clear and
                    black in large type from the white paper, greets her eyes. She can bear it no longer, but rising
                    hastily, runs out, and begins to walk swiftly up and down the platform.</p>
                <p>Brainton is a large station—a junction of many lines. Engines are snorting and puffing about; boilers
                    letting off steam, with a noise calculated to break the drum of any ear; tarpaulin-covered waggons
                    standing shunted on side lines. A train has just come in, and is disgorging its human load; a man
                    with a hammer is walking along by the side of it, stooping and tapping the wheels; porters are
                    driving luggage-piled trucks before them, and shouting out, <said>"By your leave!" </said> to any
                    unwary traveller who may cross the relentless path of their Juggernaut: other parties are enduring
                    and answering, with angelic patience and <hi rend="i"><foreign xml:lang="fr"
                    >bonhomie</foreign></hi>, the agitated and incoherent questions of unprotected females in waterproof
                    cloaks and turn-down hats. Everybody and everything is rampantly <hi rend="i">alive</hi>; even to
                    his handiwork, man seems to have imparted some of his own intense vitality; <pb n="222"
                        xml:id="VAB7385-226"/> to the engines he has given motion and voice—motion and voice ten
                    thousandfold stronger than his own.</p>
                <p>In her hurried walks, <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> suddenly comes face to face with
                    a fair-haired youth, who, followed by a porter carrying a gun-case, is walking lightly along with
                    his hands in his pockets, whistling for very lightheartedness, <quote><l rend="center">"I paddle my
                            own canoe."</l></quote></p>
                <p><persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName>'s tune! What business has he to whistle it? All
                    fair-haired youths, with nothing very prominent in any of their features, are more or less alike;
                    and this amount of resemblance the unknown bears to her boy. Long after he has passed her, amid the
                    shrieking of the engines, the shouts of the porters—<said who="#porter">"Take your seats for
                        Wolverhampton, Birmingham!"</said>
                    <said who="#porter">"All here for Chester, Warrington, and Manchester?"</said>—the well-known tune
                    echos faintly back to her ears. An overpowering, blinding, deafening rush of feeling comes over her;
                    she sits down hastily on a bench that is near at hand, in close proximity to an Irish labourer, with
                    a blue-spotted bundle, and, careless of the contaminating contact, buries her head in her hands, and
                    rocks to and fro in a paroxysm of despair.</p>
                <p>It is one of those incontrovertible facts that we all know to be true, and that we all feel to be
                    false, that every hour is of the same length; that in an hour of Elysium there are sixty whole
                    minutes, and that in an hour of Hades there are only sixty. In <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName>'s hour of waiting there are, however, seventy-five minutes, as the train is a
                    quarter of an hour late.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Is it a fast train?"</said> she asks eagerly of the bearded guard, who, with
                    the politeness inborn in guards, opens the carriage-door for her.</p>
                <p><said who="#porter">"No, miss,"</said> he answers, with suavity—<said who="#porter">"slow train, <pb
                            n="223" xml:id="VAB7385-227"/> miss; stops at every station; 6.10 was the fast train, miss!"
                    </said></p>
                <p>Off at last, sliding slowly at first past platform, officials, trucks, book-stalls, dowdy women and
                    dusty men; then the wind comes beating with a strong rush against <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName>'s cheeks, blowing back her hair, as they fly through the air at the rate of
                    fifty miles an hour.</p>
                <p>The transit from Brainton to Berwyn occupies three hours, and during the greater part of that time
                        <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName> maintains almost exactly the same attitude;
                    with her greedy eyes devouring every field and tree and homestead as they run past—each village
                    spire and bridge a finger-post to tell her that she is so much nearer her boy. She does not cry at
                    all, or groan. Even had she wished to do so, conventionality—that makes us laugh when we would fain
                    weep, makes us weep when we would fain laugh—would have forbidden her, for she is not alone in the
                    carriage. Two other travellers share it with her—two extremely cheerful young men, to whom it is a
                    matter of supreme indifference how many hedges and meadows are before, how many behind them. They
                    are not exactly gentlemen: and indeed it is a matter of almost as curious inquiry as what becomes of
                    all the pins that are made and lost, in what part of the train, if it be not in the guard's van,
                    gentlemen and ladies travel, as assuredly they are but seldom to be met with in first-class
                    carriages. The two youths have made themselves and their hat-boxes, rugs, &amp;c., luxuriously
                    comfortable, and seem rather disposed to be funny—to "show off," as children say, for the benefit of
                    the lovely girl, who looks so disconsolate and dishevelled, who seems so unflatteringly unaware of
                    their presence. They eat sandwiches and drink sherry; they are provided with a large stock of all
                    the morning papers, and by-and-by the eldest and boldest of them proffers <hi rend="i">Punch</hi>,
                        <hi rend="i">Fun</hi>, and half-a-dozen other dreary comicalities <pb n="224"
                        xml:id="VAB7385-228"/> to <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>. She looks at him for a
                    second with her large wistful eyes as she declines the offered civility, and then resumes her watch.
                    Having obtained that one short glance, he ceases from his witticisms, half-conscious of being in the
                    company of a great sorrow—as we involuntarily hush our voices and speak softly in the presence of
                    our great master and owner—Death. Perhaps, cowardly slaves as we are, we fear lest, if we should
                    speak loudly, he might be reminded of our existence—might lay his heavy hand on our shoulders
                    also.</p>
                <p>Another hour of waiting at Berwyn—another hour before there is any train for the branch line that
                    leads to Glan-yr-Afon—any train, at least, that stops at so insignificant a station. Another hour of
                    tramping in forlorn, impotent impatience up and down the platform, hustled by a hurrying crowd, who
                    know nothing, and care, if possible, less, about her and her grief. Well, if every one in England
                    wept for every one else's sorrows, the noise of tears and sobbings would drown the whirring of all
                    the mills in Leeds and Manchester—the booming of all the cannon at Shoeburyness. It is half an hour
                    past noon, when, almost before the train has stopped at the little wayside station, <persName
                        corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> springs out. She is the only passenger for Glan-yr-Afon;
                    and the man who unites in himself the functions of station-master and porter looks at her with a
                    recognising eye. He must know whether <persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName> is alive or dead.
                    He looks much as usual, but so he would whether Jack were alive or dead. Feeling an overmastering
                    sense of fear of and repugnance from the news he may have to give her, she runs to the little wicket
                    that leads out into the road.</p>
                <p><said>"Your ticket, please, miss!"</said> cries the man, following her.</p>
                <p>She had forgotten it; it takes a minute to extricate it from her glove; she thinks that he looks as
                    if he were going to speak; and, in a blind terror of what he might <pb n="225" xml:id="VAB7385-229"
                    /> say, turns from him and rushes down the road. Any suspense is better than some certainties.</p>

                <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> mountains stand still and drowsy in the sleepiness of midday. Through the
                    mistiness of the air, the russet glories of the dying bracken blaze on their breasts: the oak-woods
                    still keep their deep dusk green, but the sycamore has felt the kiss of winter, and is growing red
                    and sere beneath it. The sun is reigning, sole despot of the sky, having banished every rebel cloud
                    beyond the horizon's limits. It is almost always fine weather when we are most miserable. Whatever
                    poets say to the contrary, Nature is not sympathetic: rather is she very insolent to us in her
                    triumphant, durable beauty. She loves to say to us, <said>"Though you are weeping, my eyes are dry:
                        though you are very sick and feeble, I am strong and fair : though you are most short-lived,
                        here to-day and gone to-morrow, I am eternal, I <hi rend="i">endure</hi>."</said></p>
                <p>In the meadow below the house, <persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName>'s sheep are browsing—the
                    Cheviots that he was so proud of: down the stony, steep back-road the cart-horses come jogging, to
                    be watered at the pool at the hill-foot. With shortened breath and straining muscles, <persName
                        corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> runs fleetly past them, not daring to look into the
                    carter's face. Through the gate, by the stables, and then the familiar little old house comes in
                    sight, with its high-pitched roof and its old-fashioned chimney- pots. White pigeons are walking
                    about on the gravelled sweep, bowing and scraping, and making love, with a formal solemnity worthy
                    of Sir Charles Grandison. The Virginia creeper's scarlet banners wave from the wall; the hall-window
                    is open; on the ledge lies a tabby cat, with one eye <pb n="226" xml:id="VAB7385-230"/> open and the
                    other shut; two cocks are crowing in emulous rivalry in the farmyard. Everything looks peaceful,
                    happy, <hi rend="i">alive</hi>. Gathering a little feeble hope from these signs, <persName
                        corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> collects her small remnant of breath, and runs towards the
                    door. She has nearly reached it, when, stepping hastily out from the porch, one comes to meet her:
                        <hi rend="i">one</hi>, but not <hi rend="i">the</hi> one: he will pass through that porch but
                    once again, and then not of his own accord, but borne heavily on others' shoulders. Unable to frame
                    any speech, <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> looks up mutely in <persName
                        corresp="#rbrandon">Brandon</persName>'s face (for it is he), and there reads her doom. " He is
                    dead—he is dead!" she sees written wetly on either eye.</p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"He is better off than we are,"</said> says the young man, brokenly, taking
                    hold of both her hands.</p>
                <p>She sits down heavily on the bench in the porch: what hurry is there now? After all, it is but a poor
                    shabby remnant of us that Death gets when he makes his final claim upon us; in most of us the
                    greater, better part has died long before. Of <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>,
                    three-fourths died as she sat on the oak bench in the porch that autumn morning: breath remained,
                    and blood still circulated through veins and arteries, and speech and hearing were left ; but youth,
                    and hope, and heart, died very suddenly and utterly, to come back to life again never any more. She
                    sits staring vacantly at the seat opposite her for several minutes, and then speaks distinctly,
                    almost loudly: <said who="#ecraven">" "How long ago?"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"About eight,"</said> answers <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Brandon</persName>,
                    briefly and sadly, turning away his head to hide his womanish tears for the young fellow that fell
                    asleep so gently in his arms, in the early morning, when other folks were waking.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"What was it killed him?"</said> asks the girl, in the same hard, clear
                    voice.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#rbrandon">Bob</persName> looks at her in astonishment: he had been steeling
                    himself against faintings, hysterics, a, terrible scene of <pb n="227" xml:id="VAB7385-231"/>
                    shrieks and wailings, but this conscious stony collectedness fills him with a fearful surprise.</p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"It was diphtheria,"</said> he answers, sorrowfully taking her hand again, and
                    stroking it, while his hot tears fall thick upon it.</p>
                <p>She leaves it in his, passive as the hand of a statue, unknowing, indifferent, whether he held it or
                    not.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Did he suffer much?"</said> she inquires, lifting her lovely, hopeless eyes
                    piteously to his face.</p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"Not at the last,"</said> answers <persName corresp="#rbrandon"
                        >Brandon</persName>, evasively, almost under his breath.</p>
                <p>Silence for a few seconds: the cocks are still crowing, the pigeons courting the cat purring on the
                    window-sill: Nature is fond of these horrible contrasts.</p>
                <p>Presently she speaks again: <said who="#ecraven">"Why was not I sent for before?"</said> she asks in
                    a rough, harsh whisper.</p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"We telegraphed for you yesterday morning, the instant that we found there was
                        any danger,"</said> he replies, speaking very gently, but wincing a little under the reproach
                    implied in her question.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"And it did not reach me till this morning. If I had had it when I ought, I
                        suppose I should have been in time to see him,"</said> she says, with apathy, looking away
                    towards the misty hill.</p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"He sent you his love,"</said> says <persName corresp="#rbrandon"
                        >Brandon</persName>, struggling again with that same breaking in his voice. <said
                        who="#rbrandon">"Dear fellow! he was quite happy!"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Was he?"</said> she says, with the same vacant look. <said who="#ecraven">"I'll
                        go to him."</said> As she speaks, she rises and moves towards the door.</p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"You had better not,"</said> he says hastily, laying his hand on her
                    arm.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Why?"</said> inquires she, looking at him with perfect calmness; <said
                        who="#ecraven">"are you afraid of my fainting or going into <pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7385-232"/>
                        hysterics ? You need not be; it is only that I am not the least sorry that <persName
                            corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName> is dead, and that I want to be."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"It is not that,"</said> he answers, earnestly; <said who="#rbrandon">
                        "but—but—you know, dear, that it is a terribly infectious complaint."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Is it?"</said> she answers, a ray of animation lighting up her haggard face.
                        <said who="#ecraven">"I'm glad; perhaps God will let me catch it!"</said></p>

                    lying on the rug; seeing <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> enter, he raises himself
                    quickly, and goes to meet her, with heavy tail wagging and affectionate eyes, on which age is
                    written in blue dimness. Now that the master's sister has come home, he is sure that the master
                    cannot be far behind. He is waiting for him, waiting to walk round the farm; he has been waiting
                    this long time, thinking that he has gone upon a journey; and so he has. But oh! Luath, it is a
                    journey on which man may take neither horse nor dog, neither wife, nor sister, nor friend; a journey
                    on which some man, woman, or child is setting off every minute that beats; and whence no explorers
                    return, with maps and charts, and wondrous tales, to vaunt themselves of their exploits, and be
                    extolled and praised as benefactors to their race. Let us hope that it is because they find that
                    country most pleasant that they come not again. In the drawing-room a canary is shrilling his loud,
                    sharp song: they have thrown a shawl over his cage to keep him quiet; but through the shawl the sun
                    pierces, and the bird's keen clear jubilation goes up to meet it. How can he sing so very gaily now

                    holding one of his myriad courts. It is but a small, slightly furnished room in which he is holding

                    with the adventitious adjuncts of pomp and circumstance. Without his crown and sceptre, without his

                    setting out meekly, and not fearfully, in the autumn morning. Over the bed spreads a white sheet,
                    and beneath it a formless form!</p>

                        >Jack</persName>, to whom the shelter of a house was ever irksome, who was up and about at
                    cock-crow, to whom all weathers were the same, and the bracing wind blowing about the heathery hills
                    the very breath of his nostrils? A feeling of incredulity steals over her. She walks to the bed and
                    turns down the sheet from the face, and the incredulity deepens into incredulous awe. Oh, ye liars!
                    all ye that say that sleep and death are alike! what kinship is there between the pliant relaxer of
                    soft limbs, the light brief slumber, that, at any trivial noise, a trumpeting gnat or distant
                    calling voice, flies and is dissolved, and the grave stiff whiteness of that profoundest rest that
                        <pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7385-234"/> no thousand booming cannons, no rock-rending earthquake, no
                    earth-riving thunderbolt can break? It is an insult to that strong narcotic to liken any other
                    repose to that he gives. They have crossed the young fellow's hands upon his unheaving breast,
                    meekly, as the hands of one that prayeth; and laid sprigs of grey-flowered rosemary in them. She
                    looks at him steadfastly, a great, awful amazement in her dilated eyes. Is <hi rend="i">this</hi>
                    the boy that whistled <quote>" I paddle my own canoe "</quote>—whose step, glad and noisy, echoed
                    about the stairs?—the boy that sat and smoked at the study window, with her fond head resting on his
                    young slight shoulder?—the boy that was worried about failing crops and barren land?—the boy whose
                    laugh had a sincerer ring in it than any one else's, who made so many jokes, and had such a light
                    heart? Can <hi rend="i">this</hi> be he—this white, awful, beautiful statue? Was ever crowned king,
                    in purple and minever, half so majestical as he, as he lies on his narrow bed in the scant poor
                    room, with that serene stern smile that only dead mouths wear on his solemn changed face—that smile
                    that seems to say, <said who="#jcraven">"I have overcome! I <hi rend="i">know</hi> !"</said></p>
                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s love for <persName corresp="#jcraven"

                    neither will she find him again on the earth's face, though she seek him carefully with tears. For
                    one instant it comes home to her; for one instant light darts into her soul—light keen and cruel as
                    the forked lightning flash that, on some mirk night, glares blinding bright into a dark room,
                    illumining every object as with the furnace-fires of hell! She sinks on her trembling knees by the

                    none durst move hand or foot. But since he cannot come to her, why should not she go to him? Has the
                    disease that slew him spent all its force on that one slight frame? Is not there enough of it left
                    to kill her too? It was Juliet's thought when she spake reproachingly to her dead Romeo, as she
                    looked into the empty poison-cup— <quote><l rend="ti-3">'Oh, churl! drink all and leave no friendly

                <p>Suddenly <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Brandon</persName>'s beseeching words recur to her: <said

                    </said> If she kiss him, he may give her the boon of death. Instantly she rises, and stooping over
                    him, lays her tremulous warm lips on his still cheek. The unearthly awful cold of the contact
                    between the dead and the living strikes a chilly shrinking along her veins and limbs; but not for
                    that shrinking does she desist. Again and again she kisses him, driven on by that strong drear hope,
                    saying moaningly, <said who="#ecraven">"My boy! my boy!—give it me! give it me!" </said> Then
                    unbelief comes back. This is not <persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName>: he is somewhere else.
                    She will find him by-and-by. This is very terrible, this present experience, but she catches herself
                    thinking she will tell <persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName> all about it when she sees him.
                    To the incredulity succeeds a stupid apathy. She sinks down upon her knees again, with her elbows
                    resting on the counterpane, and fixes her stony eyes upon the dead stripling; watches him; looks at
                    him steadfastly, without intermission; looks at <quote>"the shell of a flown bird,"</quote> as the
                    old philosopher very grandly said. She does not know how long she means to stay there; she does not
                        <pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7385-236"/> know how long she has already staid there ; when some one
                    entering, lays his hand upon her shoulder, and says, with kindly gravity, <said who="#rbrandon"
                        >"Come away, dear!"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"I am doing no harm!"</said> she answers dully, not moving her eyes.</p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"Come, darling!"</said> he says, not attempting to reason with her, but
                    speaking in the coaxing tone one would use to a fractious sickly child.</p>
                <p>She answers neither "Ay" nor "Nay;" she neither resists nor consents, and so, half carrying, half
                    leading, he takes her from the room, and they leave poor <persName corresp="#jcraven"

                <p>If ary one were to smite her on lip or cheek, neither would she resent it or complain; she sits in an
                    armchair, in the drawing-room, with her hands folded in her lap, and the servants bring her tea
                    every half-hour (incessant tea being supposed to be the necessary accompaniment of great grief), and

                        a sort of pleasant bit of a smile, and was gone all in a minute!" </said> It is very touching,
                    but it does not touch <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>. She rises and walks into the
                    hall, and looks at his greatcoat and his hat, and kisses his gloves, that seem to retain somewhat of
                    the shape of the kind hands that once filled them. She thinks resolutely of how he has been her one
                    friend throughout life; thinks of the presents he gave her, and of how seldom he went to any town
                    without bringing her some little remembrance back from it; thinks of that last five-pound note, so
                    hardly spared, and yet so very gladly given; thinks of how poor he was, how slight, how young. But
                    it is all no good; it seems to her like some pathetic tale about a <pb n="234" xml:id="VAB7385-238"
                    /> stranger that she is telling herself. And the days pass, and she grows weak from inanition, but
                    refuses all food. If she can be unnatural, horrible enough to feel hunger and thirst now <persName

                    and lies there half in sleep, half in insensibility. And the mornings and the evenings go by, and
                        <persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName>'s burial-day comes. They had hoped that it would
                    have passed without her knowing, but it was not so. Now that he is leaving his home for this last
                    time, he does not go light-springing down the stairs, as at other times, but with much tramping of
                    strange feet, with purposed muffling of strange voices. How can she fail to hear, <quote><l
                            rend="center">"The steps of the bearers heavy and slow?" </l></quote></p>
                <p>Through all her trance it breaks; from her little latticed window, with her sick limbs trembling
                    beneath her, and her miserable eyes nailed to the gaoler coffin, in whose strait custody her dead
                    lies prisoned, she sees the drooped pall and the black-scarfed mourners. These mourners are but few,
                    for Jack—though now awfuller than any absolutest monarch—was, in life, poor and of little
                    consequence: the gap made by the extinction of that one young life is but narrow. Standing there,
                    she feels a pang of bitter regret and anguish that there are not more people to be sorry for
                        <persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName>. And so, being weak, the fountains of her soul are
                    broken up within her, and she falls to weeping mightily; and, but for that weeping, she would,
                    perchance, have died, some say; but I think not—for why should grief, being our natural element,
                    kill us any more than water the fish, or air the bird?</p>

                <p>No one will ever abuse him or say anything ill-natured of him again; for to speak evil of the
                    helpless, speechless, answerless dead, requires a heart as bad, a nature as cowardly vile, as his
                    must be that foully murders a young child. And the mourners go home, and take off their hatbands and
                    scarves, and give them to their wives to make aprons of. And old Luath lies in the hall, watching
                    still, with ears attentively pricked at any incoming footstep, and hope drooping, as day droops too,
                    begins to howl dismally towards sun-down.</p>

                <p>And <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>—<said>"You ought not to grieve for him; it is a
                        happy change for him; he is in Heaven!"</said> So they had said to her weepingly, as people do
                    say to us, when the desire of our eyes has left us; but even as they spake them, she felt that they
                    were but words, hollow and empty as the greetings in the market-place with which we salute our
                    indifferent acquaintance. Was she so sure that the change had been a happy one? It was a change from
                    the known to the unknown, from moderate certain evils, and moderate probable good, to infinite
                    possibilities of horror or blessedness. Where lay this heaven, this promised land, where we so
                    confidently lodge our dead? Was it up above that highest bluest arch that looks in truth pure
                    enough, and solid enough, to be the floor of some sweet elysium? Ah! no! Human knowledge, that like
                    a naughty, prying child, has found out at once so infinitely too much and too little, tells us that
                    that skyey vault is but thin air. She thinks, shuddering—<said who="#ecraven">"What if heaven itself
                        be but thin air ? <hi rend="i">Is it anywhere?</hi> What if its existence at all be but the
                        fine-spun fancy of poor human hearts, that must needs frame for themselves some blessed definite
                        hope, since <hi rend="i">real</hi> hope have they none? Is it a beautiful tender fraud practised
                        by themselves upon themselves, to save them from the despair of the black vagueness into which
                        they must send out their departed ones, and go out themselves when life's little day is over?
                        Oh, light! light! When the great God said, <said>'Let there be light!'</said> in the material
                        world, why did not lie say so too in the world of spirits? I know that my soul shall live for
                        ever! I know that there is that within me over which the most insatiable of monsters,
                        insatiabler than any slain in classic tale—a monster that turns beauty to unsightliness, whose
                        handmaid is corruption, and whose drink is tears—has no power. But alas! alas! can I rejoice in
                        my immortality, when I know not where, or under <pb n="237" xml:id="VAB7385-241"/> what

                    Glan-yr-Afon. To reach it they have to climb through the waving woods, where the beeches and
                    sycamores emulously cast down their crimson and amber leaves to strew the path before their feet. To
                    reach it, they have to pass the woodman's stone cottage, his pigstye, and his little yap-yapping
                    rude dog. From the common you may look upwards or downwards—northwards, to the valley-head;

                    over the rock's rough face, the lichens, drab and yellow, make their little plans and charts. One
                    may fancy some former people of strong giants sleeping very sweetly beneath those unchiselled
                    tombstones, with their epitaphs written out fairly in Nature's hand in green mosses and rain
                    furrows. In spring the hill's harsh front is crowned with a yellow splendour of gorse-flowers, but
                    now a single blossom blows here and there desolate, just to hinder the old saying from being quite a

                        anything—I have proved that already, I think. Any one that had had any feeling would have died
                        of <hi rend="i">this</hi>; but I—I sleep and eat as well as ever: I am like the baker who
                        refused Christ the loaf—I <hi rend="i">cannot</hi> die!"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"Hush!"</said> he says, eagerly; <said who="#rbrandon">"don't want to go before
                        your time, or perhaps the Almighty might take you at your word."</said></p>
                <p>There is silence for a moment or two, then <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Brandon</persName> speaks
                    again: <said who="#rbrandon">"At the end of three weeks you will come to us then?"</said></p>
                <p>No answer.</p>
                <p>Thinking that the wind has carried away his words, he repeats his question: <said who="#rbrandon">"At
                        the end of three weeks you will come to us, then?" </said></p>
                <p>She turns her head round slowly. <said who="#ecraven">"Could not I live in some hovel by myself?"
                    </said></p>
                <p>He shakes his head. <said who="#rbrandon">"Impossible! You see,"</said> he says, speaking with slow
                    reluctance, <said who="#rbrandon">"he—poor dear fellow !—laid out a great deal of money on all the
                        latest improvements in farming implements, and things of that kind, and they did not bring him
                        anything back; they would have done, no doubt, if he had been given time,"</said> he adds,
                    quickly, afraid of seeming to cast the faintest slur upon the dead boy.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"You mean to say that I have no money—that I am a beggar,"</said> she says,
                    fixing her clear, steadfast eyes upon him: and in them is none of that dismay which her words seem
                    to imply.</p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"I mean to say,"</said> he answers, heartily, <said who="#rbrandon">"that
                        henceforth you are to be one of us, and that we are very, <hi rend="i">very</hi> glad of
                        it."</said></p>
                <p>She does not say "Thank you;" she neither assents nor <pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7385-247"/> refuses; she
                    only looks away, and watches the distant trees tossing violent arms, in riotous fight with the
                    wind.</p>
                <p>Something in her manner makes <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Brandon</persName> uneasy. <said
                        who="#rbrandon">"It is agreed, then ?"</said> he asks, eagerly.</p>
                <p>No reply.</p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"Why don't you answer me, <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>
                        ?"</said> (with a slight natural impatience in his tone).</p>
                <p>She turns her face slowly round towards him—a face paled by her late agonies, thinned by long
                    fastings, and by thousands of great tears. <said who="#ecraven">"Because,"</said> she replies, <said
                        who="#ecraven">"I have one friend in the world now; and when I have answered you, I shall have
                        none!"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"What <hi rend="i">do</hi> you mean?" </said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"If I were to come to you, I should come as your supposed future wife, shouldn't
                        I? Well, I should be an impostor."</said></p>
                <p>A great sickening fear whitens his brown face, but he contains himself, and speaks quietly: <said
                        who="#rbrandon">"Do you think I meant to <hi rend="i">bargain</hi> with you ? Do you think I
                        meant to make a profit for myself out of your troubles? What have I ever done to make you think
                        me so mean?"</said> he asks, reproachfully.</p>
                <p>She draws a heavy sighing breath. <said who="#ecraven">"Why am I beating about the bush ?"</said> she
                    says, chiding herself; <said who="#ecraven">"it must out, sooner or later ! Oh, <persName
                            corresp="#rbrandon">Bob</persName> ! <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Bob</persName> ! if I had
                        it in me to be sorry about anything, I should be sorry about this!"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"About what?"</said> he asks, cruelly excited. <said who="#rbrandon">"Look this
                        way, <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>. Is it—is it what I have been afraid of all
                        along ?"</said></p>
                <p>Her head sinks in shamed dejection on her breast. <said who="#ecraven">"Yes, it is,"</said> she
                    answers, faintly.</p>
                <p>There will be a great storm at sea to-night; the gulls are circling about, calling wildly to one
                    another-here, twenty miles inland.</p>

                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"Who is it?"</said> asks <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Bob</persName>, in a
                    husky whisper, presently.</p>
                <p>She sighs again, profoundly. <said who="#ecraven">"Do you remember,"</said> she says, <said
                        who="#ecraven"> "before I went to the Gerards'—how many hundred years ago was that?—your saying
                        one day that you wished they had not got a son, and my laughing at you about it? Well! you were
                        right!—it is he!"</said></p>
                <p><persName corresp="#rbrandon">Brandon</persName> turns away his head, speaks not, nor gives any sign.
                    It is in silence that a good brave man meetliest takes his deathblow.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"I don't think he would have cared much about me, if I had let him
                        alone,"</said> says <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>, taking a sort of gloomy
                    pleasure in painting herself as black as possible.</p>
                <p>There is a pause—a pause, during which <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Brandon</persName> is fighting
                    one of those duels in which most men have to engage at least once in their lives—the duel with a
                    mortal agony, that says, tauntingly, <said>"I am your master! I have conquered you!" </said> to
                    which one that is valiant makes answer, <said>"You are strong, you are terrible; but you are not my
                        master. I will keep you under!" </said></p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"You will go to him then, of course, instead of coming to us?"</said> he says,
                    presently, speaking in some one else's voice (for it certainly is not his own), and keeping his head
                    turned away; for no one is willing to parade their death-pangs before others' eyes.</p>
                <p>She laughs derisively. <said who="#ecraven">"Go to him! Hardly! I should get but an indifferent
                        welcome if I did. You know I never told him a word about you—ladylike and honourable of me,
                        wasn't it?—but some one else did him that good office; and now, if he were to see me falling
                        over the edge of that cliff, he would not put out a finger to save me. That is his sort of
                        love!" </said> She ends, bitterly, <said who="#ecraven">"And I think he is right."</said></p>
                <p>Another longer silence. <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Brandon</persName> is wrestling with that
                    adversary of his, that deadly anger and pain; that riotous <pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7385-249"/>
                    tigerish jealousy, that makes us all murderers for the time, in thought at least; that mad, wild
                    longing—madder, wilder than any love ardour, than any paroxysm of religious zeal—to have his hands,
                    for one moment of strong ecstasy. about the throat of the rich man that has robbed him of his one
                    ewe lamb. The sweat of that combat stands cold upon his brow, but he overcomes. After a while he
                    speaks gently, as one would speak to a little sick child: <said who="#ecraven">"Were you very fond
                        of him, <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>?"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"I suppose so,"</said> she answers with reflective calmness, looking straight
                    before her. <said who="#ecraven">"I must have been, or I should not have said and done the mean
                        things I did. I should not have degraded myself into begging him to take me back again, when I
                        might as well have begged of this rock"</said> (thrusting her soft hand against it) <said
                        who="#ecraven"> "to turn to grass and flowers. He told me that he would never forgive me, either
                        in this world or the next! I thought it very dreadful at the time, but I don't much care now
                        whether he forgives me or not."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"Have you forgotten him so completely already?"</said> asks <persName
                        corresp="#rbrandon">Bob</persName>, forgetting his own misery for the moment, in sheer blank
                    amazement.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Forgotten him!"</said> she repeats thoughtfully. <said who="#ecraven">"No, not
                        that I not that! I might as well try to forget myself. I remember every line of his face, his
                        voice, and his ways, and every word he said almost; but if I were to see him standing close to
                        us here, I should not feel the slightest inclination to go to him, or to call him to come to me.
                        I feel all dead everywhere."</said> They remain in the same attitude for several minutes,
                    neither of them stirring nor uttering a word. Then <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>
                    speaks, with a certain uneasy abruptness. <said who="#ecraven">"Well !"</said> she says, <said
                        who="#ecraven">"I am waiting!—waiting for you to call me a murderess and a bad woman, and all
                        the other names that <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName> gave me, on much less
                        provocation. <pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7385-250"/> Make haste!"</said> she says, with a nervous
                    forced laugh; <said who="#ecraven">"I am in a hurry to hear that I have succeeded in getting rid of
                        my last friend. Quick! quick!—tell me that you hate me, and have done with it!"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"<hi rend="i">Hate</hi> you!" </said> he repeats, tenderly; his brave voice
                    trembling a little in spite of himself, and the meekness of a great heroism ennobling his face.
                        <said who="#rbrandon">"You, poor soul! Why should I hate you because another man is better and
                        more loveable than I, and because you have eyes to see it?"</said></p>
                <p>The eyes he speaks of turn upon him, wide and startled, in astonished disbelief of his great
                    generosity.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"You don't understand!"</said> she says, quickly. <said who="#ecraven">"You
                        don't take it in. I was <hi rend="i">engaged</hi> to him; I was going to marry him, and all the
                        time I never once mentioned your name to him, of my own accord; and when he asked me about you,
                        I said you were only a common acquaintance. You <hi rend="i">must</hi> hate me!"</said> she
                    ends, vehemently; <said who="#ecraven">"don't pretend that you don't!"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"Hush!"</said> he answers sorrowfully, but very gently, <said who="#rbrandon"
                        >"that is nonsense! I don't even hate him; at least"</said> (pausing a moment, to thrust down
                    and trample under foot one more spasm of that intolerable burning jealousy)—<said who="#rbrandon"
                        >"at least, I try not. It was my own fault. I knew all along that I was poor, and stupid, and
                        awkward, that I had nothing but sheer love to give you, and I hoped against hope that that might
                        win you at last. We all set our affections upon some one thing, I suppose,"</said> he says, with
                    a patient, pitiful smile, <said who="#rbrandon">"and I daresay it is all the better for us in the
                        end that we don't often get it: but oh, love! love! you might have told me!" </said> Then his
                    resolution breaks a little, and, covering his face with his hands, he groans aloud, in a man's
                    dry-eyed agony—how much awfuller to see than a woman's little tears, that flow indifferently for a
                    dead pet dog, or a dead husband ! <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> sits looking at him
                    during several <pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7385-251"/> minutes, awestruck, as a child that has made a
                    grown-up person cry; then one of those quick impulses that carry some women away seizes her.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"<persName corresp="#rbrandon">Bob</persName>!"</said> she says, putting her
                    sweet mouth close to his ear, while her gentle, vibrating voice thrills down to his stricken soul,
                        <said who="#ecraven">"I have been very bad to you, but I will make up for it!"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"Will you?"</said> he says, looking up with a mournful, sceptical smile; <said
                        who="#rbrandon">"how?"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"I'll marry you, if you'll have me, and make a very good wife to you,"</said>
                    she says, simply, with unblushing calmness, eyelids unlowered, and voice unwavering.</p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"Child!"</said> he cries, <said who="#rbrandon">"you are very generous, but do
                        you think I cannot be generous too?"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"It is not generosity,"</said> she says, eagerly; <said>"I <hi rend="i"
                            >wish</hi> to marry you!"</said></p>
                <p>He shakes his head sadly. <said who="#rbrandon">"You don't know what you are saying,"</said> he
                    answers, taking her little hand between both his—holding it almost fatherly, in a tender prison.
                        <said who="#rbrandon">"You don't know what marriage is. You don't understand that a union so
                        close with a person you don't love would be infinitely worse than being tied to a dead body; the
                        one could not last very long, the other might for years."</said></p>
                <p>She looks at him silently, with her grave, innocent eyes, for an instant or two while she tries to
                    get down to the depth of her own heart—tries to feel something besides that numb vague indifference
                    to everything. <said who="#ecraven">"If I don't love you,"</said> she says, doubtfully, <said
                        who="#ecraven">"I love nobody; I like you better than anyone else in the world ! Didn't
                            <persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName> die in your arms?"</said> she says, breaking
                    out into sudden and violent tears. <said who="#ecraven">"Wasn't his head resting on your shoulder
                        when he went away? Oh, dear, dear shoulder!"</said> she cries, kissing it passionately. <said
                        who="#ecraven">"How can I help loving you for that?"</said></p>
                <p>At the touch of her soft mouth, that has been to him <pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7385-252"/> hitherto,
                    despite his nominal betrothal, a sealed book, his steadfast heart begins to pulse frantically fast:
                    if a river of flame instead of blood were poured through his veins, they could not have throbbed
                    with an insaner heat: his sober head swims as one that is dizzy with strong drink; reels in the
                    overpowering passion of a man that has not frittered away his heart in little bits, after our
                    nineteenth-century fashion, but has cast it down, whole, unscarred by any other smallest wound, at
                    one woman's feet. Oh, if he might but take her at her word! Or, if there must be no marriage between
                    them, why may not there be a brief sweet marriage of the lips? It would do her no harm—since kisses,
                    happily for the reputation of ninety-nine hundredths of the female world, leave no mark—and it would
                    set him for an instant on a pinnacle of bliss that would equal him with the high gods.</p>
                <p>But the paroxysm is short. Before she who has caused it has guessed at its existence, it is put down,
                    held down strongly. Women are very often like naughty children, putting a lighted match to a train
                    of gunpowder, and then surprised and frightened because there is an explosion.</p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"You are deceiving yourself,"</said> he says, speaking almost coldly. <said
                        who="#rbrandon">"You think you like me, because I happened to be the last person that was with
                        the dear fellow that's gone—because you knew that I was grieved about him too: but think of me
                        as you thought of me when you were at the Gerards', and you'll know how much you love me for
                        myself."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Love!"</said> she repeats, dreamily—<said who="#ecraven">"love! love!" </said>

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"You refuse me then?"</said> she says, with a sigh of half-unconscious relief.
                        <said who="#ecraven">"Was ever such a thing heard of? And I have not even the satisfaction of

                <p>The two young people sit silent; each looking down, as it were with inner eyes, on the wreck of their

                    curl about the dun hills: the clouds stoop low, as if to mingle with their sister mists. With many a
                    sigh, and with many a shiver, the trees shower down the ruddy rain of their leaves ; earth is
                    stripping her fair body for the winter sleep. Then Brandon speaks:</p>

                <p>He smiles slightly, yet very ruefully withal. <said who="#rbrandon">"My darling!"</said> he says,

                    Pensive musings upon the caducity of the human race are, generally, rather feminine than masculine.

                    piteously, and her faithful thoughts, that never wander far from it, straying back to the new bare
                    grave, where one half of that "<hi rend="i">we</hi>" lies sleeping—<said>"I thought that we should

                <p>A great yearning pity—purer, nobler, with less of the satyr and more of the god in it, than in any
                    access of human passion between man and woman—seizes him as he looks at her, sitting there so
                    forlorn, with one thin hand lifted to shield her weary purple-lidded eyes, that have grown dim with
                    weeping for "her boy."</p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"Poor little soul!"</said> he says, compassionately; and he takes, with
                    brotherly intimacy, the other hand, that lies listless in her lap, and lays fond lips upon it.</p>
                <p>When one is on the verge of a burst of crying, a harsh word may avert the catastrophe, but a kind one
                    inevitably precipitates it. With how unjust, unreasonable a hatred does one often regard the person
                    who ill-advisedly speaks that kind word! As for <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>, she
                    buries her face on his shoulder and begins to sob hysterically. Her hat falls off, and her bare,
                    defenceless head leans on his breast, while the autumn wind wafts one long lock of her scented hair
                    against his face. She has forgotten that he was her lover, has forgotten that he is a man; she
                    remembers only that he is a friend, which is a sexless thing—that he is the one being who cares
                    about her, in all the great, full, crowded world. Despite the utter abandonment of her attitude,
                    despite the clinging closeness of her soft supple form to his, he feels none of the painful stings
                    of passion that so lately beset him. They are tamed, for the moment, by a nobler emotion: they dare
                    as little assail him now, as they dare assail the holy saints in Paradise. With any other man such
                        <pb n="253" xml:id="VAB7385-257"/> abandonment might have been dangerous: with him she is safe.
                    He lays his kind broad hand on her ruffled head, and strokes it, just as <persName
                        corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName> used to do, in the pleasant days before he went.</p>

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Yes, I know that!—I know that!"</said> she answers, hastily; <said

                        so much already, that I am racking my brain to think how I can pay some part of it, instead of

                <head rend="center">CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
                <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> is Sunday evening. <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName> has been
                    to church for the first time since her <hi rend="i">bereavement</hi>, as people call it. She has
                    displayed her crape in all its crisp funeral newness before the eyes of the Plas Berwyn
                    congregation. Also, she has been made the subject of conversation, over their early dinner, between
                    the imbecile rector and his vinegar-faced, bob-curled wife; the latter remarking how unfortunately
                    unbecoming black was to poor <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName>—really impossible
                    to tell where her bonnet ended and her hair began; and how lucky it was for her that people did not
                    wear <pb n="257" xml:id="VAB7385-261"/> mourning for as long a time as they used—three months being
                        <hi rend="i">ample</hi> nowadays, <hi rend="i">ample</hi> for a brother! <persName
                        corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> has sat in their pew for the first time alone: she has
                    looked at <persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName>'s prayer-book, at his vacant corner under the
                    dusty cobwebbed window, with eyes dryly stoic; she has walked firmly after service down the
                    church-path, past a grassless hillock, where he who was her brother lies, dumbly submitting to the
                    one terrific, changeless law of decay—the law that not one of us can face, as applying to ourselves,
                    without our brains reeling at the horror of it. Oh! thrifty, harsh Nature! that, without a pang of
                    relenting, unmixes again those cunningest compounds that we call our bodies— making the freed
                    elements that formed them pass into new forms of life—makes us, who erewhile walked upright, god-
                    like, fronting the sun, communing with the high stars—makes <hi rend="i">us</hi>, I say, creep
                    many-legged in the beetle, crawl blind in the worm!</p>
                <p>It is evening now, and <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> sits, in her red armchair,
                    beside the drawing-room fire, <hi rend="i">alone</hi> again. The wind comes <hi rend="i"
                        >banging</hi> every minute against the shuttered French window, as one that boisterously asks to
                    be let in; the ivy leaves are dashed against the pane, as one that sighingly begs for admittance.
                    Every now and then the young girl looks round timidly over her shoulder, in the chill expectation of
                    seeing a death-pale spirit-face gazing at her from some corner of the room; every now and then she
                    starts nervously, as a hot cinder drops from the grate, or as the small feet of some restless mouse
                    make a hurry-skurrying noise behind the wainscot. As often as she can frame the smallest excuse, she
                    rings the bell, in order to gather a little courage from the live human face, the live human voice,
                    of the servant that answers it.</p>
                <p>Around Plas Berwyn also the wind thunders—against Plas Berwyn windows also the ivy-leaves fling
                    themselves <pb n="258" xml:id="VAB7385-262"/> plaintively; but there the resemblance ends. The
                    steady light from the lamp outblazes the uncertain, fitful fire-gleams: at Plas Berwyn there are no
                    ghost-faces of the lately dead to haunt the inmates of that cheerful room. They are all sitting
                    round the table on straight-backed chairs—no lolling in armchairs, no stealing of furtive naps on
                    the Sabbath—sitting rather primly, rather Puritanically, reading severely good books. To <persName
                        corresp="#rbrandon">Bob</persName>'s palate, the <hi rend="i">Hedley Vicarsian</hi> type of
                    literature is as distasteful as to any other young man of sound head and good digestion, but he
                    succumbs to it meekly, to please his mother; if Sunday came <hi rend="i">twice</hi> a week, I think
                    he would be constrained to rebel. From the kitchen, the servants' voices sound faintly audible above
                    the howling wind, singing psalms. The family are divided between prose and poetry. <persName
                        corresp="#ebrandon">Miss Brandon</persName> is reading a sermon; her sister a hymn. Here it
                    is:—</p>

                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"Why, in hindering that poor girl,"</said> he says, with warmth, <said
                        who="#rbrandon">"from being thrown upon the world penniless, helpless, and without a friend, as
                        she will be after the sale at Glan-yr-Afon."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#mrsbrandon">"Not without a friend, as long as you are alive, <persName

                        unless he is in some authorised position of relationship or connection with her; otherwise he
                        does her more harm than good. What <pb n="267" xml:id="VAB7385-271"/> she needs, and what I
                        hoped she would have found in you, mother, is a woman-friend."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#mrsbrandon">"If,"</said> replies his mother, drawing herself up and looking very
                        stiff—<said>"If she is, as you say, <hi rend="i">too proud</hi> to avail herself of the home
                        that I am, <hi rend="i">for your sake</hi>, willing to offer her, she is likely to be <hi

                    knees beside her, and clasping his arms about her withered neck, says, entreatingly: <said
                        who="#rbrandon">"Mother, why are you so hard upon her?—what has she done to you? Just think, how
                        would you have liked <persName corresp="#jbrandon">Jane</persName> or <persName

                <p>He had never spoken truer words in all his life, but the truth is not always the best to be

                        they were and are good, modest, pious girls, that would not trifle with an honest man's

                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"I never heard of any honest man having given them the chance,"</said> retorts
                        <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Bob</persName>, sarcastically, quitting his caressing posture,
                    with a revulsion of feeling as sudden as it was complete.</p>
                <p><said who="#jbrandon">"The servants are assembled,"</said> says the youngest, best, modestest,

                <p><said who="#rbrandon">"You need not wait for me, mother,"</said> he continues, seeing his parent look

                <p>T<hi rend="i">HE</hi> rough winds and the spiteful rains have wellnigh stripped all their
                    red-and-yellow clothing off the trees: upon the oaks alone some leaves still hang persistent, though
                    withered and crackly. The apples and pears are all gathered and stored for the winter; even the
                    dark-blue Orleans plums, that require the crisping frost to ripen them, are eaten and gone.</p>
                <p>The sale at Glan-yr-Afon is over; it is enrolled among that countless array of unrecallable events,
                    great and little, that is past. The new tenant, an ordinary Welsh farmer, with an overfull quiver of
                    sprouting Welshmen and Welshwomen, has entered into possession. No one has taken the trouble to
                        <distinct>"redd up "</distinct> the garden for the winter; flowers do not help to pay the
                    rent—they give back nothing but their beauty and perfume; and so, over <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName>'s trim flower-beds, sheep-dogs gallop, and children, boisterous with health
                    and spirits, run races. The rustic seat under the old cherry- tree—the seat that <persName
                        corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName> fashioned in the summer evenings <pb n="269"
                        xml:id="VAB7385-273"/> —has been broken up for firewood; and in <persName corresp="#jcraven"
                        >Jack</persName>'s chair in the dining-room, the father of the family reposes his plethoric bulk
                    of an evening, when he does not happen to be getting drunk at the "Punch Bowl," and snores
                    euphoniously.</p>
                <p>And <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Bob</persName>, pursued by blessings, prayers, lamentations, and
                    strong wishes for his safe back-coming, is gone—gone away in a smoky steamer, over the mist-mantled
                    grey sea. Not a few of the tears that fell for him came from <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName>'s eyes—not love-tears, shed privily, secretly, dashed away with hasty care at
                    the sound of any approaching footsteps, but poured out openly, publicly, in the presence of his
                    mother and sisters—mingled with theirs, indeed, as of no different quality. Not more openly, not
                    more publicly, had she wept for old Luath, when, on the day before the sale, the old dog, who had
                    ailed and moped ever since his master's (to him) unaccountable disappearance, crawled weakly to her
                    feet, and, looking up dimly wistful into her face for the last time, died licking her tender hand.
                    On the day before his departure, <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Brandon</persName> came to say <said
                        who="#rbrandon">" Good-bye"</said> to her.</p>
                <p><said who="#rbrandon">" I have told mother <hi rend="i">nothing</hi>,"</said> he says, with some
                    embarrassment, in allusion to their late engagement—<said who="#rbrandon">" nothing, except that I
                        was sure that I could not make you happy. I have given her no reason, <persName
                            corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>—give her none either! She will not ask you point-blank,
                        and it is always easy to evade indirect questions; there are some things that it is of no use
                        being confidential about."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"I see,"</said> she answers, with a faint smile. <said who="#ecraven">"I
                        understand, neatly as you have gilded the pill, you are afraid that she would turn me
                        out-of-doors if she knew what a treacherous, black-hearted wretch I have been; that I should
                        have to take refuge even sooner than I must otherwise do in the workhouse, to which I always
                        look forward as my final destination."</said></p>


                <pb n="270" xml:id="VAB7385-274"/>

                <p>Then, bidding God bless her, he wrings her hand, strongly, and so takes his last farewell of her, nor
                    ever sees her fair face and great gentle stag eyes again.</p>
                <p>And now he is gone—gone with a difficult smile on his face, and very little money in his pocket. He
                    never has much, but he has less than usual now; having spent his few last sovereigns on the erecting
                    a plain white cross at the head of <persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName>'s low grave, that,
                    when this generation has passed, his place of sleeping may not be quite undistinguished from that of
                    his neighbour dust. He has gone, with his heart's strongest longing balked, his prime hope
                    death-smitten; but yet not despairing—not cursing his day, nor arraigning High God, saying, <said
                        who="#rbrandon">"Why do I, undeserving, thus suffer?"</said> He carries away with him no heavy
                    seething load of revenge, no man-slaying ardour of hatred against the woman that has wronged him,
                    and the man for whose sake she did it. Life is full, interesting, complex—not all on one string,
                    whatever morbid women and moody rhymers may say; not all sexual love—all of it, that is, that is not
                    devoted to drinking, as Anacreon, Catullus, and Moore have dulcetly told us. And therefore, though
                    poor, disappointed, and heart-wrung, <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Brandon</persName> is not all
                    unhappy. He has been greatly sinned against, and has forgiven, thus exercising the function that
                    raises us nearest to a level with the Godhead.</p>
                <p>And meanwhile <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>, left behind in wintry Wales, takes his
                    emptied place at <hi rend="i"><foreign xml:lang="fr">triste</foreign></hi> Plas Berwyn. Despite all
                    her resolves, despite her high talk that a morsel of <persName corresp="#mrsbrandon">Mrs.
                        Brandon</persName>'s bread would choke her—that it would be better to starve than to be under
                    any obligation to the family of the man she has betrayed—she is now eating that suffocating bread,
                    now lying under those annihilating obligations.</p>
                <p>Want makes us swallow our dignity—makes us do many mean things. One <hi rend="i">must</hi> live; one
                    must keep in that breath <pb n="271" xml:id="VAB7385-275"/> that perhaps is only spent in sighs: and
                    Mr. James Greenwood has made us all out of love with the workhouse. So she sits down three times a
                    day at <persName corresp="#mrsbrandon">Mrs. Brandon</persName>'s table, the unwillingest guest that
                    ever sat at any board, and eats the bread of charity, and the roast mutton and apple-tart of
                    charity, when the conclusion of the long Puritan grace gives her permission to do so.</p>
                <p>There is plenty of time for thinking at Plas Berwyn, for in that still household talk is not rife.
                    When people never leave their own little one earth-nook, rarely see any one beyond their immediate
                    family circle, and rarelier still read any reviews, papers, books, that treat of any subject but
                    one, they have not much to talk about. There are few minds original enough, copious enough, to
                    suffice to them- selves—to be able to do without supplies derived from external objects. Our
                    thoughts are generally our own, merely by right of immediate possession; mostly they are the
                    thoughts of others, more or less digested, more or less amalgamated with thought-matter of our
                    own.</p>
                <p>They are not unkind to her, these chill faded women. Not loving her—for, as <persName
                        corresp="#ebrandon">Bessy</persName> appositely quoted, <said who="#ebrandon"><quote>"Can two
                            walk together except they be agreed "</quote></said>—and <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName> and they are most surely in nothing agreed; mistrusting her, though not
                    knowing, of having dealt falsely by their brother; sincerely, though bigotedly, looking upon her
                    society as unprofitable—nay, almost contaminating; as being one of the unregenerate many—one
                    standing in the cold, outside their little clique of elect, safe souls: despite all this, they are
                    yet willing to give her food and shelter, to give them her for an indefinite number of years, to
                    make her a part of their own dry sapless lives.</p>
                <p>But she is not willing—oh, most unwilling! Let me not be mistaken, however: it is not with the
                    dryness and saplessness of the offered life that she quarrels. Life must <pb n="272"
                        xml:id="VAB7385-276"/> henceforth be to her, everywhere, dry and sapless; the duller it is, the
                    less it contrasts with her own thoughts. It must be lived somewhere: it can be lived pleasurably
                    nowhere. Then, why not unpleasurably, greyly, negatively, at Plas Berwyn? Why not, supposing that
                    she had been able to pay for her own cups of tea and slices of mutton, for her own iron bedstead and
                    deal washhand-stand?</p>
                <p>But, supposing that she was not able; supposing that she was so destitute as to be glad, even while
                    weeping over his poor rough body, that her old dog had died because she was too poor to be able to
                    keep him; supposing that this life entailed upon her the bitter pain of being daily, hourly grateful
                    to people for whose society she had a strong repugnance, and upon whom, in the person of one of
                    their nearest and dearest, she had inflicted a mortal injury? It is hard to live with people whose
                    every idea runs counter to your own—whose whole tone of thought and conversation is diametrically
                    opposed to what you have been used to all your life—and yet not be able to contradict, to argue
                    with, or differ from them, because you are eating of their bread and drinking of their cup. The mere
                    fact of feeling that you are too deeply indebted to people to be able, without flagrant ingratitude,
                    to quarrel, makes you desire ardently to fall out with them.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"How much better to be a professed beggar at once!"</said> thinks <persName
                        corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>, with a sort of grim humour. <said who="#ecraven">"How much
                        better to whine and shuffle along the streets at people's elbows, swearing that you have a
                        husband dying of consumption, and six children all under three years of age starving at
                        home!"</said></p>
                <p>It is only the very basest and the very noblest natures that can accept great favours and not be
                    crushed by them. Esther's is neither. To her it is only the thought that her state of dependence is
                    temporary that makes it supportable. <pb n="273" xml:id="VAB7385-277"/> She has lost no time in
                    appealing to <persName corresp="#mrsbrandon">Mrs. Brandon</persName> for her aid in the search for
                        work—<hi rend="i">work</hi>, that vague word, that conveys to her no distinct idea, that stands
                    to her in the place of something to be done by her, in return for which she may be able to obtain
                    food and drink, without saying <said who="#ecraven">"Thank you"</said> to any one for them.</p>
                <p>On the afternoon of the day of <persName corresp="#rbrandon">Bob</persName>'s departure <persName
                        corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> has been sitting for an hour or more, in listless sadness,
                    on the fender-stool before the fire, her eyes staring vacantly at the battered Michaelmas daisies
                    aqd discoloured chrysanthemums in the wintry, darkening garden outside. <persName
                        corresp="#mrsbrandon">Mrs. Brandon</persName>'s steel knitting-pins click gently, as she knits
                    round and round, round and round, in the monotonous eternity of a long-ribbed knickerbocker
                    stocking. The fire-gleams flicker dully red on the sombre, large-patterned flock-paper, which makes
                    the room look twice as small and twice as dark as it need otherwise do. <persName corresp="#ecraven"

                    of the day before her departure she stands in the churchyard ready to say it. It is only to a grave.
                    Huge cloud headlands, great leaden capes and promontories, mournful and heavy with unwept
                    snow-tears, heap and pile themselves up behind the dim mirk hills; it snowed last night, but the
                    snow has nearly all melted; only enough remains to make the old dirty church-tower, from which great
                    patches of whitewash have fallen, look dirtier than ever. Upon the broken headstones, all awry and
                    askew with age and negligence, the lichens flourish dankly. Wet nettles and faded bents overlie,
                    overcross each cold hillock. No one cares to weed in the garden of the dead. Each hillock is the
                    last chapter in some forgotten history.</p>
                <p>Oh! why must all stories that are told truly end amongst the worms? Why must death be always at the
                        <hi rend="i">end</hi> of life? Oh! if we could but get it over, like some cruelest operation, in
                    the middle or early part of our little day; so that we might have some half a life, some quarter or
                    twentieth part even of one, to live merrily in, to breathe and laugh and be gay in, without, in our
                    cheerfullest moments, experiencing the chilly fear of feeling the black-cloaked skeleton-headed

                <p>Upon the grey flat tombstone near the church-gate the great grave yew has been dropping her scarlet
                    berries, one by one—berries that shine, like little lights, amid the night of her changeless
                    foliage: there they lie like a forgotten rosary, that some holy man, having prayed amongst the
                    unpraying dead, going, has left behind him. Evening is closing in fast; the air is raw and chill; no
                    one that can avoid it is outside a house's sheltering walls : there is no one to disturb <persName

                    for the six feet of miry earth that part them. She flings herself upon the sodden mound; stretching
                    herself all along upon it, as the prophet stretched himself on the young dead child—hand to hand,
                    heart to heart, mouth to mouth. She lays her lips upon the soaked soil, and whispers moaningly,

                        Good-bye, my boy, good-bye!—God bless you, <persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName>!"</said>
                    gathers her dusky cloak about her slight shivering figure, and passes away through the darkness.</p>

                <head rend="center">CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
                <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> has snowed all day; an immense white monotony is over all the land. The clouds
                    that piled themselves in sulky threatening last night behind the Welsh hills, and many others like
                    them, have to-day fulfilled their threats, and have been, through all the daylight hours, emptying
                    their flaky load on the patient earth. It is as if a huge white bird had been shaking his pinions
                    somewhere, high up in the air—shaking down millions of little down feathers. Rain always seems in
                    earnest, snow in play—with such delicate leisureliness does it saunter down. The rushing train, <pb
                        n="293" xml:id="VAB7385-297"/> that bears <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> to her
                    new distant life, is topped like any twelfth-night cake; so are the wayside stations; so are the
                    houses in the smoky towns; so are the men, sparsely walking about on the country roads; so are the
                    engine drivers and stokers; so are the sheep in the fields.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName> has been sitting all day long in the narrow <hi
                        rend="i"><foreign xml:lang="fr">enceinte</foreign></hi> of a railway carriage, between the two
                    close-shut, snow-blinded windows—sitting opposite a courteous warrior, who, travelling with all the
                    luxuriousness which his sex think indispensable, is magnanimous enough to share his buffalo-robe and
                    foot-warmer with her. A <hi rend="i"><foreign xml:lang="fr">téte-à-téte</foreign></hi> of so many
                    consecutive hours with a man would, under any other circumstances than a railway journey, have
                    produced an intimacy that would last a life-time; but now, all the result of it is a couple of bows
                    on the platform at Paddington—a look of interested curiosity after his late companion's retreating
                    figure, as she hurries herself and her small properties into a filthy four-wheeler, on the part of
                    the warrior, and total oblivion on the part of <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>. Since
                    that time she has traversed London in her dilapidated shambling <hi rend="i">growler</hi>, she has
                    had awful misgiving that the <distinct>"cabby,"</distinct> with the villany that all women ascribe
                    to all <distinct>"cabbies,"</distinct> is purposely taking her in a wrong direction—is bearing her
                    away to some dark, policeless slum, there to be robbed and murdered. She has reflected, with cold
                    shivers of terror, as to what would be the wisest course to pursue, supposing such to be the case.
                    Should she look silently out of window till she caught sight of the friendly helmet and tight
                    frock-coat of some delivering <distinct>"Bobby,"</distinct> and then scream? Should she open the
                    door and jump out on the snowy pavement?</p>
                <p>While still undecided, her cab stops, and—all mean back-streets and sorry short-cuts being safely
                    passed-deposits her and her box, bag, and umbrella, beneath the Shoreditch lamps and among the
                    Shoreditch porters. Then an hour's <pb n="294" xml:id="VAB7385-298"/> waiting in the crowded general
                    waiting-room, where all the chairs are occupied by fat men, none of whom make a movement towards
                    vacating theirs in favour of the slender weary woman, who, with crape veil thrown back from her sad
                    child-face, is holding her little numb hands over the fire, trying vainly to bring them back to
                    life. Then more train; then a three-miles' drive in a fly, up hill and down dale, along snowy
                    country lanes.</p>
                <p>And now her journey is ended: the fly has stopped at the door of a great, vague, snow-whitened bulk,
                    that she takes upon trust as Blessington Court. The driver, having rung the bell, now stands banging
                    his arms, each one against the opposite shoulder, in the rough endeavour to restore circulation. The
                    servants are too comfortable—the butler over his mulled port in the housekeeper's room, and the
                    footmen over their mulled beer in the servants' hall—to be in any hurry to attend to the summons. At
                    length, after five minutes' waiting, a sound of withdrawing bolts and turning keys makes itself
                    heard; the heavy door swings inward, and a footman appears in the aperture, blinking disgustedly at
                    the snow, which drives full into his eyes. <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>
                    immediately descends, and enters with the abrupt haste characteristic of extreme nervousness.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Will you pay him, please?"</said> she says, with a certain flurry of manner, to
                    the servant. <said who="#ecraven">"I—I don't know how much I ought to give him—how many miles it
                        is."</said></p>
                <p>While the man complies with her request, she stands in the huge stone-floored hall, lit only by
                    firelight, shivering with cold and fear. She peers up at the ceiling—of which, by-the-bye, there is
                    none, as the hall runs up to the top of the house; at the walls, from which great life-size figures,
                    dimly naked, glimmer uncomfortably cold. Anxious doubts assail her as to whether there are any rules
                    of which she is ignorant for a "companion's" behaviour and deportment; <pb n="295"
                        xml:id="VAB7385-299"/> she is not aware that she has ever seen one of those curious animals
                    hitherto in the course of her life. Ought they to make a reverence on entering a room? Ought they to
                    say "Sir" or "Ma'am" to whoever they address? Ought they to laugh at everybody's jokes?—not sit down
                    unless given leave so to do, and not speak unless spoken to? So wondering, she tremblingly follows
                    the footman as he opens the door of an adjoining apartment, and, announcing <said>"<persName
                            corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName>,"</said> retires joyfully to the society of his
                    compeers and his beer.</p>
                <p>The apartment in which <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> is thus left stranded is as
                    large as the hall that she has just quitted. It seems to her oppressively immense—quite a long walk
                    from the door to the inhabited portion. A very big roasting fire burns on the hearth: and right in
                    front of it, in the very glare of its hot red eyes, sits a very old man, doubled together in an
                    armchair—one hand in his breast, and his aged head sunk upon it, apparently fast asleep. An old
                    lady, wrapped up in a shawl, reposes in another easy-chair, with her eyes likewise closed. A lamp
                    with a green shade burns faintly on a centre table, and beyond lamp and table sits a third person,
                    hidden by the lamp-shade from <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s eyes.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Are they all asleep?"</said> thinks the poor girl, advancing with gentle,
                    hesitating steps. <said who="#ecraven">"They seem to be. How can I wake them?—or would it be
                        disrespectful?"</said></p>
                <p>While she so speculates, the third person rises and comes forward. <said who="#cblessington">"How do
                        you do, <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName>? You must have had a cold journey,
                        I'm afraid?"</said> says a bland, unforgotten voice.</p>
                <p>It is <persName corresp="#cblessington">Miss Blessington</persName>. In an instant, <persName
                        corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> seems to have jumped back over the past intervening
                    months—to be just entering on her Felton visit. There is the same voice greeting her—the same tones
                    of polite inquiry; the same words almost, except that <hi rend="i">then</hi> it was, <said
                        who="#cblessington">"How do you do, <pb n="296" xml:id="VAB7385-300"/>
                        <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName>! You must have had a hot journey, I'm
                        afraid?"</said> and now it is, <said who="#cblessington">"How do you do, <persName
                            corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName>? You must have had a cold journey, I'm afraid?"
                    </said>—the same undulating walk; the same effect of lilac evening clouds. Involuntarily she turns
                    her head and glances towards the window, half-expecting to see <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St.
                        John</persName>'s legs disappearing through it. Instead, an old woman's voice sounds quavering:
                        <said who="#hblessington">"Are you <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName>, my dear?
                        Come here!" </said></p>
                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> does not hear. <said who="#ecraven">"It <hi rend="i"
                            >was</hi> rather cold,"</said> she says, answering <persName corresp="#cblessington"
                        >Constance</persName>, in half bewilderment between past and present, her eyes dazed with the
                    light after her long, dark journey.</p>
                <p><said who="#cblessington">"<persName corresp="#hblessington">Mrs. Blessington</persName> is speaking
                        to you,"</said> says <persName corresp="#cblessington">Constance</persName>, in mild
                    reminder.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> turns round quickly. <said who="#ecraven">"Oh! I beg
                        your pardon—I did not hear—I hope I was not rude,"</said> she cries, forgetting the "Ma'am" she
                    had half-purposed employing.</p>
                <p><said who="#jblessington">"Who's there?—who's talking?"</said> asks the old man, lifting up his head,
                    and speaking in a voice tremulous indeed, but with a remnant of the power and fire that "youth gone
                    out had left in ashes."</p>
                <p>No one answers.</p>
                <p><said who="#jblessington">"Who's there, <persName corresp="#hblessington">Mrs.
                        Blessington</persName>?"</said> he repeats, with querulous anger.</p>
                <p><said who="#cblessington">"<persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName>, uncle—the young lady
                        that we expected to-day—don't you know?"</said> replies <persName corresp="#cblessington"
                        >Constance</persName>, stooping gracefully over him, and putting her lips as close as possible
                    to his withered ear.</p>
                <p><said who="#jblessington">"H'm! Tell her to come and speak to me. I want to see what she is
                        like,"</said> he rejoins, much as if she had not been in the room.</p>
                <p><said who="#hblessington">"Go to him, my dear,"</said> says the old lady.</p>
                <p><said who="#cblessington">"And speak as loud as you can; he is as deaf as a post,"</said> adds
                        <persName corresp="#cblessington">Constance</persName>, not in the least lowering her voice at
                    the <pb n="297" xml:id="VAB7385-301"/> announcement, in perfect confidence of the truth of her
                    assertion, shrugging her handsome shoulders as she speaks.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> goes trembling, and lays her small cold hand in the
                    long bony wreck of muscle, vein, and flesh that is stretched out to her. He gazes at her face with
                    the eager intentness of the purblind.</p>
                <p><said who="#jblessington">"What is your name?"</said> he asks abruptly.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"<persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>,"</said> she answers,
                    faltering.</p>
                <p><said who="#jblessington">"Cannot hear a word you say—you mumble so,"</said> he says, pettishly.</p>
                <p><said who="#cblessington">"Go round to the other side; the other ear is the best,"</said> suggests
                        <persName corresp="#cblessington">Constance</persName>, calmly.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> obeys. <said who="#ecraven">"<hi rend="i"><persName

                    loud this time—at the top of her voice, in fact, out of sheer nervousness.</p>
                <p><said who="#jblessington">"You need not scream at me, my dear, as if I were stone deaf. <hi rend="i"

                    senile laugh, <said who="#jblessington">"that I think they might have found a prettier name to give
                        a young lady, and that the old squire says so. The old squire says so,"</said> he repeats,
                    chuckling a little to himself.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"I cannot tell them,"</said> answers <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName>, half-crying. <said who="#ecraven">"They are dead."</said></p>

                <p>There his interest in the new comer seems to cease. His white head sinks back on his breast again,
                    and he relapses into slumber.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> has had neither luncheon, dinner, nor tea—a fact which

                    room—frosty, yet cold, despite the fire burning briskly on the old- fashioned-hobbed grate; a vast
                    dark four-poster, hung with ginger-coloured moreen; a couch that looks highly suitable for
                    lying-in-state on; an old-fashioned screen, covered with caricatures of Fox, Burke, the Regent, and
                    Queen Caroline; and on the walls a highly valuable and curious tapestry, which waves pleasantly in
                    the bitter wind that enters freely beneath the ill-fitting old door, giving an air of galvanic
                    motion and false life to the ill-looking Cupids, green with age, that play hide-and-seek amongst

                <p>I <hi rend="sc">THINK</hi> that people's value, or want of value, is seldom their own: it belongs
                    rather to the circumstances that surround them—to attributes foreign to themselves—outside of them.
                    Had Robinson Crusoe, while walking down Bond Street in flowing wig and lace ruffles, first met his
                    man Friday, he might have tossed him sixpence to avoid his importunities; but would hardly have
                    taken him into intimate friendship—would hardly even have admitted him <pb n="300"
                        xml:id="VAB7385-304"/> as a man and a brother. Among the blind the one-eyed is king, and among a
                    crowd of total strangers an acquaintance rises into a friend.</p>
                <p>Lonely <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> is half-inclined to effect this metamorphosis
                    in the case of <persName corresp="#cblessington">Miss Blessington</persName>. The mere fact of
                    having eaten, drank, and slept for a considerable period under the same roof with her—the bare fact
                    of having lived with and disliked her during a whole month and more—was enough recommendation in a
                    house not one of whose inmates had she ever beheld before. Almost as a friend has she greeted her
                    this morning. With admiration most unfeigned, though made a little bitter by mental comparison with
                    her own dimmed, grief-blighted beauty, has she regarded the stately woman, the splendid animal,
                    sleek and white as a sacred Egyptian cow; the brilliancy of whose pale, bright hair, and the perfect
                    smoothness of her great satin throat, are heightened by the sober richness of her creaseless black
                    velvet dress. Voluptuous, yet cold, the passions that her splendid physique provoke are chilled to
                    death by the passionless stupor of her soul. I am not at all sure that impassioned ugliness—
                    supposing the ugliness to be moderate, and the passion immoderate—has not more attraction for the
                    generality of men than iced beauty.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s warmth is thrown away; she might as well expect that
                    the "Venus de Medici" would return the pressure of warm clinging fingers with her freezing,
                    sculptured hand. <said who="#ecraven">"I was so glad to find you here last night: it was so pleasant
                        to see a face one knew,"</said>
                    <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName> says, with the rash credulity of youth
                    unexpectant of snubs.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#cblessington">Miss Blessington</persName> looks slightly surprised. <said
                        who="#cblessington">"Tha—anks; it is very good of you to say so, I am sure,"</said> she answers,
                    rather drawlingly, and with a small, cold smile that would repress demonstrations much more violent
                    than any that <pb n="301" xml:id="VAB7385-305"/>
                    <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> had meditated. It is difficult <hi rend="i"
                        >always</hi> to remember that one is a "companion"</p>
                <p>The Blessington dining-room is, like the other reception-rooms, huge and very nobly proportioned. Did
                    we not know that our seventeenth and eighteenth century ancestors were not giants, we should be
                    prone to imagine that it must have been a race of Anakims that required such great wide spaces to
                    sup, and sip chocolate, and play at omnbre in. The furniture is in its dotage; it has, figuratively
                    speaking, like its owners, lost hair and teeth, and all unnecessary etceteras; it is reduced to the
                    bare elements of existence. Three tall windows look out upon a flat lawn, and in the middle of this
                    lawn, exactly opposite Esther's eyes, as she sits at breakfast, is an unique and chaste piece of
                    statuary, entitled "The Rape of the Sabines." The space afforded by the stone pediment is
                    necessarily limited, and consequently Roman and Sabines, gentlemen and lady, are all piled one a-top
                    of another in such inextricable confusion as to demand a good quarter of an hour's close observation
                    to determine which of the muscular writhing legs belong to the Roman ravisher and which to the
                    injured Sabine husband. As the sculptor has given none of his <hi rend="i"><foreign xml:lang="fr"
                            >protégées</foreign></hi> any clothing, the snow has been kind enough to throw a modest

                        >Esther</persName>, who has a vague idea that the Bible is the only form in which literature

                <p><said who="#cblessington">"The Bible? Oh, dear, no!" </said> (with a little laugh). <said

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"I daresay it won't affect mine,"</said> rejoins the other rather drily.</p>
                <p>There is a pause. Talking is a vice to which <persName corresp="#cblessington">Miss

                <p><persName corresp="#cblessington">Miss Blessington</persName> does not usually employ emphasis: it is

                <p>Half an hour later <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> is sitting beside the old squire,

                    unaccustomed hand. The old squire is a superb wreck. Spiteful Time is fond of removing the landmarks
                    that youth sets upon our faces; is fond of changing great, clear, almond eyes into little damp
                    jellies—sweet moist pursemouths into dry bags of wrinkles; but it is a task beyond even <hi rend="i"

                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> has not the most distant idea where the "State of the

                    their habitat, making, meanwhile, the most unjustifiable aggressive rustling and crackling, which
                    she presumptuously trusts to his deafness not to hear.</p>
                <p><said who="#jblessington">"Don't make such an infernal crackling, my dear!"</said> he says presently,

                <p>Not feeling any particular personal interest in the effect of Secession upon American politics, she

                    sits down humbly with her back to the horses—a process which usually ends in making her sick. The
                    windows are shut tight up; a great hot skin of some wild beast is thrown over their knees; in that
                    confined atmosphere it emits a strong furry odour, more powerful than agreeable; striving emulously
                    with it—sometimes mastering it, sometimes mastered by it—is the fusty smell of the cloth lining. The
                    old people do not seem to perceive either; old noses haie less keen scent, old lungs require less
                    air to feed on, than young ones.</p>

                    ticked away by the château clocks. There is only one small lamp in the whole of the grand old room,
                    and that, in deference to the old man's failing eyes, is hung with so large and deep a green shade,
                    that it is impossible to see to do anything by its light. There is nothing for it but to gape, from
                    seven till ten, at the great battle-pieces hung round the walls—to endeavour to make out, by the aid
                    of the fitful firelight, the singularly clean dead bodies, free apparently from the slightest speck
                    of dust, or stain of blood; at the red-nostriled chargers, snorting away their ebbing lives with all

                <p>T<hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> first day is a sample of <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s new
                    life; the other days were like it—not a jot better, not a jot worse. The same thing happened at the
                    same time each day: no two things ever changed places. It was a life that provided all the
                    necessaries of life—that demanded no hard manual labour, no overworking of the brain. The
                    intellectual faculties that it called into play must have been possessed by any moderately
                    intelligent seven-years' child. No one bullies <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>; no
                    one oppresses her; no one troubles their head much about her. So as she performs her monotonous,
                    easy, tiresome little duties towards them, the old people have no sort of objection to her enjoying
                    life, <hi rend="i">if she can</hi>. With the aged, comfort and happiness are interchangeable terms:
                    continuous warmth of body, pleasant-tasted meats, a profound stagnant quiet around their arm-chairs,
                    much sleep—these are their <hi rend="i"><foreign xml:lang="lat">summum bonum</foreign></hi>. They
                    have had love, and have outlived it—excitement also, and grief: they have outlived all but the
                    elemental instincts that refuse to be outlived. Looking back from the vantage-ground of dotage on
                    the fought battle of life, they wonder that any one can long to be in the thick of it. In this life
                    of <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s there are no hardships to be borne—none of those
                    sufferings, the enduring of which with self-conscious complacent heroism almost compensates them. It
                    has none of the elements of tragedy: there is nothing very noble in bearing with respectable
                    patience the trifling annoyance of making yourself hoarse roaring the price of wheat, and the pros
                    and cons of disendowment, into an old man's ear; there is nothing <pb n="309" xml:id="VAB7385-313"/>
                    grand in picking up the countless dropped stitches in an old woman's knitting. In it there is
                    nothing to endure, nothing to enjoy; it is essentially negative, flat, stale, sterile. It would be
                    all very well if any end were to be seen to it; if it were not a sort of small Eternity in life; if
                    there were to be distant holidays to be looked forward to, when the few saved pounds might be
                    poured, with the joyful generosity of the very poor, into some stricken parent's lap— might go to
                    buy boots and shoes for needy little brothers and sisters. But <quote><l rend="ti-3">"Fatherly,

                    running; of lending all her useful organs of sight and hearing and touch to others; of keeping for
                    herself only her suffering, aching, empty heart! <quote><l rend="center">"Every succeeding year will

                <p>The snow lies long—longer than it generally does at this time of year. Ordinarily the old Cheshire

                    white heap here, and a white depression there, show where bush or bed were wont to be. Over the fair
                    wide park, with all its mimic hills and valleys, copses and spinneys, God has laid a great sheet—
                    great as the one that was let down by its four corners on the housetop to the fastidious Apostle—a
                    sheet purely, crisply, miserably white. In the park <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>,

                    most; traces the slender footprints of the famished birds—the little delicate tracks crossing and
                    recrossing one another. And always the leading thought—displaced now and then by lesser thoughts,

                        xml:id="VAB7385-315"/> with strains of welcoming music in their ears: he had departed painfully,

                    rat-haunted, ghostly <pb n="312" xml:id="VAB7385-316"/> old chamber. She dreads falling asleep, for
                    fear of waking to find the low fire playing antics with Burke's long nose and spectacles, with
                    Pitt's maypole figure on the screen; flickering over the malignant fleshy Cupids on the wall; waking
                    to see, looking in upon her through the curtains, <persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName>'s
                    face—not kind, <hi rend="i"><foreign xml:lang="fr">débonnaire</foreign></hi>, smiling, as she used
                    to see it in the study at home (for <hi rend="i">that</hi> could frighten no one), but solemn,
                    stiff, with closed eyes and bandaged chin, as she had last seen it. Sometimes she sits up in bed, a
                    cold sweat standing on her brow, as some noise, distincter than usual, sounds through the room;
                        <sound>"thud, thud,"</sound> as of some falling object; an unexplained rustling in the passage;
                    a little clicking in the door-lock—sits up, listening with strained ears, thinking, <said

                    crape-masked burglar enter the door or window. And if such burglar did enter, it would be useless to
                    scream for help; she is too far off from the rest of the household to be heard: it would be of no
                    use to ring the bell, for it rings downstairs, miles away, and everybody is in bed and asleep
                    upstairs. So she lies quaking—her terror now and then rising to such an uncontrollable pitch that
                    she feels as though, if it lasted a moment longer, she must go mad: listening with intense
                    impatience to the leisurely <sound>"Tick-tack, tick-tack, tick-tack"</sound> of the cuckoo- clock
                    outside; listening with inexpressible longing to hear it say, <sound>" Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo,
                        cuckoo !"</sound> four times. At four o'clock she will be safe, she thinks; at four o'clock
                    cocks begin to crow, dairymaids to get up, the bodiless dead return to their churchyard homes,
                    night's unutterable horror to pass. What wonder if, after the agony of such vigils—agony causeless,
                    you will say, unreasonable, but none the less real, none the less acute for that—she comes down in
                    the morning wan, nerveless, with haggard cheeks, and great dark streaks under the unrested beauty of

                    that it is a great room—else the fire, piled halfway up the chimney, and the never-opened windows
                    would render it unendurably close. As it is, the atmosphere, though less stifling than that of the
                    interior of the family-coach, is fustier than is altogether agreeable.</p>
                <p><said who="#hblessington">"My dear,"</said> says <persName corresp="#hblessington">Mrs.

                        have sand-bags to those windows; there comes in a wind at them that positively nearly blows one

                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> complies, and then resumes her occupation of holding a
                    skein of wool for <persName corresp="#cblessington">Miss Blessington</persName> to wind. As often as
                    she can do so without positive rudeness, she takes long looks at her companion's face—immovably
                    polished, like a monumental angel's: looks at her, half out of that sheer love of beauty in any
                    form, from a man's to a beetle's, <pb n="314" xml:id="VAB7385-318"/> which is innate in some
                    sensuous natures; partly, and much more, because each frosty-fair feature of her face, each trinket
                    almost upon her person, is linked indissolubly in her mind with some look or word of <persName
                        corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName>. Association, they say, lies stronger in a smell than in
                    aught else—stronger than in anything seen or heard ; and so now the slight subtle scent floating
                    from <persName corresp="#cblessington">Constance</persName>'s perfumed hair recalls to the sad young
                    "companion," with a thrust of sharpest pain, her one day's betrothal; that one day for whose sweet
                    sake she does not regret having endured the calamity of existence; that day when they sowed—

                <p>The knife cuts as clean and clear as she could have wished; the divine happy rose-flush slips away

                    humming buzz sounds dully in her ears; then the faintness passes; the table and chairs stand still
                    again; the buzz ceases; and she is sitting on an old gilt chair: her arms still moving mechanically,
                    with the outstretched wool upon them, while <persName corresp="#cblessington">Constance</persName>
                    goes winding, winding on—winding away hope and pleasure and joy; while the ball, growing larger
                    under her hands, seems to have stolen its red colour from <persName corresp="#ecraven"

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Oh no, no! they make the corners of the room blacker than ever, and they cast
                        such odd shadows. I'm so afraid of the dark,"</said> she ends, shuddering.</p>

                <p><said>"I've got a little laudanum, ma'am, that Mrs. Franklin give me last week when I had a bad

                        <said who="#blessmaid">"but I cannot sleep for fright."</said></p>
                <p>The servant goes, and presently returns with a small dark blue bottle.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"About how much ought one to take, I wonder?"</said>
                    <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> says, holding it up between herself and the

                <p><said who="#blessmaid">"If you have never been used to take it before, I should think two or three

                        chemist's young man—and in an hour she was a corpse; they said as she had took enough to kill
                        ten men."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"It is no wonder that she was a corpse, then,"</said>
                    <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName> answers, with a slight smile. <said
                        who="#ecraven">"I should not think"</said> (scrutinising the little bottle inquisitively), <said
                        who="#ecraven">"that there was enough here to kill one woman, let alone ten men. Yes, I'll be
                        careful; thanks, very much. Good night!"</said> (with her pretty courteous smile).</p>
                <p>The housemaid being gone, <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> bolts the door—a weakly
                    defensive measure against one class of assailants, the crape-masked burglars; though, as she is
                    aware, utterly <pb n="321" xml:id="VAB7385-325"/> impotent against the other and worse class—the
                    intangible, unkeep-outable <hi rend="i">revenants</hi>; the rustlers along the passage, the rattlers
                    of the lock. She then seats herself at the dressing-table, flings down her arms among her brushes
                    and combs, and sinks her head upon them, in closest proximity to the candles, whose little spires of
                    flame the wind, thrusting its thin body in between window and frame, drives right against the
                    tumbled plenty of her hair. In this attitude she remains a long time; forgetting even to search
                    under the bed, up the chimney, behind the screen, or in the huge japanned chest, upon which a
                    disconnected but interesting landscape of cocks, pagodas, and junks picks itself out, in tarnished
                    yellow, from the dull black ground.</p>
                <p>It is impossible for the most comprehensive mind or body to contain any two distinct, even though not
                    necessarily opposite feelings, in their fullest force, at the same time. If one is famished with
                    hunger, one cannot be consumed by thirst; if one is consumed by thirst, one cannot be famished with
                    hunger. If one is in despair at being forgotten by one's lover, one is indifferent as to the onset
                    of any number of ghosts and murderers; if one is paralyzed by fear of ghosts and murderers, one is
                    tolerably indifferent as to one's lover's lapse of memory. For the first time since his death,
                        <persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName> is not the leading thought in <persName
                        corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s mind. Poor dead! How can they be so unreasonable as to
                    expect to be anyone's leading thought? Even we noisy, voiceful, visible living are obliged to keep
                    crying out, <said>"I am here—remember me,"</said> in order not to sink into oblivion amongst our
                    neighbours and kinsfolk. <quote><l rend="ti-3">"Wilt thou remember me when I am gone,</l>

                    <said>"I will remember thee for a very little while; even till I see some one younger and prettier
                        than thou wert, and then I will forget thee!"</said></p>
                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName> starts up, after awhile, and begins to walk up
                    and down, over the creaky, up-and-downy boards, and to speak vehemently and out loud to the rats,
                    who, numerous and cheerful as usual, are scrabbling, pattering, squeaking under the floor, behind
                    the wainscot, in the japan-chest. <said who="#ecraven">"At all events,"</said> she says, with a sort
                    of savage satisfaction, <said who="#ecraven">"there is one comfort: he'll be miserable—he'll curse
                        the day when he ties himself to that lump of <foreign xml:lang="fr">blancmange</foreign>.
                            <foreign xml:lang="fr">Blancmange</foreign>! white meat! that exactly expresses her; she
                        looks as if she would be good to eat—soft, luscious, ripe. Unfortunately, a man does not
                        contemplate <hi rend="i">eating</hi> his wife!"</said></p>
                <p>But even this little angry gleam of comfort has but a short life. Soon, too soon, it occurs to her
                    that men do not look at a woman with women's eyes. Men, being three parts animal themselves, condone
                    any offence to a woman the animal part of whom is perfect and beautiful. How else is it that
                    beauty—mere blank beauty, although destitute of any accessory charms—can always command its price in
                    the market, and that price a high one? In marrying <persName corresp="#cblessington"
                        >Constance</persName>, <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName> will have no
                    disappointments to undergo, no discoveries to make. He has known her all her life; has seen her
                    change from a handsome stupid child into a handsomer stupider girl, and bloom, lastly, into a
                    handsomest, stupidest woman. <persName corresp="#cblessington">Constance</persName> has no
                    antecedents; she is a woman without a history. That also is in her favour. A man likes to write his
                    name on a sheet of white paper better than on one upon which many other men have written theirs.
                    Perfectly virtuous, perfectly healthy, perfectly beautiful, young, rich, not ill-tempered, not fast,
                    not shrew-tongued—surely she is a prize worth any man's <pb n="323" xml:id="VAB7385-327"/> drawing.
                    If, in addition to her long list of qualifications, she possessed also Desdemona's heart and
                    Imogen's mind, it would be too hard upon the rest of womankind : <quote><l rend="ti-3">" Why should
                            one woman have all goodly things?"</l></quote></p>
                <p>Want of sympathy with the companion of her life makes a woman embittered, reckless—sends her often
                    trespassing on her neighbours' preserves, in the endeavour to find there that congeniality of spirit
                    which is not to be met with in her own. Want of sympathy with the companion of <hi rend="i">his</hi>
                    life sends a man oftener to his club; makes him much pleasanter to other women when he goes into
                    society; makes him sulky and sleepy when he dines at home—that is all. Doubtless <persName
                        corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName> will be indifferent to his bride at first; he will
                    dislocate his jaw with yawning during their wedding-tour, but she will bear him children; <foreign
                        xml:lang="fr">" selon les us et coutumes Anglaises, elle aura beaucoup d'enfants;" </foreign> he
                    will like her for that. Year by year they will come here to Blessington, probably. Year by year she
                        (<persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>) will see the blossom of a fuller contentment on
                    his wide brow, the quiet of a deeper rest in his restless eyes. And she herself will be here always,
                    for one cannot throw away one's daily bread. Year by year they will find her with ever thinner hair,
                    sharper shoulders, drabber cheeks; and he, looking upon her with the forgiveness of complete
                    indifference, will say to himself, <said who="#sjgerard">"She is bad, and she is ugly; I was well
                        rid of her!" </said> Than to be so forgiven, how much rather would she have been struck down
                    dead by his hand, lifted in righteous anger and vengeance, on that moonlit September night, beside
                    the glassy rush-brimmed mere at Felton! A sudden rage at her own fatuity fills her, when she looks
                    back on that idiotic hope that had upsprung in her mind, that his object in coming to Blessington
                    was to pardon her, <pb n="324" xml:id="VAB7385-328"/> and take her back to himself. Do men ever

                <p>She sits down before her looking-glass, and stares desperately, with inner eyes, at the blank ruin of
                    her life; with outer eyes at the ruin mirrored in her sunken, altered face, that the old
                    looking-glass, blurred with rust stains, makes look more sunken and altered still. Involuntarily she
                    lifts her thumb and forefinger, and lays them in the hollows of her cheek, as if seeking for the red
                    carnations that used to flower so fairly there. She has noticed before the decay of her
                    beauty—noticed it with apathy, as who should say, <said who="#ecraven">"Everything else is gone, why
                        should not this go too?"</said> But now she observes it with a sick pang, as at the parting with
                    a friend; she would give ten years of her life to reach it back again. <said who="#ecraven">"It was
                        only for my beauty he liked me,"</said> she says, still speaking aloud; <said who="#ecraven">"it
                        was only for my beauty that anybody could like me ; there is nothing else to like in me. I never
                        was clever, or said witty things, or sang, or played: I was only pretty. Now that that is gone,
                        everything is gone!" </said></p>
                <p>As one shipwrecked, floating about on a plank among the weltering waves of some great plunging,
                    grey-green sea, <pb n="325" xml:id="VAB7385-329"/> strains his eyes along the horizon to see some
                    sail-speck, some misty palm-island, that looks as though it were hung midway in air; so she strains
                    her mental eyes to catch sight of some friendly ship that may take her off from this rock of her
                    despair. This world is full, of pairs, but some oversight has left a good many odd ones also;
                        <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> is an odd one. Her road has come to a blank wall,
                    and there stopped. Is there no ladder that can overclimb this wall?—no gap in all the thickness of
                    its brick-and-mortar?—no outlet ?</p>
                <p>She rises and stands by the fire; her eyes down-dropped on the blue-and-white Dutch tiles—on the
                    hobs, and queer brass-inlaid dogs: involuntarily she raises them, and they rest upon the little
                    laudanum-bottle on the chimneypiece. Quick as lightning, an answer to her thought-question seems
                    flashed across her mind. There is a ladder that can over-climb <hi rend="i">any</hi> wall; there is
                    a gap that can give egress through the stoutest masonries; there is an outlet from the deepest
                    dungeon; and this ladder, this gap, this outlet, men call <hi rend="i">Death</hi>. Over the sea of
                    her memory the housemaid's words float back: <said who="#blessmaid">"I hope you'll be careful not to
                        take an overdose, 'm, or you might chance never to wake again!"</said> They had been spoken in
                    careful warning; to her they seemed words of persuasive promise. Never to wake again! Never to say
                    again in the evening, <said who="#ecraven">" Would God it were morning!"</said> and in the morning,
                        <said who="#ecraven">"Would God it were evening!"</said></p>
                <p>To <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>, the great sting of death had always laid in his
                    pain—in his gasping breath, twitched features, writhen unfleshed limbs; but this death that comes in
                    sleep can be no bitterer than a mother that lifts her little slumbering child out of his small bed
                    (he not knowing), and bears him away softly. The idea of self-slaughter, when first suggested, has
                    always something terrific, especially to us, who from <pb n="326" xml:id="VAB7385-330"/> our birth
                    have been taught to look upon it as a crime hardly second to murder; to us, to whom Cato's great
                    heroism and Lucretia's chaste martyrdom seem as sins. Some vague idea that suicide is forbidden in
                    the Scriptures runs through <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s mind. She sits down at
                    the table, and, drawing a Bible towards her, searches long among the partial, temporary, and local
                    prohibitions and commands of the Books of the Law, and still longer among the universal,
                    all-applying prohibitions and commands of Gospel and Epistle. Whether it be that she search ill, or
                    that there is nought therein written on the subject she seeks, she knows not; only she finds
                    nothing; and, closing the book, she leans her pale cheek on her closed white hand. Her brain feels
                    strangely calm, and she even forgets the darkness of the night, musing on a deeper darkness.</p>
                <p>What is this death, that we write in such great black letters? After all, what is it that we know
                    about him, for or against? Is it fair to condemn him unheard, unknown? Why should we give him any
                    embodiment?—why should we personify him at all? He is but an ending: what is there in the end of
                    anything more terrifying than in its beginning, or its middle? Death is but the end of life, as
                    birth is its beginning, and as some unnoticed moment in its course is its middle.</p>
                <p>Why are the waters in which we set our feet at the last more coldly awful than those out of which we

                    ever round Time's little island? A clock is wound up for a certain number of hours; when that number
                    of hours has elapsed, it stops. Our more complicated machinery is wound up to go for a certain
                    number of years, months, days; when that number of years, months, and days is elapsed, we stop—that

                    and none blame him. A prisoner that is not on parole, what shall hinder him from escaping? If he can

                    two that would fain be together? What if, before her time, she incur the abasement of death, the
                    dishonour of corruption, and yet attain not the object for whose sake she is willing desperately to

                    winds, and his eyelids purple with want of sleep, as he has been travelling night and day—not from
                    any violent hurry to reach his destination, but because boats and mail-trains suited—from the South
                    of Ireland, where for the last ten days he has been daily shooting the wily woodcock, and nightly
                    putting into practice the excellent resolution expressed in the song of <quote>"not going home till

                    their cigars, and reduce the number of their brandies and sodas. Neither a good-looking nor a
                    good-tempered young man does he look as he makes his descent. The first he cannot help—the second he
                    can. His ill-humour is owing partly to a violent headache; partly to the information, just imparted
                    to him by the butler, that <said>"the family dines at six o'clock now <hi rend="i">reg'lar</hi>—no

                    bored annoyance would certainly have given way to a stronger one, whether of pleasure or pain.
                    Crouched on one of the paintless window-seats in the China gallery, she watches his coming, as she
                    had watched his going; only that <pb n="331" xml:id="VAB7385-335"/> now she makes no smallest effort
                    to attract his attention—cowers away rather in the dark, while he stands, unconscious and grumbling,
                    in the patch of red light that comes through the open hall-door. He has been here half an hour
                    now—half an hour spent in the hot airtight saloon, where the giant fire draws a strong woolly smell
                    from <persName corresp="#cblessington">Miss Blessington</persName>'s winter dress, as she sits right
                    into the fire—a practice not permitted by the autocrat of Felton, and consequently largely indulged
                    in by his subjects when away from his master-eye.</p>

                    him the exact manner in which the draught comes through the middle window, and catches her just at
                    the back of the neck, so that when she wakes in the morning it is so stiff that she can hardly turn

                    to embrace her, blue and gold and white miracle though she be. Hearing her he turns, and the

                <p>Meanwhile, for the first time since her brother's death, the "companion"—the nice, quiet, young
                    ladylike person, <pb n="336" xml:id="VAB7385-340"/> whose only fault is being over-sensitive—is,
                    like <persName corresp="#cblessington">Constance</persName>, making a toilette. Since <persName
                        corresp="#sjgerard">Jack</persName>'s death she has daily put on her clothes, as a necessary
                    preliminary to the day's work; but it has been a task full of weariness—devoid of pleasure.
                    To-night, like <persName corresp="#cblessington">Constance</persName>, she makes a toilette, and
                    like <persName corresp="#cblessington">Constance</persName>, it is for the benefit of the young man

                    however, with any faintest hope that her Sunday frock, any more than her work-a-day one, will bring
                    back her lost lover to her side, that she puts the former on. The very strength of her faith in his
                    honour hinders the possibility of his turning away from the woman he has promised to marry to any
                    other woman from entering her head. Only, seeing, as plainly as if it were another's and not her
                    own, the ruin of the face that meets her, daily and nightly, in the dim oval of the old glass in its
                    tarnished frame, she wishes that that ruin might be revealed slowly, and by degrees (not <hi
                        rend="i">all at once</hi>), to him that had once thought her so fair. For this one night, she
                    would fain look like her old self—would fain be pretty plump <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther
                        Craven</persName>, whose face, dimpled and <hi rend="i"><foreign xml:lang="fr"
                            >débonnaire</foreign></hi>, men used to turn round in the street to look after—instead of
                    the thin depressed "companion," whom if men looked at at all, it was only to pity her sunken white
                    cheeks and sombre mourning weeds. Her Sunday frock is a lugubrious combination of cheap black silk
                    and crape, against which her artistic eye has been revolting ever since she heard of <persName
                        corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName>'s coming. A little white tucker will not make her any
                    the less mindful of <persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName>. And so she has been devoting most
                    of the short winter daylight to the inserting of such a tucker, and to cutting the funereal body
                    square. The alterations have been effected, now the Sunday frock is on: if it had been costliest
                    velvet or satin, instead of papery silk at two-and-sixpence a yard, its black could not have

                    swelling bust. <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> has lost flesh a good deal lately;
                    but, being small-boned and thoroughly well-made, no unsightly hollows show as yet, like
                    salt-cellars, beneath her collar-bones—not yet are elbows or shoulders sharp. Brilliancy of
                    colouring is gone; but the head, arched like the Clyte's, is still left, and great plenty of night
                    dark hair to clothe it. Instead of the unnatural protuberance of a chignon, she has arranged this
                    hair in the thick plain twists with which in the old time <persName corresp="#cblessington">Miss
                        Blessington</persName>'s betrothed used— <quote><l rend="ti-5">...."to play</l>

                    In like twists <persName corresp="#cblessington">Miss Blessington</persName> herself often disposes
                    her locks—twists purchased by her for a considerable price from M. Isidore, golden hair being hard
                    to match, and consequently expensive.</p>
                <p>It is five minutes to six. The toilette is finished, and <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName> stands before the glass considering it; but with none of the triumphant
                    self-content with which a fine woman usually regards the victory that art and nature, fighting side
                    by side, have achieved on the battle-field of her face. Colour had been <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName>'s strong point, and colour has gone from her; as it goes from a violet sent
                    in a letter, or from a poppy dried between the leaves of a love-song. A raging desire for rouge,
                    raddle, plate-powder—anything to bring back that flower-flush that used to need no persuasion to
                    stay with her—enters her mind. But neither rouge nor raddle is near, and for plate-powder she would
                    have to apply to the butler—an effort for which not even her great wish to appear once more
                    red-cheeked before her ex-lover can nerve her. Suddenly, her eyes fall on a spray <pb n="338"
                        xml:id="VAB7385-342"/> of scarlet geranium, that, plucked this morning in the conservatory, she
                    has worn all day in the breast of her dress. A recollection comes to her of having, when a child,
                    crushed one of those dazzling flowers against the face of another child, and of having laughed with
                    pleasure at the scarlet stain. She snatches up eagerly some of the petals, and rubs them on her
                    cheeks; the hue produced, though too scarlet for nature, is vivid and beautifying. She sets to work
                    on the other cheek.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> is not a very cunning artiste; she has no idea of
                    softening off edges with cotton-wool—of working deftly from cheekbone downwards. She is only
                    possessed by a great longing to get back, for this one night, something of her old brilliancy. And
                    in this she partially succeeds. The result of her labours is, indeed, a too hectic bloom; but the
                    bright colour seems to fill up somewhat the hollowed cheeks—seems to bring back a little of the old
                    childish <hi rend="i"><foreign xml:lang="fr">débonnaire</foreign></hi> grace. Her labour ended, she
                    runs downstairs quickly—not giving herself time for remorse at the meretricious nature of her
                    charms, and listens, trembling all over, at the saloon-door before entering. There is no sound
                    except the rolling grunts with which, unheard by himself, the old gentleman accompanies every
                    respiration. A footman crosses the hall; the <q>"companion"</q> must not be caught eavesdropping;

                <p>N<hi rend="sc">EXT</hi> morning <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName> wakes, recovered
                    from his ill temper, his headache, and all the effects of his Irish saturnalia. Perhaps, had he
                    known who it was that lay wakeful in a great ginger four-poster, two doors off, his slumbers would
                    not have been so profound. The hounds meet twelve miles away, at Shepherds Hatch. By nine o'clock he
                    is in the saddle, and riding quietly along the deep Essex lanes and wet fields, with a soft, south
                    wind blowing in his face, and the grass, crisped by the slightest possible frost, beneath the
                    horse's hoofs.</p>
                <p>He is lucky enough to come in for the run of the season; has the satisfaction of seeing many better
                    men than himself floundering, hatless and well-watered, in a brook, or getting croppers over stiff
                    hawthorn hedges; over all which obstacles his grey, a new investment, of whose fencing powers he and
                    his groom had been unjustly doubtful, carries him like a bird. As to whether his ladylove may relish
                    this early preference of <quote>" bold Reynolds "</quote> to herself, any more than she relished his
                    fatigue and headache last night, he troubles <pb n="344" xml:id="VAB7385-348"/> himself but little.
                    He has no intention whatever of being a hen-pecked husband. When he proposed to her, he told her
                    what he could give her, and what he could not—what she might expect, and what she might not: nor has
                    this day's desertion been any departure from his half of the bargain. Somewhere about five o'clock
                    he is back again at Blessington, splashed from head to heel; his tops, in which this morning you
                    might have seen your face, all stained and discoloured; with a dab of mud on each cheek, and a third
                    on the bridge of his nose. He runs upstairs lightly, whistling a tune, and has just reached the
                    first landing, when, <sound>"Click-clack,"</sound> he hears a woman's high-heeled shoes descending.
                    It is <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>, who is walking listlessly down, with her eyes
                    fixed on a great picture let into the wall—a large, white woman, with her clothes tumbling off,
                    hurling her substantial person upon a spear; a young man, with arms like a blacksmith's, lying on
                    the ground, making a profuse display of his charms, and, though with no very perceptible wound,
                    evidently <hi rend="i"><foreign xml:lang="lat">in articulo mortis</foreign></hi>; a fat Cupid
                    blubbering hard by—the whole entitled "Pyramus and Thisbe."</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName> looks upward, to see who the author of the

                        girl?" </said> is his first thought. His second—a thought that makes him stagger back with the
                    colour hurrying from his healthy cheek—a thought full of anger, astonishment, desire, and pain—a
                    thought that involuntarily he speaks aloud, is <said who="#sjgerard">"<persName corresp="#ecraven"

                <p>At almost the same moment she has caught sight of him. In her case, there is no surprise; but the

                <p>No answer. His voice has carried her back, across the gulf of <persName corresp="#jcraven"
                        >Jack</persName>'s death, of her own servitude and failing health, to that night when, in the

                    silent—struggling with a strong, vile, degrading temptation to fling down her tired head upon the
                    shoulder of <persName corresp="#cblessington">Miss Blessington</persName>'s affianced husband, and

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Yes,"</said> she answers, bitterly, strengthened by his tone, in which there is
                    small kindness, and much wrath; <said who="#ecraven">"I am paid fifty pounds a year to visit

                    finds that he still thinks her so.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Is this bondage to last all your life, then?"</said> he inquires more

                <p>A guilty sense of hypocrisy in wishing him happy whom, <pb n="348" xml:id="VAB7385-352"/> less than

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Why could not you have sent me word that you were here, and I would have kept

                <p>He turns away with a muttered exclamation, not benedictory towards his betrothed, between his

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"I will try to be as little annoyance to you as I can,"</said> says the poor

                <p>He takes no notice of her submissive speech, but stands, with his eyes moodily downcast, upon the

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Believe me, I would go away, if I could,"</said> she says, piteously. <said

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Well, it is no business of mine,"</said> he says, harshly, <pb n="349"

                <p>He passes his hand across his forehead, pushing the hair away; and not even the dab of mud on his

                    off, upon his scarlet sleeve. <said who="#ecraven">"Why cannot we let bygones, <pb n="350"

                <p>N<hi rend="i">o</hi> one ever accused the dinners <hi rend="i">en famille</hi> at Felton of being too
                    lively; but, that evening, <persName corresp="#sjgerard">Gerard</persName> decides that they yield
                    the palm, in point of perfect: stagnation, to Blessington. There is, indeed, none of that lynx-eyed
                    watching of the servants, none of that pouncing upon their minutest derelictions, which makes dining
                    in <persName corresp="#tgerard">Sir Thomas</persName>'s company so thoroughly uncomfortable a
                    process : no one calls the fat red-faced butler and the two blue-and-yellow footmen <said

                <p>At Blessington, indeed the servants have things pretty much their own way; and, accustomed to their
                    master's total and mistress's partial deafness, have got into a habit of conversing with one another
                    in a tone of voice considerably above that usually considered seemly in civilised <hi rend="i"

                    though loud mumblings over his food—with the exception of a question, addressed to the butler, as to
                    what the viands upon the table under his sightless eyes consist of. <said who="#butler"

                    dragged up a perpendicular hill.</p>
                <p>The evening is but a prolongation of the dinner, with the additional disadvantage of there being no

                    has the air of one. The old gentleman, rendered surprisingly wakeful by the unwonted incident of the
                    addition of a stranger to his little circle, insists upon hearing a pungent article on Gladstone and
                    the Irish Church, over which he has fallen asleep in the morning, re-read to him by his little white

                <p>T<hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> ancient distich proves true in the year I am speaking of. Not later than
                    Christmas does the moist mild weather last. With January the frost comes hurrying back; hanging
                    great icicles on the house-eaves, throwing men out of work, and pressing with its iron finger the
                    thin faint life out of half-a-dozen old almsmen and almswomen. The foxes have a little
                    breathing-time—a little space in which to steal and eat three or four more fat capons and
                    stubble-fed geese—before that evil day when their dappled foes shall tear their poor little red
                    bodies limb from limb. Hunting is stopped, and men are hurrying up from the shires to London. St.
                    James's Street and its hundred clubs are crowded. At Blessington everybody is pirouetting on the
                    ice. <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName>, passionately fond of all out-of-door sports,
                    spends the whole day on the mere. One afternoon a large party comes <pb n="357" xml:id="VAB7385-361"
                    /> over from Lord Linley's place, five miles away. Not in all Lord Linley's grounds is there such a
                    stretch of smooth ice as the Blessington pool affords; and so they are all come to show their
                    prowess on its hard flat face.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> keeps well out of their way. From her post of
                    obcervation—the deep window-seat in the China gallery— she has watched their arrival, heard their
                    gay voices in the hall, and then, unnoticed, unmissed, she has stolen out upon one of her long,
                    dawdling, cold-giving strolls in the park: over the frost-crisped grass, under the branchy trees,
                    whose staglike crowns cut the pale sky—up little knolls and down into dips where, in summer time,
                    the fern stands neck high. At last she comes in sight of the mere; and, impelled by curiosity,
                    trusting in her own insignificance to escape notice, sits down on a bank that slopes gently down
                    towards the sheet of water, and looks upon the unwonted brilliance of the scene. Girls in velvet
                    short costumes; bright petticoats, furs, hats with humming birds on them, curls, fair chignons,
                    glancing in the cheerful winter sun. Fashion in all its folly and extravagance, but picturesque
                    withal; it is as if a company of Dresden shepherdesses had stepped off the mantelshelf, and come
                    tripping, dainty-footed, over the frozen water. Her eyes follow the shepherdess figures with eager
                    interest—so seldom in her simple country-bred life has she been brought into contact with any of
                    Fashion's bright daughters. The men have less attraction for her. Under no most prosperous
                    conjunction of circumstances could she ever have been a man ; but under happier auspices she might
                    have been one of these fluttering butterflies—a prettier butterfly than any there, her heart tells
                    her. Shylock's words recur to her: <said who="#ecraven">"Am not I <quote>'fed with the same food,

                <p>These are some of the comments that the unknown beauty draws forth. Five minutes later, <persName
                        corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName>'s scruples—such as never having skated before, having
                    no skates, &amp;c.—being overruled by her new acquaintance, she is sitting on the bank; and he,
                    kneeling before her, is fastening some one else's unused skates on her little feet. A great desire
                    for pleasure has come over her—a great longing for warmth and colour in her grey life, that looks
                    all the greyer now in the contrast to the brilliant reds and purples of these strange lives with
                    which it is brought into sudden contact. A great delight in the wintry brightness fills her—in the
                    shifting, varying hues—in the bubbling laughter; a great impulse to laugh too, the spirit of youth
                    rising up in arms against the tyranny of grief.</p>
                <p>The low sun shoots down dazzling crimson rays on the mere's dirty white face. The swans and Solan
                    geese are exiled to a little corner, where the ice has been broken for them, and where they have to
                    keep swimming round and round to prevent the invasion of their little territory by the grasping
                    frost. Girls that cannot skate being pushed about <pb n="362" xml:id="VAB7385-366"/> in chairs;
                        <sound>" Whirr! whirr!"</sound> they rush along the smooth surface at a headlong pace. Men, with
                    their arms stretched out like the sails of a windmill, advancing cautiously—first one foot, then the
                    other—just managing to keep on their feet, and thinking themselves extremely clever for so managing.
                    Other men and women flying hand-in-hand, from one end of the pool to the other, in long, smooth
                    slides—as safe and secure as if running upon their own feet on the grass. Others, cutting eights,
                    and all manner of figures, whirling round upon one leg, and making themselves altogether remarkable.
                    One poor gentleman with his skates in the air, and head starring the ice; brother men laughing and
                    jeering; pretty girls pitying—light laughter mixed with their condolences also. Eight people dancing
                    a quadrille, <hi rend="i"><foreign xml:lang="fr">chaîne des dames</foreign></hi>: in and out, in and
                    out—right, left—go the moving figures, the cerise petticoats, the glancing feet. It is all so pretty
                    and gay. When one has spent the best part of three months in weeping, when one has the quick blood
                    of seventeen in one's veins, one longs to get up and run, and dance, and jump about too.</p>

                    hinder her feet from outrunning body and head. And so she totters along—amused, flattered,
                    frightened; and far too much absorbed in considerations of her own safety, to be at all aware of the
                    condescending notice that several of the more worthy gender are good enough to bestow upon her,
                    though the conceit inborn in the male mind would have made them completely sceptical of that fact,

                    return and fix themselves upon that slender staggering figure in black. Once he sees her on the
                    point of falling—saved only by being caught with quick adroitness in her companion's arms. He draws
                    his breath involuntarily hard. How dare any man but he touch her—lay a finger upon her fair person?
                    One of the old simple instincts, stronger—oh, how far stronger!—than any of the restrictions with
                    which our civilisation has sought to bind them—a great lust of raging jealousy—is upon him.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"I <hi rend="i">hate</hi> her!" </said> he says to himself, fiercely; <said

                        be very ridiculous if it had. It was merely that his look of surprise reminded me of what I
                        ought to have recollected without reminding, that I should have been home an hour
                    ago."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#linley">"Wanted again, I suppose?"</said> says the young man, with the air of an

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"There is a stile close here,"</said> says <persName corresp="#ecraven"

                        poking his ugly nose here, where nobody wanted him; at least I did not, and, to judge by your
                        face, neither did you. Well! when are we to meet again, I wonder?"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Never!—some time or other—soon!"</said> answers <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName>, hastily and contradictorily, running up the gamut of adverbs in search of
                    the one most likely to obtain her release. Having gained that object, she jumps over the stile, and
                    disappears into a sea of mist.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName>, having arrived at Blessington, and given
                    up his horse to a groom, enters the house; but the <pb n="382" xml:id="VAB7385-386"/> confinement of
                    roof and walls is insupportable to him. So he goes out again, and, walking up the avenue, stations
                    himself at the gate. There, resting his arms on the topmost bar, he stands, straining his eyes down
                    the road by which he expects to see <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> and her companion
                    make their appearance.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"They will defer their parting to the last moment—that is of course,"</said> he
                    says to himself, in his lonely pain. <said who="#sjgerard">"Well,"</said> taking out his watch and
                    minuting them, in order to drink the cup of his jealous misery to the dregs, <said who="#sjgerard"
                        >"it is not more than a mile and a half from here to the place where I passed them; let us see

                <p>He has not long to wait. Before five minutes are over he hears the sound of a horse's feet. <said
                        who="#sjgerard">" <persName corresp="#linley">Linley</persName> must not see him watching
                        them,"</said> he thinks, with a sort of shame at himself, and so steps back into the shade of a
                    great tree.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#linley">Linley</persName> rides by <hi rend="i">alone</hi>. His face is turned
                    towards the house, in whose great black facade the lighted windows make oblong-shaped red glories;
                    his eyes are trying to fix upon <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s casement. Of course
                    he hits upon the wrong one, and directs his sentimental gaze towards the apartment where, with wig
                    off and teeth out, <persName corresp="#hblessington">Mrs. Blessington</persName>, aided by her maid,
                    is slowly moving through the stages of her dinner toilette.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"She must have taken the short-cut across the park,"</said> thinks <persName
                        corresp="#sjgerard">Gerard</persName>, with a sense of unwilling relief. <said who="#sjgerard"
                        >"Afraid of my telling tales of her escapade, I suppose."</said></p>
                <p>He retraces his steps down the avenue, and, following a back road that skirts the kitchen-garden,
                    reaches another gate that leads into the park, and there stands and waits again.</p>
                <p>The short-cut has proved rather a long one. Part of the park has been fenced off, to keep the deer
                    and the Scotch <pb n="383" xml:id="VAB7385-387"/> cattle separate; a gate which she had reckoned
                    upon finding open, she discovers to be padlocked, and has to make a long circuit round to another
                    gate.</p>
                <p>As she toils weary-footed through the wet grass, vague alarms assail him that watches for her. Can
                    any evil have come to her in the darkness? Most improbably in that still, safe park. After a while,
                    and when his reasonless fears are beginning to gather more strongly about his heart, he hears the
                    sound as of some one running pantingly. <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> is not so
                    good at running as she was in the old Glan-yr-Afon days. She has been flying along in hot haste,
                    with a mixed fear of Scotch bulls and goblins in pursuit. As she approaches the gate, <persName
                        corresp="#sjgerard">Gerard</persName> opens it for her. Seeing it swing open without any
                    apparent cause, she gives a great nervous start; then, discovering the motive cause of the
                    phenomenon, drops into a walk.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"It is rather late, <persName corresp="#sjgerard">Mr. Gerard</persName>, I'm
                        afraid, isn't it so ?"</said> she asks, with some hesitation at this disobedience to his command
                    of silence. And yet, surely, if he had meant not to speak to her, he would not have come
                    thither.</p>
                <p>Two speech-gifted human beings could hardly be expected to meet with less civility than two pigs, who
                    would at least exchange a grunt.</p>
                <p>He looks at his watch again. <said who="#sjgerard">"It is ten minutes to six,"</said> he replies with
                    punctilious politeness.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Is it <hi rend="i">really?</hi> I had no idea how the time went," she says,
                        apologetically, <said who="#ecraven">"until your look of—of—<hi rend="i">surprise</hi> reminded
                            me."</said></said></p>
                <p>The line of defence she has hit upon is unlucky.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Really!"</said> he answers, stiffly.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"I had not noticed how the light had gone, nor anything about the
                        matter,"</said> she continues, innocently, floundering at every word into deeper disgrace.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"I daresay not,"</said> he replies, freezingly.</p>


                <pb n="384" xml:id="VAB7385-388"/>
                <p>She had addressed him, penitent and humble, willing to take a scolding in all submissiveness, but the
                    chill brevity of his answers turns her meekness to gall.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"When one is in pleasant company,"</said> she remarks, with a rather hysterical

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Undoubtedly,"</said> replies <persName corresp="#sjgerard">Gerard</persName>,
                    endeavouring to conceal his anger under an appearance of calmness, and unable to manage more than
                    one word at a time.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"If one has not taken a vow of perpetual silence, it is a great relief to have a

                            >dumb</hi>,"</said> she says, emboldened by exasperation.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"An immense relief, no doubt,"</said> he answers, in deep displeasure. <said

                    temptation to lecture her—<said who="#sjgerard">"who am so much older than you, and can have no

                <p>He draws himself up to his full height, and a stern expression makes his lip thin. <said
                        who="#sjgerard">"I was right,"</said> he says internally; <said who="#sjgerard">"it was no

                        concern. I only thought that, as you are so young, you might not be aware that nocturnal walks
                        with a man of <persName corresp="#linley">Linley</persName>'s character are not advantageous to

                <p>Then, to avoid the disgrace of seeming to court his compassion by tears, she darts from his side, and
                    rushes to that harbour of refuge—her great, bare sleeping-chamber.</p>

                    through two chapters and a half of "Pamela," which <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>
                    had inadvertently left on the table. Sometimes, to his own surprise, he catches himself wishing that

                        immortality of the soul with intelligent natives."</said></p>
                <p>Now and again conscience's voice thunders at him in the recesses of his soul: <said who="#sjgerard"
                        >"You are paltering with temptation. Arise!—flee!&#8212;begone!" </said> But he, strong in the

                <p>And, in the meantime, that other woman droops like an unwatered flower, day by day. When the
                    mainspring of a watch is broken, must it not stop? If hope, the mainspring of life, be broken, must
                    not life stop—not all at once, as the watch does, but by gentle yet sure degrees? A slow fire burns
                    in the child's veins; before this man had come, she had peace—a sad stagnant peace, indeed, but
                    still peace. <hi rend="i">Now</hi> she lives in a state of perpetual concealed excitement. True,

                    outlook in the China Gallery, she can watch his going forth in the morning, his coming back at
                    evening. At breakfast and dinner he sits opposite to her; she can study his face, with stealthy
                    care, lest she may be observed, while he drives heavily through slow trite talk with her that fills
                    the place in his life that, for a golden day, from one sundown to another, was <persName

                    lightly touches him, as they pass one another dumbly. At night she lies awake, waiting to catch the
                    sound of his footfall in the gallery past her door; has to wait long hours often; for he, unknowing
                    that any one takes note of his vigils, sits in the smoking-room far into the small hours, puffing
                    out of his well-coloured meerschaum <pb n="387" xml:id="VAB7385-391"/> great volumes of
                    smoke—wishing, not seldom, I think, that he could puff away <persName corresp="#cblessington"
                        >Constance</persName>, his beloved, into smoke volumes and thin air.</p>
                <p>Fed by no kindly words, nourished only upon neglect and cold looks, <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName>'s love for <persName corresp="#sjgerard">Gerard</persName> yet strikes out
                    great roots downwards—shoots forth strong branches upwards. A tree of far statelier growth it stands
                    than in the days when the soft gales and gentle streams of answering love fanned and watered it. Who
                    cares for what they can have? Who cries for the moon? It is the intermediate something—the something
                    that lies just a handbreadth beyond the utmost stretch of our most painfully-strained arms, that we
                    eat out our hearts in longing for.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> never goes beyond the park palings now, deterred by
                    the fear of being waylaid by <persName corresp="#linley">Linley</persName>. She need not have been
                    alarmed. As long as she came naturally in his way, he was delighted to see her: as we stoop and pick
                    gladly the fruit that drops off the tree at our feet. He had even, on a day when the frost forbade
                    hunting, and when he had got tired of skating, taken the unwonted trouble of riding over to
                    Blessington, to warm himself at the fire of those great black eyes, that have still for him the
                    charm of novelty upon them; but women, many and fair, came too readily to his hand to make him very
                    keen in the chase of any one individual woman. In former generations men used to be the pursuers,
                    women the pursued. In this generation we, who have set right most things, have set right this also.
                        <hi rend="i">Now</hi>, the hares pursue the harriers, the foxes the hounds, and the doves swoop
                    upon the falcons.</p>
                <p>During these latter evenings <persName corresp="#jblessington">Mr. Blessington</persName> has been
                    very alert and wakeful—has insisted on being read to from tea to bed-time—a liberal hour. But,

                        >Gerard</persName> never now comes to the rescue, never interferes, though the frequent teasing

                    sword. With steady certainty, through frost and thaw, rain and shine, through all the alternations
                    of an English winter, the young girl's health declines. To all but herself is this fact evident, and
                    she, unaccustomed to illness—never having seen the signs of premature decay in others—thinks it is
                    but a little weariness, a little languor, a nothing. It will pass when the swooned world revives
                    into spring and the buttercups come.</p>
                <p>Sunday is here again, the initial letter in the week's alphabet: <quote><l rend="ti-3">"The Sundays

                <p>Ah me! the languid, yawning Sundays of most of us will make but sorry bracelets for any one,
                    methinks. Sunday—the day on which the Shelford shopboys and shopgirls walk about gloriously
                    apparelled, arm-in-arm, man and maid, filling their lungs with country air,—day on which the
                    gentlefolks, such as are men of them, debarred from horse and hound and cue, smoke a cigar or two
                    more than usual over the instructive pages of Messieurs De Kock, Sue, Balzac, &amp;c.; while such as
                    are women, being for the most part piously disposed, hold Goulburn's "Thoughts on Personal
                    Religion," or Hannay's "Last Day of Our Lord's Passion," open on their velvet laps, and kill a
                    reputation between each paragraph.</p>
                <p>On this especial Sunday <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> has risen, feeling feebler,
                    more nerveless than usual. Something in the influence of the weather—soft, sodden, sunless—weighs
                    upon her with untold oppression. She would fain not go to church, remain at home, and lie on her
                    bed; but this cannot be. Foremost in importance, in indispensability, among her duties are these <pb
                        n="389" xml:id="VAB7385-393"/> Sunday ones. If the weather be tolerable, <persName
                        corresp="#jblessington">Mr. Blessington</persName> is always scrupulously punctual in attending
                    Divine worship. Leaning on his valet's arm, he totters up the church, in his old tail-coat, tightly
                    buttoned over his sunken chest, and, arrived at the Blessington pew, is deposited in a little nook
                    thereof, partitioned (in some quirk of his, while he could yet see) from the rest. In thia nook
                    there is room for two people—to wit, for <persName corresp="#jblessington">Mr.
                        Blessington</persName>, and for the happy person who is to guide his devotions. And to conduct
                        <persName corresp="#jblessington">Mr. Blessington</persName>'s prayers and praises is, I assure
                    you, no sinecure. Almost entirely deaf, almost entirely blind, he is yet resolute to take a part in
                    the services by no means less prominent than the clerk's. It is, therefore, his attendant's duty to
                    shout the responses in his ear, in order to give him some clue to the portion of the ritual which
                    has been arrived at and to check him with elbowings and nudgings, when his aberrations from the
                    right path become so flagrantly noticeable as to distract the attention of the other worshippers.
                    But too often, however, the attempts at repression on the part of the acolyte are so much labour
                    lost. In the region of darkness and silence in which his infirmities have placed him, the old man
                    frequently becomes impatient of the slow progress of the service as notified to him by the roars of
                    his companion. Not seldom he proclaims, in a voice distinctly audible throughout the building, the
                    point at which, according to his reckoning, priest and people should have arrived. <said
                        who="#jblessington">"And with thy spirit,"</said> cries the squire, with unction in his deep,
                    tremulous bass, while the sleek young rector's gentle <said>"The Lord be with you"</said> does not
                    follow till five minutes later. In the Creed there is but one course to pursue: to start him, if
                    possible, fair—happy, indeed, if he does not insist on turning to the altar somewhere towards the
                    close of the second lesson or beginning of the Jubilate,—to start him fair, I say. and then in
                    despair, give him his head. <pb n="390" xml:id="VAB7385-394"/> Fervently, loudly, rapidly, he
                    announces his belief in the articles of the Christian faith, while parson, clerk, and congregation
                    toil after him in vain. Occasionally—especially at such portions of the service as refer to our need
                    of forgiveness, our sinfulness, our mortality,—he breaks out into senile tears; too deaf to hear his
                    own penitent sobs, he has no idea of the loudness with which they reverberate through the church.
                    Strangers, hearing, perk their heads up above their pews, and then fling them down again on their
                    pocket-handkerchiefs convulsed with inextinguishable laughter; but the greater part of the
                    assemblage are used to these spasms of grotesque devotion—it is only <distinct>"t'oud

                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> always draws a long breath of relief when <quote><l

                <p>On the Sunday I speak of <distinct>"t'oud squoire's"</distinct> prayers were more unruly than usual.
                    Whether it was that <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s weakened voice was unable to
                    guide them into the right channel, or to whatever other cause assignable, certain it is that his
                    vagaries were more painfully evident—ludicrously to the congregation, distressingly to his
                    family—than on any former Sunday within the memory of man. Many heads turn towards the Blessington
                    pew ; even the rector—meekest among M.A.s—looks now and again with gentle reproach at the old man,
                    who is, with such aggressive loudness, usurping his office of leading the devotions of his flock. A
                    proud woman is <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther Craven</persName> when the Liturgy comes to a
                    close. In the sermon there are, thank God, no responses for the congregation to make; it is not even
                        <pb n="391" xml:id="VAB7385-395"/> customary to cry, <said>"Hear, hear!"</said>
                    <said>"Hallelujah!"</said>
                    <said>"More power to you!"</said> at intervals. In the sermon, therefore, the old gentleman composes
                    himself to sleep, and there is peace.</p>
                <p>The Blessington pulpit is to-day occupied by a stranger—a Boanerges, or Son of Thunder, in the shape
                    of a muscular, half-educated, fluent Irishman—a divine who would fain <hi rend="i">flog</hi> his
                    hearers to heaven, show them the way upwards by the light of hell's flambeaux—one of that too
                    numerous class who revel in disgusting descriptions, and similes drawn from our mortality. It is
                    impossible to help listening to him, and difficult to help being sick. <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName> listens, trembling, while he descants with minute relish on <quote>"the worm
                        that never dies."</quote> The worm that never dies! Surely, a terrible picture enough, in its
                    simple bareness, without enlargement thereupon! With imagination rendered more vivid, and reason
                    weakened by sickness, the unhappy girl pictures that worm gnawing at her brother's heart—gnawing,
                    crawling, torturing eternally. She covers her face with her hands; it is too horrible! A sort of
                    sick feeling comes over her—a giddy faintness. If she can but reach the open air ! She rises
                    unsteadily, opens the pew-door, and walks as in a mist down the aisle, between the two rows of
                    questioning faces, and so out. As she passes through the church-door she staggers slightly, and
                    catches at the wall for support. <persName corresp="#sjgerard">Gerard</persName>, watching her
                    anxiously, sees her unsteady gait, and the involuntary gesture of reaching out for some stay for her
                    tottering figure. Instantly, without giving thought to the light in which his beloved may regard his
                    proceeding, he, rising, quickly follows the young girl. She has just managed to reach a flat
                    tombstone, and there sits, with her face turned thirstily westwards, whence a small soft wind blows <choice>

                        suspended, and all the vital functions; and yet he feels and sees and hears more acutely than
                        when in strong health. Why may not death, too, be a catalepsy?"</said></p>

                <p>The havoc worked in face and figure by the last few months is too directly under his eyes for him to

                    clergyman, the school-children, and the organist to go to church in the afternoon. The old people
                    sleep side by side in the blaze of the saloon-fire ; being, both of them, happily deaf, they are
                    undisturbed by each other's grunts and snores.</p>
                <p>Since the beginning of <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName>'s visit, the north
                    drawing-room has been made over to him and his betrothed to be affectionate in, so that they may
                    enjoy, uninterrupted, those fits of affection to which all engaged people are supposed, and
                    sometimes unjustly supposed, to be liable. Whether they have reached the requisite pitch of warmth
                    on the afternoon I speak of is, to say the least, doubtful; but, all the same, in the north
                    drawing-room they are. <persName corresp="#cblessington">Constance</persName> leans back in an
                    armchair, rather listless. She is <pb n="399" xml:id="VAB7385-403"/> fond of work, and it is not
                    right to work on Sunday : her feet repose on a foot-stool before her—her eyes are fixed upon them:
                    she is thinking profoundly whether steel buckles a size smaller than the ones she is at present

                    horses taking impossible fences, prize pigs, ballet-girls, little skeleton men squaring up at one
                    another. He, too, is thinking—but not of shoe-buckles. He has got something to say to <persName

                    first second imagines, but (as a second glance informs her) on some object outside the window. Her

                        the safeguard of any love to yourself—you yet let me fall into this temptation—the cruelest I
                        could have been exposed to—without a word of warning. Was this fair? Was this right?"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#cblessington">"Since you put me on my defence,"</said> she answers, with anger, <said

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"You meant well, perhaps,"</said> he rejoins, with a sigh that is more than

                <p>She makes no rejoinder, and he, rising, begins to walk up and down the room with his hands in his
                    pockets. He has made his meaning clear enough, surely, and yet she does not appear to see it. As she
                    continues resolutely silent, he stops opposite to her, and speaks earnestly, and yet with some
                    embarrassment, as one who knows that what he says will be unpleasing to his listener.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"<persName corresp="#cblessington">Constance</persName>, I must tell you the

                        untruths that you have been used to all your life. But, at least, it is better that you should
                        hear it now, thar that we should tell it one another a year hence, with mutual, useless
                        recriminations; there is no use in disguising the fact that you and I do not feel towards each
                        other as husband and wife should feel."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#cblessington">"Pshaw!"</said> she says, pettishly, turning her head aside; <said
                        who="#cblessington">"we feel much the same as other people do, I daresay."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"If,"</said> he continues, very gravely, <said who="#sjgerard">"marriage were a
                        temporary connection, that lasted a year—five years say—or that could be dissolved at pleasure,
                        there might be no great harm in entering upon it with the sort of negative liking, the absence
                        of repugnance for one another, which is all that we can boast; but since it is a bargain for all
                        time, and that there is no getting out of it except by the gate of death or disgrace, I think we
                        ought both to reflect on it more seriously than we have yet done before undertaking
                    it."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#cblessington">"It is rather late in the day to say all this,"</said> retorts she,
                    indignantly. <said who="#cblessington">"You have known me all my life; you must have been well aware
                        that I never could enter into those highflown, romantic notions, which I have heard you yourself
                        ridicule a hundred times. These objections should have occurred to you before you proposed to
                        me, and not now, when we have been engaged two months, and when <pb n="404" xml:id="VAB7385-408"
                        /> our marriage has been discussed as a settled thing by all our acquaintance."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"You are right,"</said> he answers, quietly. <said who="#sjgerard">"They should
                        have occurred to me before ; but, in justice to myself, I must say that they would never have
                        occurred to me: I should have remained in the same state of supine indifference to everything in
                        which I came here, had not you yourself thrown me in the way of <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                            >Esther Craven</persName>."</said></p>
                <p>She sits upright in her chair; her pale, handsome face paler, harder than usual, in her great anger.
                        <said who="#cblessington">"The drift of this long tirade, when translated into plain English,
                        is, I suppose, that you wish to marry <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther Craven</persName>
                        instead of me?"</said></p>
                <p>He is silent.</p>
                <p><said who="#cblessington">"Is it so?"</said> she repeats, her voice raised several notes above its
                    wonted low key.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"When I am engaged to one woman,"</said> he answers, slowly, reluctantly, yet
                    steadily, <said who="#sjgerard">"I hope I am not dishonourable enough willingly to harbour the
                        thought of marriage with any other."</said></p>
                <p>The Gerard diamonds flash before her mind's eye: they are so big, and numerous—necklace, aigrette,
                    stomacher. The idea of seeing them gleam restless in <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                    >Esther</persName>'s hair, on <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s fair neck, is
                    insupportable to her. She will not release him, ardently as he wishes it; she will hold him by a
                    strong chain that will not snap—his honour.</p>
                <p><said who="#cblessington">"I am glad to hear it,"</said> she answers, coldly. <said
                        who="#cblessington"> "In common fairness to me, you could hardly have entertained such an idea.
                        It is a great disadvantage to a girl to be engaged, to have her engagement as widely known as
                        mine has been, and then to have it broken off; people never think the same of her
                    again."</said></p>
                <p>He turns to the window, to hide his bitter disappointment. <said who="#sjgerard">"Very well,"</said>
                    he answers, calmly; <said who="#sjgerard">"things will remain <pb n="405" xml:id="VAB7385-409"/> as
                        they are, I suppose, then? I only thought it right to warn you how small a chance of happiness
                        there is in a marriage so loveless as ours: for the rest you must blame yourself."</said></p>

                <p>N<hi rend="sc">IGHT'S</hi> black sheet drawn off the other half of the world is thrown over us; the
                    dark side of the lantern is turned towards us. <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> has
                    fallen asleep, with almost a happy smile upon her soft, parted lips. She is forgiven; and is there
                    any sweetness like the sweetness of being pardoned, having sinned? He no longer hates her! That was
                    not hate that looked out of his quick, keen eyes to-day, as he leant over her while she sat, dizzy
                    and faint, on that church- yard slab, or as he knelt in strong emotion at her knees, And now, though
                    at her own telling, he is going away from her to-morrow—though, when next they meet, either they
                    will have put off mortality's tatters, God will have laid <quote><l rend="center">"Death, like a
                            kiss, across their lips;"</l></quote> or else, to look and lean as he looked and leant
                    to-day will be deadly sin—yet creeps there a sorrowful joy about her heart. He has given her back
                    the past—the short, happy Felton past; no one can take it from her again; not even <persName
                        corresp="#cblessington">Miss Blessington</persName>, who has taken all else—present and future
                    and all. She is dreaming of him now—dreaming that she is sitting in the library at Felton, in the
                    fragrant gloom made by the lowered Venetian blinds, by dark oak book- shelves, by plentiful sweet
                    flowers, and so sitting hears the sound of his quick feet coming along the passage. He is at the
                    door—he is opening it. But, ah! what is this—it will <pb n="406" xml:id="VAB7385-410"/> not open; it
                    is stiff on its hinges. He is pushing it—pushing gently, pushing hard—but it will not move. What a
                    stealthy noise it is he makes, as if he were afraid of some one hearing him! She starts up, broad
                    awake; it is not all dream; there is some one pushing stealthily, yet audibly, against a door. For
                    the first bewildered moment of sick fear she imagines that it is her own door on which this attempt
                    is being made; but a moment's listening undeceives her. The sound comes from underneath her window,
                    apparently. It is not rats this time; a rat, with all its ingenuity, would be puzzled to make a
                    noise so distinctly human. Upon her mind there flashes suddenly the recollection of a door leading
                    into the garden beneath her casement, but not so immediately beneath but that she can see it; a door
                    that stands wide open all the summer through, when people step from house to garden, from garden to
                    house, a hundred times a day, but which in winter is rarely used. She sits up motionless, while
                    round her utter darkness surges. The noise is repeated: <sound>push—push! creak—creak!</sound> it is
                    as if some one, with hand and knee, were attempting to obtain entrance. When light is withdrawn
                    hearing becomes preternaturally sharpened; in an instant she has jumped out of bed, and run barefoot
                    over the cold boards to the window. There, pulling aside the blind, she, trembling all over, peeps
                    out. Moon is there none, but the joint light of countless star-squadrons, faint though it be, is yet
                    strong enough to enable her distinctly to make out the figure of a man pressing itself against the
                    door in question. With bodily eyes she at length looks upon that burglar, whom, with the terrified
                    eyes of imagination, she had so often beheld. Whether he wear a crape mask or not it is too dark to
                    discern. What is she to do?—she, in all probability, the only wakeful, conscious being in all that
                    great house. For a minute she stands irresolute, while a rushing sound fills her <pb n="407"
                        xml:id="VAB7385-411"/> ears, and her teeth chatter dismally in the cold. Shall she alarm the
                    servants? But how to reach them? She does not even know the way to their sleeping-places. They are
                    miles away, in the other wing of the house, where she has never been. Shall she go to <persName
                        corresp="#cblessington">Miss Blessington</persName>? At least she knows the way thither, though
                    it is some distance off. But of what avail would that be? Of what use would two girls be, any more
                    than one, against the onslaught of daring unscrupulous robbers? Shall she betake herself to
                        <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName>, whose room is but two doors off? No sooner
                    does this idea suggest itself to her, than she puts it into practice. Hastily striking a light, and
                    wrapping her dressing-gown round her, she opens her door, and, flying down the passage, knocks
                    loudly at <persName corresp="#sjgerard">Mr. Gerard</persName>'s. But <persName corresp="#sjgerard"
                        >Gerard</persName>, having a not particularly bad conscience, and a particularly good digestion,
                    is a sound sleeper. She knocks again, more violently, almost to the flaying of her knuckles: <said

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">" <hi rend="i">Esther!—you!</hi>" </said> says the voice, perfectly awake this

                <p>He hurries on his clothes, and then hastens to accede to her request of opening the door.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Are you ill?"</said> he asks, anxiously, seeing her lean against the

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"No—no!"</said> she cries, with all a woman's unreason. <said who="#ecraven"
                        >"Don't go; you must not!"</said> (though for what other purpose she had sought his assistance
                    she would have been puzzled to say). <said who="#ecraven">"I won't let you; you'll be killed!"
                    </said> and so, gasping, stretches out her white arms towards him, and, letting drop her candle,
                    falls insensible, in the total darkness, into his embrace.</p>
                <p>For a month past or more, the dream that has pursued <persName corresp="#sjgerard">Gerard</persName>
                    night and day—unchecked in sleep, in waking faintly repressed by considerations of honour—is to hold
                    that fair woman's form in his arms; and now he so holds her in reality. And yet, as the fulfilment
                    of our wishes seldom affords us the gratification we had anticipated, so it is with him. Now that he
                    has got her, he does not quite know what to do with her. Shall he, encumbered by his beautiful
                    burden, grope his way back into his room, and lay her down there, while he goes and investigates
                    into the cause of her terror and swoon? But the household, being alarmed, may find her there; and,
                    so finding, would not the reputation of her, most innocent, be endangered? Her head droops heavy in
                    its perfect lifelessness on his shoulder; her soft warm hair caresses his cheek in the blackness of
                    the night. He looks down the passage. From <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s open
                    door a flood of light streams; at all events there is a candle left burning there. In a moment he
                    has borne her into her own chamber, and has laid her most gently down upon the ginger-moreen bed. He
                    has no time to try and revive her now. <said who="#sjgerard">"Perhaps it was only her own
                        imagination, poor child!—her own imagination, and those infernal rats!"</said> is the hasty
                    thought that has crossed his mind; but looking through the window, as she had done, he sees, as she
                    had seen, a man's dim figure in the starlight. Without a moment's delay, without casting another
                    thought even to the fair swooned woman he leaves behind him, <persName corresp="#sjgerard"
                        >Gerard</persName> runs <pb n="409" xml:id="VAB7385-413"/> down the corridor, his blood
                    pleasantly astir with the thought of a possible adventure—through interminable dark galleries, down
                    the gleaming cold of white stone stairs, through hall, saloon, north drawing-room, and
                    justicing-room—till he reaches a narrow short passage that leads to the garden door. As he and his
                    light draw near, the noise suddenly ceases. He stands still for a moment, expecting to hear it
                    repeated, but it is not. Setting down his candle, therefore, he advances towards the door and
                    unfastens it—it is secured by an old-fashioned catch inside—opens it, and looks out into the night.
                    At first he can discern nothing but the chill wintry garden, and the million stars scattered
                    broadcast over God's one great unenclosed field of the sky; but a second glance reveals to him a dim
                    figure crouching indistinct in the shadow of a projecting buttress.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Who's there?"</said> he cries, in a loud clear voice.</p>
                <p>No answer.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Who's there?"</said> he repeats. <said who="#sjgerard">"If you don't answer,
                        I'll fire."</said></p>
                <p>Firing, in this instance, must mean using the flat candlestick as a projectile, for other weapon has
                        <persName corresp="#sjgerard">Mr. Gerard</persName> none. Hardly have the words left his mouth,
                    however, before the figure springs forth from its hiding-place, and stands erect before him.</p>
                <p><said who="#footman">"Don't fire, sir, please; it's I."</said></p>
                <p>Livery-buttons flash in the starlight: behold the culprit revealed!—a young and lighthearted footman,
                    who has on one or two previous occasions been suspected of a too great proclivity towards the
                    nocturnal festivities of the "Chequers." A sense of infuriation at the bald tame end of the
                    adventure gets possession of <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName>.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"What the devil do you mean, sir, skulking here, alarming the whole household,
                        and frightening the young ladies out of their senses?" </said> he asks, with a gruff asperity
                    not unworthy of his papa.</p>

                <p><said who="#footman">"If you please, sir,"</said> replies the man, hanging his head, and looking very

                <p>Relieved at being let off so easily, the young fellow slinks away, and Gerard retraces his steps
                    upstairs again. He cannot help laughing as he thinks of poor <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName>'s tragic fears, of her agonised pleadings: <said>" You <hi rend="i">must</hi>

                        me outright this time."</said> Having reached her door, he pauses and listens. There is no sound
                    within. He knocks gently—no answer: knocks again—still no reply. Half-hesitating, as one that stands
                    doubtful on the threshold of a church, he opens the door and enters. The light burns on the
                    dressing-table, and she lies still prone, where he had laid her, on the bed, still completely
                    insensible. This swoon is horribly deathlike: <quote><l rend="ti-3">"...........But she lies</l>

                    back, and her round chin slightly raised. Over the tossed pillow wander the tangled riches of her
                    swart hair; nerveless on the counterpane lie the white, carven hands and blue-veined wrists, on
                    which the faint fine lines make a tender network. Half-shadowed by her dressing-gown, half-emerging
                    from it gleam bare feet, <quote><l rend="center"> "That make the blown foam neither swift nor
                            white."</l></quote> He leans over her, gazing with passionate admiration at the heavy shut
                    lids and upward curling lashes—with passionate admiration mixed with sharp pain; for he can see,
                    plainlier now in this long quiet look than in the hasty, stolen glances he has hitherto given her,
                    the purple stains under closed eyes, the little depressions in the rounded cheek, the droop of the
                    sweet sorrowful mouth. Iachimo's words recur to him—Iachimo's, as he gazed in his treachery upon the
                    sleeping beauty of Imogen: <quote><l rend="ti-3">".........Cytherea!</l>

                <p>But looking at a person with ever such warm approbation will not recover them from a swoon. What is
                    he to do? He is horribly puzzled, so seldom before has he seen a fainted fellow-Christian. Vague
                    ideas of having heard of burnt feathers held under nostrils recur to his mind. But whence to obtain
                    feathers, unless he takes a pair of scissors and snips a hole in the feather-bed? There is nothing
                    in all the great room more feathery than the stumpy end of an old quill pen, with which <persName
                        corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName> is wont to indite her small accounts. Another specific
                    flashes before his mental eye. Smelling-salts! He walks to the dressing-table, and carefully
                    overlooks its slender load: brushes and combs, a Bible, and a fat pincushion—neither essence,
                    unguent, nor scent of any kind. <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s toilette apparatus
                    is but meagre. Shall he throw cold water over her? What! and deluge all the ginger moreen bed,
                    thereby making it an even more undesirable resting-place than it is at present? Quite at a loss what
                    to do, he returns to the bedside, and begins to chafe her cold hands between his two warm ones. Then
                    he stoops over her, trying to discover any smallest sign of returning consciousness. When his lips
                    are so close to hers, how can he help laying them yet closer? Men seldom do resist any temptation,
                    unless it is very weak, and the objections to it very overwhelming. This temptation is not weak, and
                    there are absolutely no objections to it. No one will ever know of this theft—not even the person
                    upon whom it is committed: it will do her <pb n="413" xml:id="VAB7385-417"/> no harm, and to kiss
                    her even thus unknowing, unreturning, gives him a bitter joy. But, having once kissed her, he
                    refrains himself, nor lays his lips a second time upon hers. Something of shame comes over him, as
                    one that has taken advantage of another's helplessness—one that, for an instant, has let the brute
                    within him get the upper hand of the man. Only he caresses gently her two cold hands, and his eyes
                    dwell on her face, watching longingly for the first small symptom of back-coming life. His patience
                    is rewarded, after a time; after a time there comes a quivering about the eyelids, a tremor about
                    the mouth—then a deep-drawn sighing respiration. Always with a sigh does the soul come back to its
                    dark cottage, having journeyed away from it for awhile. The curtain-lids sweep back from the
                    spirit's windows; and, pale and clear, her eyes' dark glories shine upon him, conscious yet
                    bewildered. Then a little stealing red, like the tint that dwelt in a sea-shell's lips, flows into
                    each pure cheek; then comes full consciousness, and with it recollected terrors. <said

                <p>Recollecting what his own method of bringing her round had been, his conscience gives him a

                    twist up her hair with both hands. <said who="#sjgerard">"You are better now,"</said> he says,

                    tartly, vexed past speaking at being discovered in such an utterly false position.</p>
                <p><said who="#cblessington">"I suppose I may be allowed to ask what brings <hi rend="i">you</hi> here?"
                    </said> she says, drawing herself up to her stately height.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"You certainly may,"</said> he answers, endeavouring to recover his
                    self-possession; <said who="#sjgerard">"and I have not the slightest objection to telling you. What
                        brought me here was the endeavour to recover <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName>
                        from a faint into which she fell on coming to tell me—as the only person within her reach—that a
                        man was, as she imagined, endeavouring to break into the house."</said></p>
                <p>Even to his own ears this tale, as he tells it, sounds wofully improbable.</p>
                <p><said who="#cblessington">"And you took no steps to prevent him?"</said> cries <persName
                        corresp="#cblessington">Constance</persName>, quickly; her fears for her personal safety, for
                    the moment, outweighing the claims of outraged virtue.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Pardon me! I did; but having discovered that it was only one of the footmen,
                        who had been accidentally locked <pb n="415" xml:id="VAB7385-419"/> out, I came back to tell
                            <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName> so, if she were recovered! and, if not,
                        to give her that assistance which any one human being may render to another without being called
                        to account for it."</said></p>
                <p>Having spoken, he folds his arms, and confronts her, calm and stately as herself.</p>
                <p><said who="#cblessington">"I should hardly have imagined it was <hi rend="i">your</hi>
                        business,"</said> she replies, with scarce-concealed incredulity. <said who="#cblessington">"May
                        I ask why you could not ring for the servants?"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Because, as you are well aware,"</said> he answers, trying to quell his rising
                    anger, <said who="#sjgerard">"if I were to ring from now till doomsday, not a soul would hear me;
                        all the bells ring downstairs, and the servants' bedrooms are at least a quarter of a mile
                        distant up-stairs."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#cblessington">"Why could not you have come to me, then?"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"The impropriety would, in that case, have been at least equal,"</said> he
                    answers, sarcastically; <said who="#sjgerard">"and, to tell you the truth, such a course never
                        occurred to me."</said></p>
                <p>Something in his tone irritates her. <said who="#cblessington">"It is, of course, no concern of
                        mine,"</said> she says, with icy coldness. <said who="#cblessington">"If <persName
                            corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName> chooses to receive the visits of gentlemen, <hi

                <p>She moves towards the door, but he places himself between her and it; and, grasping her wrist with
                    unconscious roughness, speaks in a voice low and hoarse with anger, while his roused wrath glances
                    upon her from out of his grey eyes—the eyes that hitherto have looked upon her only with
                    indifference.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"<persName corresp="#cblessington">Constance</persName>! what do you mean by
                        these insults? How dare you give utterance to them? Is your own mind so impure that you cannot
                        believe in the purity of others?"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#cblessington">"You must allow that it is at least an equivocal position,"</said> she
                    answers, half-frightened by his stern looks, but keeping resolutely to her text.</p>

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"It is,"</said> he answers, remorsefully; <said who="#sjgerard">"I allow it—I
                        bitterly feel it. And yet, if it were only myself that were concerned, I should scorn to descend
                        to any more explanation than that I have already given you ; but for the sake of this most
                        innocent girl, whom by my folly I have compromised, I swear to you, <persName
                            corresp="#cblessington">Constance</persName>—I solemnly take God to witness!—that it is
                        exactly and simply as I have told you. <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName> had
                        not recovered from her insensibility more than two minutes before you came into the room; I was
                        in the act of leaving it as you entered. This is the whole plain truth: do you believe
                        it?"</said></p>
                <p>She does not answer.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Do you believe it?"</said> he repeats, earnestly.</p>
                <p>The mulish look comes into her face—the look he has begun to know so well.</p>
                <p><said who="#cblessington">"It cannot be of much consequence to you whether I believe it or
                        not,"</said> she answers, still with that freezing calm of voice and face. <said
                        who="#cblessington">"You have, at all events, adopted the best method of obtaining your release
                        from that engagement, which you so broadly hinted, only yesterday afternoon, that you wished to
                        be free from. You have your wish—you are free!" </said></p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"As you will,"</said> he answers, gloomily. <said who="#sjgerard">"God knows
                        there never was much love in our connection; an iller-mated pair never came together; it was a
                        mere matter of business on both sides. But, as to saying that the pure accident which has
                        brought Miss Craven and me into slight and transient collision to-night can have any influence
                        upon the conclusion or continuance of our engagement—it is tantamount to telling me that what I
                        have sworn to you, upon my honour as a gentleman, to be true, is false!"</said> he says, his
                    face growing white and fierce.</p>
                <p><said who="#cblessington">"Is it?"</said> she says, with a quietly enraging smile; having that
                    confidence in the shield of womanhood, which makes so <pb n="417" xml:id="VAB7385-421"/> many a
                    woman gall a man to the uttermost, and expect him to stand by, serene, polite, and smiling. <said
                        who="#cblessington">"Unfortunately,"</said> she continues, <said who="#cblessington">"I am
                        behind the spirit of the age; I am shackled with obsolete old notions of propriety and decency;
                        and therefore—as you have no longer any smallest control over my actions—will you be so good as
                        to allow me to go?"</said></p>
                <p>He drops her hand instantly, and, opening the door for her, bows his head haughtily, saying, <said
                        who="#sjgerard">"Go! I have neither the wish nor the power to detain you;"</said> and as he so
                    speaks she passes out.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>, having slidden from her bed, stands with
                    trembling limbs, grasping the back of a chair, and gazing from speaker to speaker with a world of
                    surprise and horror in her great innocent eyes. As <persName corresp="#cblessington">Miss

                <p>She turns away from him, and covers her burning face with her hands. <said who="#ecraven"
                        >"Go!"</said> she says, faintly—<said who="#ecraven">"go, this minute! Don't say another word!

                    the memory of the Gerard diamonds, lays down her golden scented head on her pillow again, and sleeps
                    the sleep of the just. <persName corresp="#cblessington">Miss Blessington</persName> has well nigh
                    mastered the secret of eternal youth and perennial beauty—incapacity for feeling any emotion. It is

                    the brains of <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName> and <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName>: he goes away from them utterly, taking his gentle poppyheads with him.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName> walks miles and miles up and down his bedroom
                    carpet, pondering, deeply and vexedly, not on what his own course of conduct shall be—<hi rend="i"
                        >that</hi> he is already determined upon—but on what effect <persName corresp="#cblessington"

                <p>And <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> herself, having conceived a mortal aversion for
                    the shelter of the ginger-canopied pavilion, wraps a great shawl round her, and, sitting down on the
                    deep window-seat, watches for the first streaks of dawn, which, on these winter mornings, are long,
                    long coming. Though it is a winter night, her hands burn hot and dry; for the last few days she has
                    had a sharp pain in her side—to-night it is getting yet sharper; it begins to hurt her to draw her
                    breath. Two thoughts keep buzzing about her brain: <said who="#ecraven">"I am going to be
                        ill,"</said> and <said who="#ecraven">"I am going to be turned away."</said> She throws aside
                    her shawl, but the dry burning still continues. She has sat here for hours now, and the dawn's feet
                    are beginning slowly to climb the steps from the eastern gate. The battle between day and night is
                    yet undecided; almost equally they divide the sky between them. Perhaps it is the night's excitement
                    that has given her this fever; perhaps the cold morning air would refresh her. She waits until day's
                    victory is complete, and then—being already dressed—puts on her hat and jacket, and steals
                    noiselessly <pb n="419" xml:id="VAB7385-423"/> downstairs, to the garden door that has been the
                    cause of so much mischief, out into the garden between the brown earthed beds, where the winter
                    aconite's small yellow heads and green tippets are beginning to push themselves into sight, and
                    thence into the park.</p>
                <p>There is no wind abroad, only heavy rain-clouds outwalling the infant sun, and the unarmed air has a
                    piercing chillness in it. <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> has not proceeded far, and
                    is standing thoughtful on the brow of a little knoll, from whence one looks down on the dark

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Because,"</said> he answers, with emotion, fixing his upbraiding eyes upon
                        her—<said who="#sjgerard">"because I was smarting miserably under the blow you had just given
                        me—you, who had made me mistrust everything attractive, and womanly, and innocent-seeming. I was
                        obliged to marry some one; that is one of the many curses attached to being an eldest son, and
                        the last male heir of an inconveniently old family. I said to myself, 'She is too dull to
                        deceive me, too passionless to disgrace me.' I chose her because she was, of all the women I
                        knew, the one least capable of calling forth emotion of any kind whatever in me—consequently,
                        the one most powerless to make me suffer."</said></p>
                <p>The words of his defence came quick and hurried. She is silent for a moment; then, uplifting
                    imploring eyes to his: <said who="#ecraven">"Mr. Gerard,"</said> she says, tremblingly, <said

                        have you come to say 'good-bye' to me? If so, it is well; you remember your promise?"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"I remember it,"</said> he answers, slowly, "<said who="#sjgerard">and I am

                    morning with eager passion—<said who="#sjgerard">"I am ready to swear to you that I will never leave
                        you again, unless you send me away, until death do us part. Will that promise do as well as the

                <p>She gives a little cry of astonishment. <said who="#ecraven">"What do you mean?"</said> she asks,
                    faintly, moving a step farther away from him.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"I mean,"</said> he says, solemnly, his countenance all shining with the light
                    of a great new joy, <said who="#sjgerard">"that I am sick of my life without you, <persName
                            corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>; and you—you are sick of yours without me, aren't
                        you?"</said></p>
                <p>She cannot deny it, and is unwilling to allow it; so keeps a troubled silence.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"There must be some reason,"</said> he continues, passionately, <said
                        who="#sjgerard">"for your failing health, for your thin white cheeks, for your total loss of
                        beauty" </said> (with a smile), <said who="#sjgerard">"as <persName corresp="#cblessington"
                            >Constance</persName> tersely worded it yesterday. Am I right; or is it my conceit that
                        makes me think that I have some concern in the change?" </said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"You are mistaken,"</said> she cries, hastily—the idea that pity for her
                    miserable appearance has brought him back to her flashing gallingly across her mind. <said
                        who="#ecraven">"I was very fond of you—<hi rend="i">very;</hi> it was a great grief to me when
                        you threw me away from you; but I could have done without you, if—if—I had not lost my
                        boy."</said></p>
                <p>She turns away, to hide her quivering lips and swelling tears: it is so seldom that she speaks of her
                    dead, that the mere naming of him seems to make his loss the clearer.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#sjgerard">Gerard</persName>'s face falls a little. <said who="#sjgerard">"Could
                        you?"</said> he says, simply and sadly. <said who="#sjgerard">"No doubt! I was unreasonable to

                <p>They walk on in silence side by side. It is beginning to rain, heavy drops ushering in a winter
                    storm. The deer-barn is near—the deer-barn, with steep red roof, lichen-painted, standing on a
                    little rise, among a company of ancient hornbeams, whose twisted trunks lean this way and that. For
                    the last twenty years, every young lady that has come to stay at the hall has sketched the
                    deer-barn.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"This is not fit weather for you to be out in,"</said>
                    <persName corresp="#sjgerard">Gerard</persName> says, solicitously glancing at his companion's

                <p>Having reached it, <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> stands watching Heaven's quick
                    large tears falling heavy on Earth's chill breast; <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName>
                    walks up and down on the rough earth-floor, buried in thought. At length, rousing himself, he
                    approaches <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>, and speaks, calmly at first, but with
                    increasing vehemence as he proceeds:</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"<persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>, I have been thinking what a
                        short section of my life, counting by days and weeks, the time that I have known you forms; that
                        month at Felton, when we had scarcely eyes or ears for any one but each other, and this month
                        here, when we have hardly exchanged two words. I suppose I know very little about you, <hi
                            rend="i">really; </hi> you may be a very bad worthless girl, for all I know to the contrary.
                        God knows I have not had much reason to think you a very good one; and yet, good or bad—well, as
                        you say, and as I have no reason to doubt, that you can get on without me—I cannot, for the life
                        of me, bear any longer the dragging of the endless empty days without you. <persName
                            corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>!"</said> he says, with passionate hunger in his eyes,
                        <said who="#sjgerard"> "I <hi rend="i">want</hi> you! I <hi rend="i">must</hi> have you for my

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Have you forgotten,"</said> she asks, with a melancholy smile, <said
                        who="#ecraven">"the night when you told me that you would never forgive <pb n="423"
                            xml:id="VAB7385-427"/> me, either in this world or the next? What have I done since to make
                        you change your mind? I am no different to what I was then—unless, perhaps, I may be a little
                        wickeder; I have been most unhappy, and adversity makes one wicked."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"I suppose I have lost my senses,"</said> he answers, with excitement; <said
                        who="#sjgerard">"but it seems to me now that, even were you to deceive me again, as you did at
                        Felton—if you were to cheat me, and tell me falsehoods with the same baby-innocent face that you
                        did there—that even then I should not repent of my bargain. Of two evils it would be the least;
                        it would be better than never to have possessed you at all. Only, child, one thing I beg of
                        you,"</said> he continues, with reproachful entreaty: <said who="#ecraven">"if you mean to trick
                        me a second time, don't let me find it out for a little while! Let me be happy for a year—a

                <p>Her eyes rest on the ground, and a painful red spreads on either cheek. Despite the honest yearning
                    love that vibrates along his voice, she cannot cast out from her heart that galling suspicion that
                    has stolen there.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"You are very good,"</said> she makes answer, in a constrained voice; <said
                        who="#sjgerard">"and it is very generous of you trying to hide your real motive; but I can see
                        it: it is <hi rend="i">pity !</hi> You look at me, and think, 'She was a pretty girl once, and
                        now she has grown old and thin and plain, and it is all for love of me! 'Yes, it is pity!"
                    </said></p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"You are right,"</said> he answers, earnestly; <said who="#sjgerard"> "it is

                <p>She raises her eyes slowly, and fixes them searchingly on his eager flushing face; and, looking, can
                    doubt no longer.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"If I was over-harsh to you that night at Felton,"</said> he continues,
                    rapidly, <said who="#sjgerard">"and I am willing now to own that I was—for, after all, it was not
                        against me that you had most <pb n="424" xml:id="VAB7385-428"/> greatly sinned—I have, at all
                        events, paid heavily enough for it. What do you suppose I have suffered during the last month,
                        watching you day by day wearing out your young life in a cold servile drudgery—hearing you
                        strain your poor little tired voice in the interminable readings to that insatiable old man!

                <p>At that she laughs a little, but shakes her head.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Why do you shake your head?" </said> he asks, manlike, pursuing the hotlier
                    the more she seems to hold back. <said who="#sjgerard">"Is it,"</said> he says (a heavy fear
                    quickening his pulses, and making his voice come thick and harsh), <said who="#sjgerard"> "that you
                        want to tell me by signs, what you dare not tell me in words to my face, that the old love is
                            <hi rend="i">dead</hi>, killed by my hard words that miserable night at Felton Oh, love! it
                        must have been but a weakly thing, if a few rough words could kill it."</said></p>
                <p>She does not answer.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"You <hi rend="i">did</hi> love me once, <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                            >Esther</persName>,"</said> he continues, vehemently; <said who="#sjgerard">"I know you did!
                        I knew it then, only, in my blind rage, I affected to disbelieve it. You <hi rend="i">must</hi>
                        have loved me, when you, who had always been so shy, so reserved, so maidenly to me, of your own
                        accord—do you recollect, sweet?—held out your arms to me, and flung yourself upon my breast. God
                        only knows how hard it was for me to put you away!"</said></p>
                <p>At the recollection his speech calls up, her face is stirred with a convulsive emotion; but still she
                    holds her peace.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"<persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>, speak!—and yet, perhaps, when
                        you have spoken, I shall wish that you had kept silence. Say anything you will, do anything you
                        will, only don't kill me by telling me that so sweet a thing can be <hi rend="i">dead!</hi>"
                    </said></p>
                <p>She lifts her heavy eyes to him, and in them is the <pb n="425" xml:id="VAB7385-429"/> look of a
                    hunted animal. <said who="#ecraven">"Why do you torment me with these questions? "</said> she asks,
                    passionately. <said who="#ecraven">"If my love for you is dead, you ought to be thankful; for, while
                        it was alive, it brought nothing but misery to either of us."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"If you think so, it must indeed be dead,"</said> he answers, deeply
                    wounded.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Why will you insist on driving me into a corner?"</said> she asks, with the
                    accent of a person rendered irritable by pain. <said who="#ecraven">"Why will you force me to make
                        admissions that I don't want to make? What is the good of my owning that I love you still, when

                <p>
                    <said who="#sjgerard">"<hi rend="i">Never to marry me!</hi>"</said> he repeats; unable, in his
                    immense surprise, to do more than say her own words after her. A man is always overwhelmed with
                    astonishment at the idea of any woman not being overjoyed to espouse him.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Never to marry you!"</said> she reiterates, steadily. <said who="#ecraven">"I
                        was a bad-enough match for you before—without fortune, position, or connexion; people would have
                        pitied you then for being drawn into such a marriage; but now—"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"But now, what?"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"But now that I am a <hi rend="i">companion</hi>,"</said> she continues, with a
                    bitter pride—<said who="#ecraven">"an anomalous animal, just two shades higher than the lady's-maid
                        in my own estimation, and probably not that in any one else's—a companion, too, of whom people
                        can say the things that <persName corresp="#cblessington">Miss Blessington</persName> will say

                <p><said>"No, not that."</said></p>

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"I forget every word she uttered except three."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"And what were they?"</said></p>

                        together—I have never felt anything but the profoundest, coldest indifference?" </said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"I meant no insult,"</said> she replies, apologetically: <said who="#ecraven">"I

                <p>Under this severe snub, <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName> remains silent.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Is it,"</said> he continues, presently, his indignation being a little cooled,

                            <persName corresp="#jblessington">Blessington</persName>'s drudge. Child! have you no pity
                        for yourself?"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"None whatever,"</said> she answers, with emotion. <said who="#ecraven">"I am
                        not in the least sorry for myself; I richly deserve everything that is come to me. As long as I
                        am unhappy myself, I can better bear the recollection of my vile conduct to the best and
                        loyalest lover ever any woman had; if I began to be happy, I think my remorse would kill
                        me."</said></p>
                <p>He drops her hand suddenly, with a gesture of anger.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"I have been sacrificed to him once already,"</said> he says, fiercely; <said

                <p>She raises her rejected hand and its fellow deprecatingly towards him. <said who="#ecraven">"Don't be
                        angry with me,"</said> she cries, pleadingly; <pb n="428" xml:id="VAB7385-432"/>
                    <said who="#ecraven">"this has nothing to say to him; the reason why I will not marry you is that I

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"That is my concern, I imagine,"</said> he answers, stiffly.</p>

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Never!"</said> he replies, emphatically; and with that, she standing nigh, and
                    the temptation being mighty, he flings his arms <hi rend="i"><foreign xml:lang="fr">sans

                <p>She lifts, with infinite difficulty, eyes in which pride and shy passion are fighting a duel to the

                <p>She gives no verbal answer; but, with head shame-drooped, tries, with trembling hands, to push away

                <p>He turns away, with hands clenched and lips bitten, in the endeavour to be master of his useless

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"But I will not be sent,"</said> he cries fiercely, giving the reins to his

                <p>She makes no rejoinder, but, slipping from his side out into the wild wintry rain, flies across the

                    mind's eye. She has been telling herself that she was over-hasty in the relinquishment of them—has

                    drawing nearer to the bed, and speaking with an accent half-shocked, half-pleased; for, in a
                    servant's eyes, the next best thing to a death in the house is a serious illness. <said

                <p>Ten o'clock! The old couple are trundled off to their separate apartments: and <persName

                        >St. John</persName> a cold <said who="#cblessington">"good-night,"</said> sails, candle in
                    hand, up the grand staircase, to that sleep that never fails to come at her calm bidding. <persName
                        corresp="#sjgerard">Gerard</persName> foregoes his evening pipe, because the smoking-room does
                    not look to the front. In painful unrest, he unfastens the shutters of one of the saloon-windows,
                    and, raising the stiff and seldom-opened sash, leans out, looking and listening-looking at the
                    maiden moon that rides, pale and proud, while black ruffian clouds chase each other to overtake her.
                        <persName corresp="#mrbrand">Mr. Brand</persName> is out, apparently; for half-past ten has been
                    struck, in different tones—bass and treble, deep and squeaky—by half-a-dozen different clocks, and
                    still he has not arrived. At length, to the watcher's strained ear, comes the sound of wheels
                    descending the steep pitch, from Blessington village; then a brougham's lamps gleam, issuing from
                    between the rhododendron banks, and roll, like two angry eyes, to the door. In his feverish anxiety,
                    and impatience at the long tarrying of the sleepy footman, <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St.
                        John</persName> himself admits the doctor; and, following him at a little distance, as he is
                    ushered <pb n="436" xml:id="VAB7385-440"/> upstairs, sits down in his own bedroom, with the door
                    wide open, ready to pounce out upon the small Æsculapius, as he passes along the gallery at his
                    departure, and learn his verdict.</p>
                <p>The visit is rather a long one; to <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName>, sitting still
                    in his idle impatient misery, it seems as though the sound of <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Esther</persName>'s opening door would never come; but never is a long day. At length the
                    welcome sound is heard; and the young man, precipitating himself into the passage, comes face to
                    face with a small elderly gentleman, shiveringly taking his way down the unwarmed ghostly old
                    corridors.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Is it a serious case?"</said> he asks, abruptly, framing the simple words as
                    they rise from his full heart.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#mrbrand">Mr. Brand</persName> stares, surprised, at his questioner's blanched
                    face. He had imagined that his patient was a little friendless orphan companion, whose life or
                    death—save as a mere matter of compassion—were subjects of almost equal indifference to the people
                    under whose roof she lies, panting out her young life.</p>
                <p><said who="#mrbrand">"<hi rend="i">Serious?</hi> Well—oh! I assure you there is no cause for alarm,
                        my dear sir,"</said> he says, imagining that he has got the key to the mystery; <said
                        who="#mrbrand">"it is nothing infectious, I assure you—nothing whatever!"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"That is not what I asked,"</said> rejoins <persName corresp="#sjgerard"
                        >Gerard</persName>, bluntly. <said who="#sjgerard">"I don't care whether it is infectious or

                <p><said who="#mrbrand">"Are you any relation of the young lady, may I ask?—brother, perhaps?" </said>
                    inquires the little doctor, peering inquisitively, though under difficulties—for the abundant wind
                    is playing rude tricks with the flame of his candle—into <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St.
                        John</persName>'s sad brown face.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"No—none."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#mrbrand">"Well, then, to be candid with you, it <hi rend="i">does</hi> look rather
                        serious,"</said> he answers, with the careless deliberate calmnesa which those whose half-life
                    is spelt in pronouncing death- <pb n="437" xml:id="VAB7385-441"/> warrants seem insensibly to
                    acquire : <said who="#mrbrand">"a sharp attack of inflammation of the lungs, brought on by neglect

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"I know nothing about her family,"</said> replies the other, gloomily. He has
                    no reason, beyond the probability of the thing, for supposing that she had ever had a father or
                    mother, much less a grandfather or grandmother. <persName corresp="#mrbrand">Mr. Brand</persName>
                    retires, completely mystified; and <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName>, re-entering
                    his room, throws himself into an arm-chair, and, covering his face with his hands, sends up violent
                    voiceless prayers for the young life that is exchanging the first passes with that skilfulest of
                    fencers, whom the nations have christened "Death!" In all his rough godless life he has had small
                    faith in the efficacy of prayer; but, on the bare chance of there being some good in it, he prays
                    wordlessly in his stricken heart for her.</p>
                <p>Before they have done with him, the inmates of Blessington Hall have grown very familiar with
                        <persName corresp="#mrbrand">Dr. Brand</persName>'s face night and morning, night and morning,
                    coming and going, coming and going, through many days; for the adversary with whom the child is
                    wrestling has thrown many a better and stouter than she—and the battle is bitter. It is of little
                    use now that she hate the shadowing ginger curtains of the vast old wooden four-poster; there must
                    she lie, through all the weary twenty-four hours, in paroxysms of acutest pain, in fits of utter
                    breathlessness, in agonies of thirst. Grief for <persName corresp="#jcraven">Jack</persName>, love
                    for <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName>, shamed concern at <persName
                        corresp="#cblessington">Miss Blessington</persName>'s damaging story and insulting words, are
                    all swallowed up in the consuming craving for something to wet her parched lips, to cool her dry
                    throat— something to drink! something to drink! By-and-by, with the pain, she becomes
                    light-headed—wanders a little— <pb n="438" xml:id="VAB7385-442"/>
                    <quote>"babbles of green fields;"</quote> babbles to the uninterested ears of the sleepy tired
                    nurse, of the twisted seat under the old cherry-tree, of the tea-roses up the kitchen-garden walk,
                    of the yellow chickens in the rickyard. Then her delirium grows wilder: the green flabby Cupids on
                    the walls come down out of the tapestry, and make at her. One, that is riding on a lion and blowing
                    a horn, with fat cheeks puffed out, comes riding at her—riding up the bed-quilt, riding over her.
                    Then the black and gold cocks on the old japan-chest, that, with neck-feathers ruffled, and heads
                    lowered, stand ever, in act to fight, change their attitude: come pecking, pecking at her—pecking at
                    her eyes; and she, with terrified hands stretched out, fights at them—thrusts them away.</p>
                <quote><l rend="ti-3">"And thrice the double twilights rose and fell,</l>

                <p>And it comes to pass, that there falls a day when these sick fancies pass—when the pain and
                    breathlessness pass—and when <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> lies in utter
                    exhaustion, weak as a day-old babe, whiter than any Annunciation lily, between her sheets. Eyes and
                    ears and power of touch are still hers: but it seems as though all objects of sensation, of sight
                    and sound and touch, reach her only through a thick blanket. She can see, as if at an immense
                    distance off, shrouded in mist, the faces of doctor and nurse as they lean over her, and then,
                    turning away, whisper together. She cannot hear what they say; she has no wish to hear—she has no
                    wish for anything; only she lies, staring, with great eyes, straight before her at the bed-hangings,
                    at the ceiling, at the little countless pigeon-holes in her toilet-table. One of the windows is
                    open; and heaven's sweet breath circulates fresh and slow through the quiet room.</p>
                <p>It is Sunday; the village people are clustering about the <pb n="439" xml:id="VAB7385-443"/>
                    church-door; the violets, like blue eyes that have slept through winter's night, are opening under
                    the churchyard wall. The bells are ringing; now, loud and clear—<sound>" ding-dong bell! ding-dong
                        bell!"</sound> almost as if they were being rung in the still chamber itself—they come; now,
                    faint and far; the wind has caught the sound in his rough hand, and carried it otherwhither. Whether
                    they ring loud or faint, whether they ring or ring not at all, she has no care; she has no care for
                    anything. She is very weary: it seems as if there were but a faint life-spark left in her; she can
                    scarce lift her hand to her head. Now and then they raise her up, and, without asking her consent,
                    pour brandy and beef-tea down her reluctant throat. She is so tired! Oh! why cannot they leave her
                    alone! The slow hours roll themselves round; the people have gone into church, and have come out
                    again.</p>

                <p>Mr. Winter is the meek M.A., whose voice the old squire drowns.</p>

                <p>L<hi rend="sc">IFELESS</hi>! Yes! But there are two kinds of lifelessness : one from which there is
                    no back-coming—one from which there is. <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName>'s is the
                    latter. Although a member of that fraternity whose province it is to kill and to make alive has
                    sapiently said of her, <said who="#mrbrand">"She will die!—she has not a week to live!"</said>
                    Mother Nature has made answer, "She shall <hi rend="i">not</hi> die; I will save her alive! She has
                    yet many years." And <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> lives. For many days, it is hard
                    to predicate of her whether she be dead or alive; so faintly does the wave of life heave to and fro
                    in her breast—so lowly does life's candle burn. But though the candle burn low, it is not blown out.
                    By-and-bye strength gathers itself again, and comes back to pulse and vein and limb.</p>
                <p>At seventeen life holds us so fast in his embrace that he will hardly let us go. To the sick child
                    there come sweet sleeps; there comes a desire for food—a pleasure in the dusty sunbeam streaming
                    through the window—in the mote <pb n="444" xml:id="VAB7385-448"/> playing up and down on ceiling and
                    wall. I marvel will the bliss of spirits at the Resurrection dawn, feeling the clothing of pure new
                    bodies, surpass the delight that attends the renewal of the old body at the uprising from a great
                    sickness? The blanket that hung between <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> and all
                    objects of sensation is withdrawn: full consciousness returns, and remembrance; and in their
                    company, untold shame—shame at not having died! The celandine's greenish buds are unclosing into
                    little brazen wide-awake flowers in the hedge-banks: the crocuses in the garden-borders hold up
                    their gold chalices to catch the gentle February rain and the mild February sunbeams; in the
                    wood-hollows the mercury—spring's earliest herald—flourishes, thick and frequent, its stout green
                    shoots. About the meadows, small gawky lambs make a feeble <sound>"ba-a-a-ing."</sound> It is
                    drawing towards sundown. The window is open; and near it, on a beech bough, a thrush sits, singing a
                    loud sweet even-song.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther</persName> has been fully dressed for the first time, and has
                    been moved into an adjoining dressing-room. In the small change of scene, there is, to her, intense
                    delight—delight even in the changed pattern on the walls, in the different shape of the chairs—even
                    in the brass handles of the old oak chest of drawers. Every power seems new and fresh—every
                    sensation exquisitely keen; in every exercise of sight and sound and touch there is conscious joy.
                    She has been amusing herself making little tests of her strength. She lifts a book that lies on the
                    table beside her; it is small and light, but to her it seems over-heavy; she has to take two hands
                    to it. She makes a pilgrimage from her arm-chair to the window—she has to catch at the wall, at the
                    furniture, for support; but she gets there at last, and, sitting down on the window-seat, looks out
                    at the quiet sky, blackened with home-coming rooks—at the pool made flame-red by the westering
                    sun—at the peeping roof of the <pb n="445" xml:id="VAB7385-449"/> distant deer-barn. That little bit
                    of roof brings a flood of recollections to her, and first and foremost amongst them stands <persName
                        corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName> and her last interview with him. Although she is quite
                    alone, a torrent of red invades cheeks and throat and brow, even to the roots of her hair. <said
                        who="#ecraven">" <hi rend="i">I sent for him</hi>,"</said> she says to herself, with a sort of
                    gasp; <said who="#ecraven">" <hi rend="i">I asked him to kiss me</hi>, and <hi>I did not die!</hi>
                        How horrible! I must never see him again."</said> Then she falls to thinking about him: whether
                    he is still in the house? whether he has made up his differences with <persName
                        corresp="#cblessington">Miss Blessington</persName>? whether he is very joyful at her own
                    recovery? whether he is not penetrated with the ridiculousness of her impressive leave-taking,
                    which, after all—oh bathos!—was no leave-taking at all? <said who="#ecraven">"He must never hear me
                        mentioned again,"</said> she says, twisting her hands nervously together. <said who="#ecraven"
                        >"Perhaps he will forget it in time; perhaps he will not tell any one about it. How soon shall I

                <p>Aye, whither, <persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName>? There are but two alternatives for
                    her—the Union and Plas Berwyn. She must swallow her pride, and return to the Brandons: to the long
                    prayers; to the half-past six tea and bread and scrape; to the three bits of bacon at breakfast; and
                    to the perusal of the <hi rend="i">Record</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Rock</hi>: she must induce

                <p><persName corresp="#ecraven">Miss Craven</persName> looks rather small, and excessively childish,
                    sunk in her huge elbow-chair; a white wrapper envelopes her figure; her hair, which she has not
                    taken the trouble to dress properly, is twisted up in the loosest, unfashionablest, sweetest great
                    knot at the back of her neck; while a cherry-coloured ribbon coquettishly snoods her noble small
                    head: the innocentest, freshest, shyest rosebud-face, and the liquidest southern eyes, complete the
                    picture. <persName corresp="#sjgerard">St. John</persName> apparently treads hard upon the heels of
                    the messenger, for, before permission is well accorded him, he is in his mistress's presence. Upon
                    his brown face is untold gladness—in his eyes enormous love; and in them lurks also a look of
                    half-malicious, half-tender mirth. She rises, and then sits down again, in unutterable confusion;
                    and at length holds out her hand with distant diffidence to him, while as intense a blush as ever
                    made mortal woman call upon the hills to cover her, bathes every inch of her that is visible. Her
                    cheeks feel like gigantic red globes; over <pb n="447" xml:id="VAB7385-451"/> which her eyes have
                    difficulty in looking. <hi rend="i">His</hi> eyes, laughing, pitiless, yet impassioned, refuse to

                <p>She turns away her head, and covers her face with both hands; but, in the interstices between her

                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Oh, don't—don't be so cruel!" </said> she murmurs, in a stifled voice.</p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"The truth can never be cruel!" </said> he says quietly, smiling still; and so
                    kneels down on the floor beside her.</p>

                    hands.</p>
                <p>He puts up his, and tries to draw away the screen from her shamed discomfited face, saying, <said

                    hands, and her face lies bare, unshaded—dyed with an agony of shame—clothed with great beauty—under
                    the hungry tenderness of his happy eyes.</p>

                        after all,"</said> she says, in torments of confusion, yet unable to restrain an uneasy laugh.
                        <said who="#ecraven">"It is <hi rend="i">too</hi> disgraceful! I shall never get over it! <hi

                    exquisite pleasure of teasing her.</p>
                <p>She turns from him with a petulant movement of head and shoulder. <said who="#ecraven">"Why don't you
                        go?" </said> she cries, the angry tears flashing into her eyes; <said who="#ecraven">"I hate the

                <p>At that he grows grave. <said who="#sjgerard">"<persName corresp="#ecraven">Essie</persName>,"</said>
                    he says, slipping his arms round her as she sits, shrinking away from him in the deep chintz chair,
                        <said who="#sjgerard">"in that awful moment, when you thought—and God knows I thought so
                        too—that we were saying 'goodbye' to one another for <hi rend="i">always</hi>, the barriers that
                        your wretched false pride had built up between us were knocked down; try as you may, you can
                        never build them up again."</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"I knocked down plenty of barriers, I'm aware,"</said> she answers, ruefully.
                        <said who="#ecraven">"You need not remind me of that!" </said></p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Never to be built up again any more—never any more!"</said> he says, his mirth
                    swallowed up in great solemn joy.</p>
                <p>She has fallen forwards into his embrace; he holds her little trembling form against his heart—a
                    posture to which she submits, chiefly because it affords her an opportunity of hiding her face upon
                    his shoulder.</p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Never any more!"</said> she repeats, mechanically, and then there is silence,
                    save for the thrush, that trills ever his high tender lay. Presently <persName corresp="#ecraven"
                        >Essie</persName> stirs, and whispers, with uneasiness, <said who="#ecraven">"<persName

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Well?"</said></p>

                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"What! you contemplate our having little differences of opinion?"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#ecraven">"Of course,"</said> she answers, laughing; <said who="#ecraven">"when two such
                        ill-tempered people come together, how can it be otherwise?"</said></p>
                <p><said who="#sjgerard">"Quarrel or no quarrel,"</said> he cries, passionately kissing her sweet shy
                    lips, as one that can never be satiated with their tender warmth, <said who="#sjgerard">"we are
                        together now, for bad and good, for fair weather and foul, till death us do part! Say it after
                        me, <persName corresp="#ecraven">Essie</persName>; don't let ours be a one-sided

                <p>And <persName corresp="#ecraven">Essie</persName>, obedient, murmurs after him, <said who="#ecraven"

                <ab rend="center" type="typography">* * * * *</ab>

                <p>And so it comes to pass that in the sweet spring weather, when the ground is a carpet of strewn
                    cherry-blooms, when the cows stand knee-deep in buttercups, and the brake-fern is uncrumpling its
                    tender fronds, the church-bells ring out, and they two are wed.</p>
                <p>And the sun, that shines down on the bravery of the wedding pomp, as bride and groom pace by, shines
                    also hotlier, with a more brazen sickly glare, on a soldier's grave, over which, three days ago, his
                    comrades fired the parting volley on Bermuda's sultry shore.</p>
                <p>The name of the soldier to whom Heaven has granted his discharge is <persName corresp="#rbrandon"
                        >Robert Brandon</persName>. <persName corresp="#ecraven">Esther Gerard</persName> may spare her
                    remorse now; treachery of hers can wound that loyal heart, on which the worm feeds sweetly, never
                    more! Not unknowing of the good fortune of the woman he had so madly, miserably, nobly loved, has he
                    passed away. In his poor schoolboy scrawl he had written her a little simple, badly-worded note,
                    bidding, "God bless and speed her on her way!" The tears had fallen hot and thick upon the paper;
                        <pb n="450" xml:id="VAB7385-454"/> but he had wiped them off, and she had never guessed them. He
                    has hoarded his scant pay, has denied himself many of the small comforts that to his
                    brother-officers are bare necessaries of life, that he may send her a wedding-gift befitting
                        <persName corresp="#sjgerard">Gerard</persName>'s bride. And he had gone about his wonted ways
                    with no moping martyr's airs, unshaken in his simple creed that, since God wills it, all must be for
                    the best. His honest laugh, if it come seldomer than it used, yet is none the less hearty and genial
                    when it does come. And then, that pestilence which, at stated seasons, never forgetting its
                    appointed periods, visits that tropic clime, comes and lays its heavy hand on the shoulder of many a
                    fair-haired youth; and, among the first, upon the stalwart shoulder of <persName corresp="#rbrandon"
                        >Robert Brandon</persName>. And he, with no life-hating madness, with no quarrel against fate,
                    yet not all unwilling, having stoutly fought life's hard battle:</p>
