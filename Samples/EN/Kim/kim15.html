<p>
Two hundred miles north of Chini, on the blue shade of Ladahk, lies
Yankling Sahib, a merry-minded man, spy-glassing wrathfully across the
ridges for some sign of his pet tracker &#8212; a man from Ao-chung. But that
renegade, with a new Mannlicher rifle and two hundred cartridges, is
elsewhere, shooting musk-deer for the market, and Yankling Sahib will
learn next season how very ill he has been.</p>
<p>
Up the valleys of Bushahr &#8212; the far-beholding eagles of the Himalayas
swerve at his new blue-and-white gored umbrella &#8212; hurries a Bengali,
once fat and well-looking, now lean and weather-worn. He has received
the thanks of two foreigners of distinction, whom he has piloted not
unskilfully to Mashobra tunnel which leads to the great and gay capital
of India. It was not his fault that, blanketed by wet mists, he
conveyed them past the telegraph station and European colony of
Kotgarh. It was not his fault, but that of the Gods, of whom he
discoursed so engagingly, that he led them into the borders of Nahan,
where the Rajah of that state mistook them for deserting British
soldiery. Hurree Babu explained the greatness and glory, in their own
country, of his companions, till the drowsy kinglet smiled. He
explained it to every one who asked &#8212; many times &#8212; aloud &#8212; variously.
He begged food, arranged accommodation, proved a skilful leech for an
injury of the groin &#8212; such a blow as one may receive rolling down a
rock-covered hillside in the dark &#8212;and in all things indispensable. The
reason of his friendliness did him credit. With millions of
fellowserfs, he had learned to look upon Russia as the great deliverer
from the North. He was a fearful man. He had been afraid that he could
not save his illustrious employers from the anger of an excited
peasantry. He himself would just as lief hit a holy man as not, but . .
. He was deeply grateful and sincerely rejoiced that he had done his
&#8216;little possible towards bringing their venture to &#8212; barring the lost
baggage a successful issue. He had forgotten the blows; denied that
any. blows had been dealt that unseemly first night under the pines. He
asked neither pension nor retaining fee, but, if they deemed him
worthy, would they write him a testimonial? It might be useful to him
later, if other, their friends, came over the passes. He begged them to
remember him in their future greatnesses, for he &#8216;opined subtly&#8217; that
he, even he, Mohendro Lal Putt, M.A. of Calcutta, had &#8216;done the state
some service.&#8217;</p>
<p>
They gave him a certificate praising his courtesy, helpfulness, and
unerring skill as a guide. He put it in his waist-belt and sobbed with
emotion; they had endured so many dangers together. He led them at high
noon along crowded Simla Mall to the Alliance Bank of Simla where they
wished to establish their identity. Thence he vanished like a
dawn-cloud on Jakko.</p>
<p>

Behold him, too fine drawn to sweat, too pressed to vaunt the drugs in
his little brass-bound box, ascending Shamlegh slope, a just man made
perfect. Watch him, all Babu-dom laid aside, smoking at noon on a cot,
while a woman with turquoise-studded headgear points south-easterly
across the bare grass. Litters, she says, do not travel as fast as
single men, but his birds should now be in the plains. The Holy Man
would not stay though she pressed him. The Babu groans ponderously,
girds up his huge loins, and is off again. He does not care to travel
after dusk; but his days&#8217; marches &#8212; there is none to enter them in a
book &#8212; would astonish folk who laugh at his race. Kindly villages,
remembering the Dacca drug-vendor of two months ago, give him shelter
against evil spirits of the wood. He dreams of Bengali gods, University
text-books of his education, and the Royal Society, London, England.
Next dawn the bobbing blue-and-white umbrella goes forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
On the edge of the Doon, Mussoorie well behind them and the plains laid
out in golden dusk before, rests a worn litter in which &#8212; all the hills
know it &#8212;lies a sick lama who seeks a River for his healing. Villages
have almost come to blows for the honour of bearing it, and not only
has the lama given them blessings, but his disciple good money &#8212; full
one-third Sahib&#8217;s prices. Twelve miles a day has the <i>dooli </i>travelled,
as the greasy, rubbed pole-ends show, and by roads that few Sahibs use.
Over the Nilang Pass in storm when the driven snow-dust filled every
fold of the impassive lama&#8217;s drapery; between the black horns of Raieng
&#8212; where they heard the whistle of the wild goats through the clouds;
pitching and strained on the shale below; hard held between shoulder
and clenched jaw when they rounded the hideous curves of the Cut Road
above Bhagirati; swinging and creaking to the steady jog-trot of the
descent into the Valley of the Waters; pressed along the steamy levels
of that locked valley; up, up and out again, to meet the roaring gusts
off Kedarnath; set down of middays in the dun-gloom of kindly
oak-forests; passed from village to village in dawn-chill, when even
devotees may be forgiven for swearing at impatient holy men; or by
torchlight, when the least fearful think of ghosts, the <i>dooli
</i>has reached her last stage. The little hillfolk sweat
in the modified heat of the lower Sewaliks, and gather round the
priests for their blessing and their wage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Ye have acquired merit,&#8217; says the lama. &#8216;Merit greater than your
knowing. And ye will return to the hills,&#8217; he sighs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

&#8216;Surely. The high hills as soon as may be.&#8217; The bearer rubs his
shoulder, drinks water, spits it out again, and readjusts his grass
sandal. Kim &#8212; his face is drawn and tired &#8212; pays very small silver from
his belt, heaves out the food-bag, sticks an oilskin packet &#8212; they are
holy writings &#8212; into his bosom, and helps the lama to his feet. The
peace has come again into the old man&#8217;s eyes, and he does not look for
the hills to fall down and crush him as he did that terrible night when
they were delayed by the flooded river.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The hillmen pick up the <i>dooli </i>and swing out of
sight between the scrub clumps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The lama raises a hand to the rampart of the Himalayas. &#8216;Not with you,
O blessed among all hills, fell the Arrow of Our Lord! And never shall
I breathe your air again.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;But thou art ten times the stronger man in this good air,&#8217; says Kim,
for to his wearied soul appeal the fat, well-cropped, kindly plains.
&#8216;Here, or hereabouts, fell the arrow. We will go very softly, perhaps a
koss a day, for the Search is sure. But the bag weighs heavy.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Ay, our Search is sure. I have come out of great temptation.&#8217;</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
*
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;
* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;
</div><p>
It was never more than a couple of miles a day now, and Kim&#8217;s shoulders
bore all the weight of it &#8212;the burden of an old man, the burden of the
heavy food-bag with the locked books, the load of the writings on his
heart, and the details of the daily routine. He begged in the dawn, set
blankets for the lama&#8217;s meditation, held the weary head on his lap
through the noonday heats, fanning away the flies till his wrist ached,
begged again in the evenings, and rubbed the lama&#8217;s feet, who rewarded
him with promise of Freedom &#8212; to-day, to-morrow, or, at furthest, the
next day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

&#8216;Never was such a <i>chela. </i>I doubt at times whether
Ananda more faithfully nursed our Lord. And thou art a Sahib? When I
was a man &#8212; a long time ago &#8212; I forgot that. Now I look upon thee
often, and every time I remember that thou art a Sahib. It is
strange.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Thou hast said there is neither black nor white. Why plague me with
this talk, Holy One? Let me rub the other foot. It vexes me. I am <i>not
</i>a Sahib. I am thy <i>chela, </i>and my
head is heavy on my shoulders.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

&#8216;Patience a little! We will reach Freedom together. Then thou and I,
upon the far bank of the River, will look back upon our lives as in the
hills we saw our day&#8217;s marches laid out behind us. Perhaps I was once a
Sahib.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Was never a Sahib like thee, I swear it.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;I am certain the Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House was in past
life a very wise Abbot. But even his spectacles do not make my eyes
see. There fall shadows when I would look steadily. No matter &#8212; we know
the tricks of the poor stupid carcass &#8212; shadow changing to another
shadow. I am bound by the illusion of time and apace. How far came we
to-day in the flesh?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

&#8216;Perhaps half a koss.&#8217; Three-quarters of a mile, and it was a weary
march.</p>
<p>
&#8216;Half a koss. Ha! I went ten thousand thousand in the spirit. How we
are all lapped and swathed and swaddled in these senseless things.&#8217; He
looked at his thin blue-veined hand that found the beads so heavy. <i>&#8216;Ultela,
</i>hast thou never a wish to leave me?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Kim thought of the oilskin packet and the books in the food-bag. If
some one duly authorised would only take delivery of them the Great
Game might play itself for aught he then cared. He was tired and hot in
his head, and a cough that came from the stomach worried him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;No,&#8217; he said almost sternly. &#8216;I am not a do or a snake to bite when I
have learned to love.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Thou art too tender for me.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Not that either. I have moved in one matter without consulting thee. I
have sent a message to the Kulu woman by that woman who gave us the
goat&#8217;s milk this morn, saying that thou wast a little feeble and would
need a litter. I beat myself in my mind that I did not do it when we
entered the Doon. We stay in this place till the litter
returns.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;I am content. She is a woman with a heart of gold, as thou sayest, but
a talker &#8212; something of a talker.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;She will not weary thee. I have looked to that also. Holy One, my
heart is very heavy for my many carelessnesses towards thee.&#8217; A catch
rose in his throat. &#8216;I have walked thee too far; I have not picked good
food always for thee; I have not considered the heat; I have talked to
people on the road and left thee alone. . - . I have &#8212; I have. . . <i>
Hai mail </i>But I love thee . .
. and it is all too late. . . . I was a child. . . . Oh why was I not a
man? . . .&#8216; Overcome by strain, fatigue, and the weight beyond his
years, Kim broke down and sobbed at the lama&#8217;s feet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;What a to do is here,&#8217; said the old man gently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Thou hast never stepped a hair&#8217;s breadth from the Way of Obedience.
Neglect me? Child &#8212; I have lived on thy strength as an old tree lives
on the lime of a new wall. Day by day, since Shamlegh Doun, I have
stolen strength from thee. <i>Therefore,
</i>not through any sin of thine, art thou weakened. It is
the body &#8212; the silly, stupid body &#8212; that speaks now. Not the assured
soul. Be comforted! Know the devils, at least, that thou fightest. They
are earthborn &#8212; children of illusion. We will go to the woman from
Kulu. She shall acquire merit in housing us, and specially in tending
me. Thou shalt run free till strength returns. I had forgotten the
stupid body. If there be any blame, I bear it. But we are too close to
the gates of deliverance to weigh blame. I could praise thee, but what
need? in a little &#8212; in a very little &#8212; we shall sit beyond all
needs.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
And so he petted and comforted Kim with wise saws and grave texts on
that little understood beast, our body, who, being but a delusion,
insists on posing as the soul, to the darkening of the Way, and the
immense multiplication of unnecessary devils.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Hai! hai! Let us talk of the woman from Kulu. Think you she will ask
another charm for her grandsons? When I was a young man, a very long
time ago, I was plagued with these vapours, and some others, and I went
to an abbot &#8212; a very holy man and a seeker after truth, though then I
knew it not. Sit up and listen, child of my soul! My tale was told.
Said he to me, &#8220;<i>Chela,
</i>know this. There are many lies in the world, and not a
few liars, but there are no liars like our bodies, except it be the
sensations of our bodies.&#8221; Considering this I was comforted, and of his
great favour he suffered me to drink tea in his presence. Suffer me now
to drink tea, for I am thirsty.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
With a laugh above his tears, Kim kissed the lama&#8217;s feet, and went
about tea-making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Thou leanest on me in the body, Holy One, but I lean on thee for all
other things. Dost thou know it?&#8217;</p>
<p>
&#8216;I have guessed maybe,&#8217; and the lama&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8216;We must change
that.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
So, when with scufflings and scrapings and a hot air of importance,
paddled up nothing less than the Sahiba&#8217;s pet palanquin sent twenty
miles, with that same grizzled old Oorya servant in charge, and when
they reached the disorderly order of the long white rambling house
behind Saharunpore, the lama took his own measures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Said the Sahiba cheerily from an upper window, after compliments: &#8216;What
is the good of an old woman&#8217;s advice to an old man? I told thee &#8212; I <i>told
</i>thee, Holy One, to keep an eye upon the <i>chela.
</i>How didst thou do it? Never answer me! <i>I </i>know.
He has been running among the women. Look at his eyes &#8212; hollow and
sunk! And the Betraying Line from the nose down. He has been sifted
out! Fie! Fie! And a priest, too!&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Kim looked up almost too weary to smile, shaking his head in
denial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Do not jest,&#8217; said the lama. &#8216;That time is done. We are here upon
great matters. A sickness of soul took me in the hills, and him a
sickness of the body. Since then I have lived upon his strength &#8212;
eating him.&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

&#8216;Children together &#8212; young and old,&#8217; she sniffed, but forbore to make
any new jokes. &#8216;May this present hospitality restore ye. Hold awhile
and I will come to gossip of the high good hills.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At evening time &#8212; her son-in-law was returned, so she did not need to
go on inspection round the farm &#8212; she won to the meat of the matter,
explained lowvoicedly by the lama. The two old heads nodded wisely
together. Kim had staggered to a room with a cot in it, and was dozing
soddenly. The lama had forbidden him to set blankets or get
food.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;I know &#8212; I know. Who but I?&#8217; she cackled. &#8216;We who go down to the
burning-ghats clutch at the hands of those coming up from the river of
life with full water-jars. Yes, brimming water-jars. I did the boy
wrong. He lent thee his strength? It is true that the old eat the young
daily. Stands now that we must restore him.&#8217;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Thou hast many times acquired merit.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>

&#8216;My </i>merit. What is it?
Old bag of bones making curries for men who do not ask &#8220;Who cooked
this?&#8221; Now if it were stored up for my grandson &#8212;&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;He that had the belly-pain?&#8217;</p>
<p>
&#8216;To think the Holy One remembers <i>that. </i>I must tell
his mother. It is most singular honour! &#8220;He that had the belly-pain&#8221; &#8212; straightway the
Holy One remembered. She will be proud.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;My
<i>chela </i>is to me as is a son to the
unenlightened.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Say grandson, rather. Mothers have not the wisdom of our years. If a
child cries they say tile heavens are falling. Now a grandmother is far
enough separated from the pain of bearing and the pleasure of giving
the breast to consider whether a cry is pure wickedness or the wind.
And since thou speakest once again of wind, when last the Holy One was
here, maybe I offended in pressing for charms.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Sister,&#8217; said the lama, using
that form of address a Buddhist monk may sometimes employ towards a
nun, &#8216;if charms comfort thee &#8212;&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;They are better than ten thousand <i>hakims.&#8217;</i><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
&#8216;I say, if they comfort thee, I who was Abbot of Such-zen, will make as
many as thou mayest desire. I have never seen thy face &#8212;&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;That even the monkeys who steal our loquats count for a gain. Hee!
hee!&#8217;</p>
<p>
&#8216;But as he who sleeps there said,&#8217; he nodded at the shut door of the
guest-chamber across the forecourt, &#8216;thou hast a heart of gold. . . And
he is in the spirit my very &#8220;grandson&#8221; to me.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

&#8216;Good! I am the Holy One&#8217;s cow,&#8217; this was pure Hinduism, but the lama
never heeded. &#8216;I am old. I have borne Sons in the body. Oh once I could
please men! Now I can cure them.&#8217; He heard her armlets tinkle as though
she bared arms for action. &#8216;I will take over the boy and dose him, and
stuff him, and make him all whole. Hai! hai! We old people know
something yet.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

Wherefore when Kim, aching in every bone, opened his eyes, and would go
to the cook-house to get his master&#8217;s food, he found strong coercion
about him, and a veiled old figure at the door, flanked by the grizzled
manservant, who told him precisely the very things that he was on no
account to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Thou must have &#8212; thou shalt have nothing. What? A locked box in which
to keep holy books? Oh, that is another matter. Heavens forbid I should
come between a priest and his prayers! It shall be brought, and thou
shalt keep the key.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
They pushed the coffer under his cot, and Kim shut away Mahbub&#8217;s
pistol, the oilskin packet of letters, and the locked books and
diaries, with a groan of relief. For some absurd reason their weight on
his shoulders was nothing to their weight on his poor mind. His neck
ached under it of nights.</p>
<p>

&#8216;Thine is a sickness uncommon in youth these days: for young folk have
given up tending their betters. The remedy is sleep, and certain
drugs,&#8217; said the Sahiba.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
She brewed drinks, in some mysterious Asiatic equivalent to the
still-room &#8212; drenches that smelt pestilently and tasted worse. She
stood over Kim till they went down and inquired exhaustively after they
had come up. She laid a taboo upon the forecourt, and enforced it by
means of an armed man. It is true he was seventy odd, that his
scabbarded sword ceased at the hilt; but he represented the authority
of the Sahiba, and loaded wains, chattering servants, calves, dogs,
hens, and the like, fetched a wide compass by those parts. Best of all,
when the body was cleared, she cut out from the mass of\poor relations
that crowded the back of the buildings &#8212; household dogs, we name them &#8212;
a cousin&#8217;s widow, skilled in what Europeans, who know very little about
it, call massage. And the two of them, laying him east and west, that
the mysterious earth-currents which thrill the clay of our bodies might
help and not hinder, took him to pieces all one long afternoon &#8212; bone
by bone, muscle by muscle, ligament by ligament, and lastly, nerve by
nerve. Kneaded to irresponsible pulp, half hypnotised by the perpetual
flick and readjustment of the uneasy <i>chudders </i>that
veiled their eyes, Kim slid ten thousand miles into slumber &#8212;
thirty-six hours of it &#8212; sleep that soaked like rain after drought.</p>
<p>
Then she fed him, and the house spun to her clamour. She caused fowls
to be slain; she sent for vegetables, and the sober, slow-thinking
gardener, nigh as old as she, sweated for it; she took spices, and
milk, and onion, with little fish from the brooks &#8212; anon limes for
sherbets, quails of the bit, then chicken livers upon a skewer, with
sliced ginger between.</p>
<p>
&#8216;I have seen something of this world,&#8217; she said over the crowded trays,
&#8216;and there are but two sorts of Women in it &#8212; those who take the
strength out of a man and those who put it back. Once I was that one,
and now I am this. Nay &#8212; do not play the priestling with me. Mine was
but a jest. If it does not hold good now, it will when thou takest the
road again. Cousin&#8217; &#8212; this to the poor
relation, never wearied of extolling her patroness&#8217;s charity &#8212; &#8216;he is
getting a bloom on the skin of a new-curried horse. Our work is like
polishing jewels to be thrown to a dance-girl &#8212; eh?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Kim sat up and smiled. The terrible weakness had dropped from him like
an old shoe. His tongue itched for free speech again, and but a week
back the lightest word clogged it like ashes. The pain in his neck (he
must have caught it from the lama) had gone with the heavy dengue-aches
and the evil taste in his mouth. The two old women, a little, but not
much more careful about their veils now, clucked as merrily as the hens
that had entered picking through the open door.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

&#8216;Where is my Holy One?&#8217; he demanded. </p>
<p>
&#8216;Hear him! Thy Holy One is
well,&#8217; she snapped
viciously. &#8216;Though that is none of <i>his </i>merit. Knew
I a charm to make him wise, I&#8217;d sell my jewels and buy it. To refuse
good food &#8212; that I cooked myself &#8212; and go roving into the fields for
two nights on an empty belly &#8212; and to tumble into a brook at the end of
it. Call you <i>that </i>holiness? Then, when he has
nearly broken what thou hast left of my heart with anxiety he tells me
that he has acquired merit. Oh how like are all men! No, that was not
it &#8212; he tells me that he is freed from all sin. <i>I </i>could
have told him that before he wetted himself all over. He is well now &#8212;
this happened a week ago &#8212; but burn me such holiness! A babe of three
would do better. Do not fret thyself for the Holy One. He keeps both
eyes on thee when he is not wading our brooks.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;I do not remember to have seen him. I remember that the days and
nights passed like bars of white and black, opening and shutting. I was
not sick, I was only tired.&#8217;</p>
<p>
&#8216;A lethargy that comes by right some few score years later. But it is
all done now.&#8217;</p>
<p>

&#8216;Maharanee,&#8217; Kim began, but led by the look in her eye, changed it to
the title of plain love &#8212;&#8217; Mother, I owe my life to thee. How shall I
make thanks? Ten thousand blessings upon thy house and &#8212;&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;The house be unblessed.&#8217; (It is impossible to give exactly the old
lady&#8217;s word.) &#8216;Thank the Gods as a priest if thou wilt, but thank me if
thou carest as a son. Heavens above! Have I shifted thee and lifted
thee and slapped and twisted thy ten toes to find texts flung at my
head? Somewhere a mother must have borne thee &#8212; to break her heart.
What used thou to her? Son?&#8217;</p>
<p>
&#8216;I had no mother, my mother,&#8217; said Kim. &#8216;She died, they tell me, when I
was young.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Hai mai! Then none can say I have robbed her of any right if, when
thou takest the road again and this house is but one of a thousand used
for shelter and forgotten, after an easy flung blessing. No matter. I
need no blessings, but &#8212; but &#8212;&#8217; She stamped her foot at the poor
relation: &#8216;Take up the trays to the house. What is the good of stale
food in the room, oh woman of ill-omen?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;I ha &#8212; have borne a son in my time too, but he died,&#8217; whimpered the
bowed sister figure behind the <i>chudder. </i>&#8216;Thou
knowest he died! I only waited for the order to take away the tray.&#8217;</p>
<p>
&#8216;It is I that am the woman of ill-omen,&#8217; cried the old lady penitently.
&#8216;We that go down to the <i>chattris </i>(the big
umbrellas above the burning-ghats where the priests take their last
dues), clutch hard at the bearers of the <i>chattis
</i>(water-jars &#8212; young folk full of the pride of life, she
meant, but the pun is clumsy). When one cannot dance in the festival
one must e&#8217;en look out of the window, and grandmothering takes all a
woman&#8217;s time. Thy master gives me all the charms I now desire for my
daughter&#8217;s eldest, by reason &#8212; is it? &#8212; that he is wholly free from
sin. The <i>hakim </i>is brought very low these days.
Tile goes about poisoning my servants for lack of their
betters.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;What
<i>hakim, </i>mother?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;That very Dacca man who gave me the pill which rent me in three
pieces. He cast up like a strayed camel a week ago, vowing that he and
thou had been blood-brothers together up Kulu way, and feigning great
anxiety for thy health. He was very thin and hungry, so I gave orders
to have him stuffed too &#8212;him and his anxiety.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;I would see him if he is here.&#8217;</p>
<p>
&#8216;He eats five times a day, and lances boils for the villagers to save
himself from an apoplexy. He is so full of anxiety for thy health that
he sticks to the cook-house door and stays himself with scraps. He will
keep. We shall never get rid of him.&#8217;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Send him here, mother,&#8217; &#8212; the twinkle returned to Kim&#8217;s eye for a
flash &#8212; &#8216; and I will try.&#8217;</p>
<p>
&#8216;I&#8217;ll send him, but to chase him off is an ill turn. At least he had
the sense to fish the Holy One out of the brook. Thus, as the Holy One
did <i>not </i>say, acquiring merit.&#8217;</p>
<p>
&#8216;He is a very wise <i>hakim. </i>Send him, mother.&#8217;</p>
<p>

&#8216;Priest praising priest, a miracle! If he is any friend of thine (ye
squabbled at your last meeting) I&#8217;ll hale him here with horse ropes and
&#8212; and give him a caste dinner afterwards, my son.&nbsp; . . Get up
and see the world! This lying abed is the mother of seventy devils . .
. my son! my son!&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
She trotted forth to raise a typhoon off the cook-house, and almost on
her shadow rolled in the Babu, robed as to the shoulders like a Roman
emperor, jowled like Titus, bare-headed, with new patent leather shoes,
in highest condition of fat, exuding joy and salutations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;By Jove, Mister O&#8217;Hara, but I <i>am </i>jolly glad to
see you. I will kindly shut the door. It is a pity you are sick. Are
you very sick?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;The papers &#8212; the papers from the <i>kilta. </i>The maps
and the <i>murasla!&#8217; </i>He held out the key impatiently:
for the present need on his soul was to get rid of the loot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;You are quite right. That is correct departmental view to take. You
have got everything?&#8217;</p>
<p>
&#8216;All that was handwritten in the <i>kilta</i> I took. The
rest I threw down the bill.&#8217; He could hear the key&#8217;s grate in the lock,
the sticky pull of the slow-rending oil-cloth, and a quick shuffling of
papers. He had been annoyed out of all reason by the knowledge that
they lay below him through the sick idle days &#8212; a burden
incommunicable. For that reason the blood tingled through his body,
when Hurree, skipping elephantinely, shook hands again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;This is fine! This is finest! Mister O&#8217;Hara! You have &#8212; ha! ha! &#8212;
swiped the whole bag of tricks &#8212; locks, stocks, and barrels. They told
me it was eight months&#8217; work gone up the spouts I By Jove, how they
beat me! . . .Look, here is the letter from Hilás!&#8217; Tie intoned a line
or two of court Persian, which is the language of authorised and
unauthorised diplomacy. &#8216;Mister Raja Sahib has just about put his foot
in the holes. He will have to explain offeecially how the deuce an&#8217; all
he is writing love-letters to the Czar. And they are very cunning maps
. . . and there is three or four Prime Ministers of these parts
implicated by correspondence. By Gad, Sar! The British Government will
change the succession in Hilás and Bunár, and nominate new
heirs to the throne. &#8220;Treason most base&#8221;. . .but you do not understand?
Eh?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Are they in thy hands?&#8217; said Kim. It was all he cared for.</p>
<p>
&#8216;Just you jolly well bet yourself they are.&#8217; He stowed the entire trove
about his body, as only Orientals can. &#8216;They are going up to the
office, too. The old lady thinks I am a permanent fixture here, but I
shall go away with these straight off &#8212; immediately. Mr. Lurgan wi1l be
proud man. You are offeecially subordinate to me, but I shall embody
your name in my verbal report. It is a pity we are not allowed written
reports. We Bengalis excel in the exact science.&#8217; He tossed back the
key and showed the box empty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Good. That is good. I was
very tired. My Holy One was sick, too. And did he fall into &#8212;&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Oah yess. I am his good friend, I tell you. He was behaving very
strange when I came down after you, and I thought perhaps he might have
the papers. I followed him on his meditations, and to discuss
ethnological points also. You see, I am verree small person here
nowadays, in comparison with all his charms. By Jove, O&#8217;Hara, do you
know, he is afflicted with infirmity of fits. Yess, I tell you.
Cataleptic, too, if not also epileptic. I found him in such a state
under a tree <i>in articulo mortem, </i>and he jumped up
and walked into a brook and he was nearly drowned but for me. I pulled
him out.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

&#8216;Because I was not there,&#8217; said Kim. &#8216;He might have died.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Yes, he might have died, but he is dry now, and asserts he has
undergone transfiguration.&#8217; The Babu tapped his forehead knowingly. &#8216;I
took notes of his statements for Royal Society &#8212; <i>in posse. </i>
You must make haste and be quite well and come back to Simla, and I
will tell you all my tale at Lurgan&#8217;s. It was splendid. The bottoms of
their trousers were
<i>quite </i>torn, and old Nahan Raja, he thought
they were European soldiers deserting.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;The Russians? How long were they with thee?&#8217;</p>
<p>
&#8216;One was a Frenchman. Oh, days and days and days! Now all the
bill-people believe all Russians are all beggars. By Jove! they had not
one damn thing that I did not get them. And I told the common people &#8212;
oah, <i>such </i>tales and anecdotes! I will tell you at
old Lurgan&#8217;s when you come up. We will have &#8212; all &#8212; a night out! It is
feather in both our caps! Yess, and they gave me a certificate. That is
creaming joke. You should have seen them at the Alliance Bank
identifying themselves. And thank Almighty God you got their papers so
well! You do not laugh very much, but you shall laugh when you are
well. Now I will go straight to the railway and get out. You shall have
all sorts of credits for your game. When do you come along? We are very
proud of you though you gave us great frights. And especially
Mahbub.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Ay, Mahbub. And where is he?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Selling horses in this
vicinity, of course.&#8217;</p>

<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><a name="kim10"><img src="Kim10.jpg" border="0" height="500" width="320"></a><br>
He crossed his hands on his lap and smiled, as a
man who has won Salvation for himself and his beloved.</div>
<p>

&#8216;Here! Why? Speak slowly. There is a thickness in my head
still.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The Babu looked shyly down his nose. &#8216;Well, you see, I am fearful man,
and I do not like responsibility. You were sick, you see, and I did not
know where deuce and all the papers were, and if so, how many. So when
I had come down here I slipped in private wire to Mahbub &#8212; he was at
Meerut for races &#8212; and I tell him how case stands. He comes up with his
men and he consorts with the lama, and then he calls me a fool, and is
very rude &#8212;&#8217;</p>
<p>
&#8216;But wherefore &#8212; wherefore?&#8217;</p>
<p>
&#8216;That is what <i>I </i>ask. I only suggest that if anyone
steals the papers I should like some good strong, brave men to rob them
back again. You see they are vitally important, and Mahbub Ali he did
not know where you were.&#8217;</p>
<p>

&#8216;Mahbub Ali to rob the Sahiba&#8217;s house? Thou art mad, Babu,&#8217; said Kim
with indignation.</p>
<p>
&#8216;I wanted the papers. Suppose she had stole them. It was only practical
suggestion,
<i>I </i>think. You are not pleased, eh?&#8217;</p>
<p>
A native proverb &#8212; unquotable &#8212; showed the blackness of Kim&#8217;s
disapproval.</p>
<p>

&#8216;Well,&#8217;&#8212;Hurree shrugged his shoulders,&#8212;&#8217; there is no accounting for
thee taste. Mahbub was angry too. He has sold horses all about here,
and he says old lady is
<i>pukka </i>(thorough) old lady and would not
condescend to such ungentlemanly things. <i>I </i>do not
care. I have got the papers, and I was very glad of moral support from
Mahbub. I tell you I am fearful man, and, somehow or other, the more
fearful I am the more damn-tight places I get into. So I was glad you
came with me to Chini, and I am glad Mahbub was close by. The old lady
she is sometimes very rude to me and my beautiful pills.&#8217; &nbsp;</p>
<p>

&#8216;Allah be merciful,&#8217; said Kim on his elbow, rejoicing. &#8216;What a beast of
wonder is a Babu! And that man walked alone &#8212; if he did walk &#8212; with
robbed and angry foreigners.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Oah, that was nothing after they had done beating me, but if I lost
the papers it was pretty jolly serious. Mahbub he nearly beat me too,
and he went and consorted with the lama no end. I shall keep to
ethnological investigations henceforwards. Now good-bye, Mister O&#8217;Hara.
I can catch 4.25 P.M. to Umballa if I am quick. It will be good times
when we all tell thee tale up at Mister Lurgan&#8217;s. I shall report you
offeecially better. Good-bye, my dear fallow, and when next you are
under the emotions please do not use the Mohammedan terms with the
Tibet dress.&#8217;</p>
<p>
He shook hands twice &#8212; a Babu to his boot heels &#8212; and opened the door.
With the fall of the sunlight upon his still triumphant face he
returned to the humble Dacca quack.</p>
<p>
&#8216;He robbed them,&#8217; thought Kim, forgetting his own share in the game.
&#8216;He tricked them. He lied to them like a Bengali. They give him a <i>chit
</i>(a testimonial). He makes them a mock at the risk of
his life &#8212; <i>I </i>never would have gone down to them
after the pistol-shots &#8212; and he says he is a fearful man. . . And he <i>is
</i>a fearful man. I must get into the world
again.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
At first his legs bent like bad pipe-stems, and the flood and rush of
the sunlit air dazzled him. He squatted by the white wall, the mind
rummaging among the incidents of the long <i>dooli </i>journey,
the lama&#8217;s weaknesses, and now that the stimulus of talk was removed,
his own great self-pity, of which, like the sick, he had great store.
The unnerved brain edged away from all the outside, as a raw horse,
once rowelled, sidles from the spur. It was enough, amply enough, that
the spoil of the <i>kilta </i>was away &#8212; off his hands &#8212;
out of his possession. He tried to think of the lama, &#8212; to wonder why
he had tumbled into a brook, &#8212; but the bigness of the world, seen
between the forecourt gates, swept linked thought aside. Then he looked
upon the trees and the broad fields, with the thatched huts hidden
among crops &#8212; looked with strange eyes unable to take up the size and
proportion and use of things &#8212; stared for a still half-hour. All that
while he felt, though he could not put it into words, that his soul was
out of gear with its surroundings &#8212; a cog-wheel unconnected with any
machinery, just like the idle cog-wheel of a cheap Beheea sugar-crusher
laid by in a corner. The breezes fanned over him, the parrots shrieked
at him, the noises of the populated house behind &#8212; squabbles, orders,
and reproofs &#8212; hit on dead ears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

&#8216;I am Kim. I am Kim; and what is Kim?&#8217; His soul repeated it again and
again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
He did not want to cry, &#8212; had never felt less like crying in his life,
&#8212; but of a sudden easy, stupid tears trickled down his nose, and with
almost an audible click he felt the wheels of his being lock up anew on
the world without. Things that rode meaningless on his eyeball an
instant before slid into proper proportion. Roads were meant to be
walked upon, houses to be lived in, cattle to be driven, fields to be
tilled, and men and women to be talked to. They were all real and true
&#8212; solidly planted upon the feet &#8212; perfectly comprehensible &#8212; clay of
his clay, neither more nor less. He shook himself like a dog with a
flea in his ear, and rambled out of the gate. Said the Sahiba, to whom
watchful eyes reported this move: &#8216;Let him go. I have done my share.
Mother Earth must do the rest. When the Holy One comes back from
meditation, tell him.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
There stood an empty bullock-cart on a little knoll half a mile away,
with a young banian tree behind &#8212;a look-out, as it were, above some
new-ploughed levels; and his eyelids, bathed in soft air, grew heavy as
he neared it. The ground was good clean dust &#8212; no new herbage that,
living, is half-way to death already, but the hopeful dust that holds
the seed of all life. Kim felt it between his toes, patted it with his
palms, and, joint by joint, sighing luxuriously, laid him down full
length along in the shadow of the wooden-pinned cart. And Mother Earth
was as faithful as the Sahiba. She breathed through him to restore the
poise he had lost lying so long on a cot cut off from her good
currents. His head lay powerless upon her breast, and his opened hands
surrendered to her strength. The races who shoe their feet with iron
and the skins of dead animals, who pack boards and concrete between
themselves and the clay of their fashioning, do not understand, except
when they go camping, how Earth, that gives all the fevers, can also
take them away. The many-rooted tree above him, and even the dead
man-handled wood beside him, knew what he sought, as he himself did not
know. Hour upon hour he lay deeper than sleep. Towards evening, when
the dust of returning kine made all the horizons smoke, came the lama
and Mahbub Ali, both afoot, walking cautiously, for the house had told
them where he had gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

&#8216;Allah! What a fool&#8217;s trick to play in open country,&#8217; muttered the
horse-dealer. &#8216;He could be shot a hundred times &#8212; but this is not the
Border.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;And,&#8217; said the lama, repeating a many-times-told tale, &#8216;never was such
a <i>
chela. </i>Temperate, kindly, wise, of ungrudging disposition, a
merry heart upon the road, never forgetting, learned, truthful,
courteous. Great is his reward!&#8217;</p>
<p>
&#8216;I know the boy &#8212; as I have said.&#8217;</p>
<p>
&#8216;And he was all those things?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Some of them &#8212; but I have not yet found a Red Hat&#8217;s charm for making
him overly truthful. He has certainly been well nursed.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;The Sahiba is a heart of gold,&#8217; said the lama earnestly. &#8216;She looks
upon him as her son.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

&#8216;Hmph! Half Hind seems that way disposed. I only wished to see that the
boy had come to no harm and was a free agent. As thou knowest, he and I
were old friends in the first days of your pilgrimage
together.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;That is a bond between us.&#8217; The lama sat down. &#8216;We are at the end of
the pilgrimage.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;No thanks to thee thine was not cut off for good and all a week back.
I heard what the Sahiba said to thee when we bore thee up on the cot.&#8217;
Mahbub laughed, and tugged his newly-dyed beard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;I was meditating upon other matters that tide. It was the <i>hakim
</i>from Dacca broke&nbsp;my meditations.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

&#8216;Otherwise &#8216;&#8212; this was in Pashtu for decency&#8217;s sake &#8212; &#8216;thou wouldst
have ended thy meditations upon the sultry side of Hell being an
unbeliever and an idolater for all thy child&#8217;s simplicity. But now, Red
Hat, what is to be done?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;This very night,&#8217; &#8212; the words came slowly, vibrating with triumph, &#8212;
&#8216;this very night he will be as free as I am from all taint of sin &#8212;
assured as I am when he quits this body of Freedom from the Wheel of
Things. I have a sign,&#8217; he laid his hand above the torn chart in his
bosom, &#8216;that my time is short; but I shall have safe-guarded him
throughout the years. Remember, I have reached Knowledge, as I told
thee only three nights back.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;It must be true, as the Tirah priest said when I stole his cousin&#8217;s
wife, that I am a <i>sufi </i>(a freethinker); for here I
sit,&#8217; said Mahbub to himself, &#8216;drinking in blasphemy unthinkable. I
remember the tale. On that, then, he goes to <i>Jannatu l&#8217; Adn </i>(the
Gardens of Eden). . . . Wilt thou slay him or drown him in that
wonderful River from which the Babu dragged thee?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;I was dragged from no River,&#8217; said the lama simply. &#8216;Thou hast
forgotten what befell. I found it by Knowledge.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Oh, ay. True,&#8217; stammered Mahbub, divided between high indignation and
enormous mirth. &#8216;I had forgotten the true run of what happened. Thou
didst find it knowingly.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;And to say that I would take life is &#8212; not a sin, but a madness
simple. My <i>chela </i>aided me to the River. It is his
right to be cleansed from sin &#8212;with me.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Ay, he needs cleansing &#8212; but afterwards, old man &#8212;
afterwards?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;What matter under all the heavens? He is sure of Nibban &#8212; enlightened
&#8212; as I am.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Well said. I had a fear he might mount Mohammed&#8217;s horse and fly
away.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Nay &#8212; he must go forth as a teacher.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Aha! Now I see! That is the right gait for the colt. Certainly he must
go forth as a teacher. He is somewhat urgently needed as a scribe by
the State, for instance.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;To that end he was prepared. I acquired merit in that I gave alms for
his sake. A good deed does not die. He aided me in my Search. I aided
him in his. Just is the Wheel, O horse-seller from the North. Let him
be a teacher. Let him be a scribe. What matter? He will have attained
Freedom at the end. The rest is illusion.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;What matter? when I must have him with me beyond Balkh in six months!
I come up with ten lame horses and three strong-backed men &#8212; thanks to
that chicken of a Babu &#8212; to break a sick boy by. force out of an old
harpy&#8217;s house. It seems that I stand by while a young Sahib is hoisted
into Allah knows what of an idolater&#8217;s heaven by means of old Red Hat.
And I am reckoned something of a player of the game myself! But the
madman is fond of the boy; and I must be very reasonably mad
too.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;What is the prayer?&#8217; said the lama, as the rough Pashtu rumbled into
the red beard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;No matter at all; but now I understand that the boy, sure of Paradise,
can yet enter Government service, my mind is easier. I must get to my
horses. It grows dark. Do not wake him. I have no wish to hear him call
thee master.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;But he <i>is </i>my disciple. What else ?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;He has told me.&#8217; Mahbub choked down his touch of spleen and rose
laughing. &#8216;I am not altogether of thy faith, Red Hat &#8212; if so small a
matter concern thee.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;It is nothing,&#8217; said the lama.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;I thought not. Therefore it will not move thee sinless, new-washed and
three parts drowned to boot, when I call thee a good man &#8212; a very good
man. We have talked together some four or five evenings now, and for
all I am a horse-coper I can still, as the saying is, see holiness
beyond the legs of a horse. Yes, can see, too, how our Friend of all
the World put his hand in thine at the first. Use him well, and suffer
him to return to the world as a teacher, when thou hast &#8212; bathed his
legs, if that is the proper medicine for the colt.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Why not follow the Way thyself, and so accompany the boy?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

Mahbub stared stupefied at the magnificent insolence of the demand,
which across the Border he would have paid with more than a blow. Then
the humour of it touched his Mohammedan soul.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

Softly &#8212; softly &#8212; one foot at a time, as the lame gelding went over the
Umballa jumps. I may come to Paradise later &#8212; I have workings that way
&#8212;great motions &#8212; and I owe them to thy simplicity. Thou hast never
lied?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;What need?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;O Allah, hear him! &#8220;What need&#8221; in this Thy world! Nor ever harmed a
man?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Once &#8212; with a pencase &#8212; before I was wise.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

&#8216;Good! I think the better of thee. Thy teachings are good. Thou hast
turned one man that I know from the path of strife.&#8217; He laughed
immensely. &#8216;He came here open-minded to commit a <i>dacoity </i>(a
house-robbery with violence). Yes, to cut, rob, kill, and carry off
what he desired.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;A great foolishness!&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Oh! black shame too. So he thought after he had seen thee &#8212; and a few
others, male and female. So he abandoned it; and now he goes to beat a
big black man.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;I do not understand.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

&#8216;Allah forbid it! Some men are strong in knowledge, Red Hat. Thy
strength is stronger still.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Keep it &#8212; I think thou wilt.
If the boy is not a good servant, pull his ears off.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
With a hitch of his broad Bokliariot belt the Pathan swaggered off into
the gloaming, and the lama came down from his clouds so far as to look
at the broad back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;That person lacks courtesy, and is deceived by the shadow of
appearances. But he spoke well of my <i>chela, </i>who
now enters upon his reward. Let me make the prayer! . . . Wake, O
fortunate above all born of women. Wake! It is found!&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Kim came up from those deep wells of sleep, and the lama attended his
yawning pleasure; duly snapping fingers to head off evil
spirits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;I have slept a hundred years. Where 
&#8212;? Holy
One, hast <i>thou </i>been here long? I went out to look
for thee, but&#8217; &#8212; he laughed
drowsily &#8212; &#8216;I slept by the way. I am all well now. Hast thou eaten? Let
us go to the house. It is many days since I tended thee. And the Sahiba
fed thee well? Who shampooed thy legs? What of the weaknesses? The
belly and the neck, and the beating in the ears?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Gone &#8212; all gone. Dost thou not know?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;I know nothing, but that I have not seen thee for a monkey&#8217;s age. Know
what?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

&#8216;Strange the knowledge did not reach out to thee, when all my thoughts
were theeward.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;I cannot see the face, but the voice is like a gong. Has the Sahiba
made a young man of thee by her cookery?&#8217;<span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
He peered at the cross-legged figure, outlined jet-black against the
lemon-coloured drift of light. So does the stone Bodhisat sit who looks
down upon the patent self-registering turnstiles of the Lahore
Museum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The lama held his peace. Except for the click of the rosary and a faint
<i>clop-clop
</i>of Mahbub&#8217;s retreating feet, the soft, smoky silence of
evening in India wrapped them close.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Hear me! I bring news.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;But let us &#8212;&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Out shot the long yellow hand compelling silence. Kim tucked his feet
under his robe-edge obediently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Hear me! I bring news! The Search is finished. Comes now the Reward. .
. . Thus. When we were among the hills, I lived on thy strength till
the young branch bowed and nigh broke. When we came out of the hills, I
was troubled for thee and for other matters which I held in my heart.
The boat of my soul lacked direction; I could not see into the Cause of
Things. So I gave thee over to the virtuous woman altogether. I took no
food. I drank no water. Still I saw not the Way. They pressed food upon
me and cried at my shut door. So I removed myself to a hollow under a
tree. I took no food. I took no
water. I sat in meditation two days and two nights, abstracting my
mind; inbreathing and outbreathing in the required manner. . . Upon the
second night &#8212; so great was my reward &#8212; the wise soul loosed itself
from the silly body and went free. This I have never before attained,
though I have stood on the threshold of it. Consider, for it is a
marvel!&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;A marvel indeed. Two days and two nights without food! Where was the
Sahiba?&#8217; said Kim under his breath.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Yea, my soul went free, and, wheeling like an eagle, saw indeed that
there was no Teshoo Lama nor any other soul. As a drop falls into
water, so my soul drew near to the Great Soul which is beyond all
things. At that point, exalted in contemplation, I saw all Hind, from
Ceylon in the sea to the Hills, and my own painted rocks at Suchzen; I
saw every camp and village, to the least, where we have ever rested. I
saw them at one time and in one place; for they were within my soul. By
this I knew the soul had passed beyond the illusion of Time and Space
and of Things. By this I knew that I was free. I saw thee lying in thy
cot, and I saw thee falling down hill under the idolater &#8212; at one time,
in one place, in my soul, which, as I say, had touched the Great Soul.
Also I saw the stupid body of Teshöo Lama lying down, and the <i>hakim
</i>from Dacca kneeled beside, shouting in its ear. Then my
soul was all
alone, and I saw nothing, for I was all things, having reached the
Great Soul. And I meditated a thousand thousand years, passionless,
well aware of the Causes of all Things. Then a voice cried: &#8220;What shall
come to the boy if thou art dead?&#8221; and I was shaken back and forth in
myself with pity for thee; and I said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8220;I will return to my <i>chela </i>lest he miss the Way.&#8221;
Upon this my soul, which is the soul of Teshoo Lama, withdrew itself
from the Great Soul with strivings and yearnings and retchings and
agonies not to be told. As the egg from the fish, as the fish from the
water, as the water from the cloud, as the cloud from the thick air; so
put forth, so leaped out, so drew away, so fumed up the soul of Teshoo
Lama from the Great Soul. Then a voice cried: &#8220;The River! Take heed to
the River!&#8221; and I looked down upon all the world, which was as I have
seen it before &#8212; one in time, one in place &#8212; and I said: &#8220;Yonder is the
River of the Arrow at my feet.&#8221; At that hour my soul was hampered by
some evil or other whereof I was not wholly cleansed, and it lay upon
my arms and coiled round my waist; but I put it aside, and I cast forth
as an eagle in my flight for the very place of the River. I pushed
aside world upon world for thy sake. I saw the River below me &#8212; the
River of the Arrow &#8212; and, descending, the waters of it closed over me;
and behold I was again in the body of Teshoo Lama, but free from sin,
and the <i>hakim </i>from Dacca bore up my head in the
waters of the River. It is behind the mango-tope here &#8212; even
here!&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

&#8216;Allah Kerim! Oh, well that the Babu was there! Wast thou very
wet?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;Why should I regard? I remember the <i>hakim </i>was
concerned for the body of Teshoo Lama. He haled it out of the holy
water in his hands, and there came afterwards a horse-seller from the
North with a cot and men, and they put the body on the cot and bore it
up to the Sahiba&#8217;s house.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;What said the Sahiba?&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&#8216;I was meditating in that body, and did not hear. So thus the Search is
ended. For the merit that I have acquired, the River of the Arrow is
here. It broke forth at our feet, as I have said. I have found it. Son
of my soul, I have wrenched my soul back from the Threshold of Freedom
to free thee from all sin &#8212; as I am free, and sinless. Just is the
Wheel! Certain is our deliverance. Come!&#8217;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
He crossed his hands on his lap and smiled, as a man may who has won
Salvation for himself and his beloved.</p>
