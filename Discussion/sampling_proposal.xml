                <head>Task</head>
                <p>The task for WG1 is to develop guidelines for data and metadata for the creation
                    of the ELTeC. This task can be split up into several distinct tasks: Guidelines
                    for corpus design, basic annotation and metadata schemes and workflow. This
                    discussion paper focuses on corpus design and metadata because both tasks
                    interplay with each other.</p>
                <p>The CA16204 has the goal to create a big benchmark corpus of literature from
                    1850-1920 (first period) for different computational distant reading methods for
                    corpus annotation and analysis. The task of creating annotation guidelines of
                    WG1 needs to be closely communicated and coordinated with WG2 in order to know
                    which methods and tools needs which kind(s) of annotation model and format. The
                    same holds for the development of the metadata scheme. </p>
                <p>For creating such a benchmark corpus, we need a corpus design which allows for a
                    comparability of texts and individual sub-collections according to different
                    metadata set(s). It should be possible for every COST Action member to sample
                    sub-collections from the ELTeC for specific tasks and research questions. In a
                    first step, we focus on the development of clear, operationalized, transparent
                    and motivated selection criteria for the corpus.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Method</head>
                <p>First, we would like to discuss whether the task of corpus building requires
                    normative selection criteria (canon) or methodical selection criteria (corpus
                    sampling). The first and foremost important difference between the approaches is
                    the motivation of criteria. A canon is the portrait of someone’s prestigious
                    social, cultural, economic status and it reflects a normative self-promotional
                    legitimating and rating decisions. In contrast, corpus design follows a research
                    question or context and is therefore more research goal oriented. A second
                    important aspect is the way of considering the actual texts. As Moisl (2009:
                    876) puts it ‘Data is ontologically different from the world.’ So there is a
                    difference between texts in the world and data we create. By texts, we may
                    consider the manifestation or the extension or the work of a text (cf. IFLA
                    2009). A canon can contain an extension of a certain text which is available in
                    different languages and prints. Ontologically, these different levels of text
                    are different to what a text in a corpus might be (cf. van Zundert and Andrews
                    2017). This means, that digitization is a kind of annotation, hence
                    interpretation (Odebrecht et al 2017). A representation of a text in a corpus
                    (e.g. transcriptions, OCR) is the result of interpretation. A corpus design
                    needs to consider this for sampling and digitization issues. </p>
                <p>At the end of the Action, ELTeC should contain literary texts (novels) from a
                    distinct period and from several languages. For each language (and thus for each
                    cultural contexts) there exists a diversity of canons which reflect different
                    prestigious groups such as publishers, authors and readers. These actors and
                    there possible influence on canon building is multi-relational. Each canon is a
                    result of rating texts from different perspectives. The rating can reflect
                    intellectual rating (a text is a representative of a certain literature period,
                    is influencing, is important), by economical rating (a text is published in more
                    than one print run), or by readers rating (a text is most popular by a certain
                    reader group) (cf. Hermann 2011 or Winko 1996). All these ratings can change
                    over time and may also interplay which each other. A canon can therefore reflect
                    different interpretation of ‘famous’, ‘important’ or ‘influential’ texts. These
                    criteria are not overall comparable. For example, texts from a smaller language
                    such as Czech are less likely to be highly reprinted in a way English texts from
                    the same period and genre are. Additionally, the awareness level of texts
                    depends on the influence of the country and their publishing houses.</p>
                <p>The criteria derived from a canon are not completely comparable and categorical.
                    Which prestigious group’s canon shall be considered which shall be excluded and
                    why? Are their comparable canons for novels in all countries of the language in
                    question? Algee-Hewitt and McGurl (2015) show an approach of a corpus design
                    based on several canons and which kind of problems occur. Each analysis of the
                    corpus than only shows the different effects of the decisions made by the
                    normative group. Considering national canons is also very difficult and somewhat
                    problematic. An example is the German National Canon of literature which was
                    developed in the 18 <hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century and was promoted by
                    the national educational system until the 1990. After the German reunification,
                    the educational system does not promote a strict canon and does not recommend a
                    list of book to be read in school or at university (cf. Winko 1996). Thus,
                    taking such types of canons as part of a sampling base of ELTeC would mean to
                    reflect a political and social past of German education and politics. Choosing
                    between canons can then mean choosing between tastes of (current) literature (in
                    past and present) and tastes of past literature when the canon builder rates
                    historical texts. Finally, these canons are not built to be the sampling
                    guidelines for a corpus which we would like to build in the Action.</p>
                <p>The MoU of CA16204 formulates the goal as follows: “The main aim and objective of
                    the Action is to This Action will develop the resources and methods necessary to
                    change the way European literary history is written.” This goal requires a new
                    approach of corpus design, metadata design and annotation models. As Fowler
                    (2002, 214) puts it: ‘The current canon sets limits to our understanding of
                    literature, in several ways’. Relying on canons will oppose to the Action’s goal
                    in a fundamental way. Canons provide traditional and normative access to the
                    history of literature. In contrast, the Action focuses on new approaches to tell
                    another story. Instead, we might decide that our collection should contain a
                    mixture of works that have never been reprinted since their first appearance,
                    works that have been reprinted a small number of times within one or two decades
                    of their first appearance, and works that have been reprinted in almost every
                    decade since their first appearance. </p>
                <p>Therefore, we argue for a non-normative but metadata-based approach of sampling
                    criteria which will follow a corpus design approach. Corpus sampling criteria
                    are mostly oriented/developed by the research question or/and contexts of the
                    corpus creators group. In CA16204, we have neither a distinct research question
                    nor a fixed and previously known corpus creator group. The research context of
                    the Action is more interested in knowledge production in a methodological sense
                    and does not prefer a single method, model or theory. Furthermore, the member
                    group of the Action will fluctuate and consist of researches from different
                    disciplines with different theoretical and cultural contexts. Thus, we need to
                    build the corpus design on a methodical basis. With this method, we will also be
                    able to select canonical texts as well but not exclusively. </p>

            <div>
                <head>Representativeness and balance</head>
                <p>Additional to the aspect of ‘prestige’ (canon), the aspect of representativeness
                    is problematic for corpus design. Developing criteria for corpus design means to
                    decide which kind of sample of the world shall be included in the data base.
                    Obviously, including the whole population of literature of the 19<hi
                        rend="superscript">th</hi> century of several languages is impossible. So we
                    need to make a compromise between what we would like to have in the corpus (all
                    literature) and what we can put in the corpus (sample). </p>
                <p>It is a truism that there is no such thing as a ‘good’ or a ‘bad’ corpus, because
                    how a corpus is designed depends on what kind of corpus it is and how it is
                    going to be used. (Hunston 2008, 155)</p>
                <p>Following Hunston (2008), a corpus design needs to follow the research goal. For
                    the Action, representativeness may be the relationship between the corpus and
                    the body of literature in question. ‘Representativeness refers to the extent to
                    which a sample includes the full range of variability in a population’ (Biber
                    1993, 243). To say something about the representativeness of a corpus requires
                    knowledge about the whole population of literature (in the period in question).
                    Actually, we don’t know every book of every language published/read/discussed in
                    Europe in the period in question. It is further ‘impossible to identify a
                    complete list of ‘categories’ that would exhaustively account for all texts
                    produced in a given language’, (Hunston 2008, 161) or context. Such categories
                    can refer to various factors such as characteristics of authors, e.g., gender or
                    place of birth, publishers, topics of the texts, readership etc. Against the
                    background of canon building, there is also ‘no true measure of the
                    ‘significance’ of a type of discourse to a community’. The chance, that a corpus
                    represents the whole population of something increases with the size of a
                    corpus. In this way, size and representativeness are connected. <note
                        place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p rend="footnote text"> See Biber (1993)
                            and Hunston (2008) for a detailed discussion.</p></note>
                    Representativeness is therefore a kind of ideal which we would like to pursuit
                    but which cannot not achieved as whole. In line with the MoU, the ELTeC can be
                    designed as a monitor corpus where texts (from different languages and periods)
                    can be added over time. </p>
                <p>Balance refers to the internal proportion of the corpus. Note that a fully
                    balanced corpus is an ideal which we only can try to achieve next to the ideal
                    of representativeness (Hunston 2008, 163). According the MoU, the corpus shall
                    contain 2,500 full-texts novels at least in 10 different languages:</p>
                <list type="unordered">
                    <item>Languages: Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Polish,
                        Portuguese, Russian, Spanish (ELTeC core)</item>
                    <item>first iteration: 6 subcollections (100 novels per language) 1850 to 1920
                        starting with British, French, Spanish, German, Greek, Polish</item>
                    <item>second iteration: 4 subcollections (100 novels per language) 1850 to

                    <item>third iteration: 6 subcollections in additional languages and
                        subcollections for all 16 languages 1780-1850, </item>
                </list>
                <p>In this way, ELTeC is balanced with respect to language. With respect to genre,
                    the corpus is not balanced but homogenous; all texts in the corpus shall be full
                    novels. With respect to time, the corpus design shall focus on the period 1850
                    to 1920.</p>
                <p>Before discussing the criteria in more detail, we would like to ask another
                    methodical question concerning corpus sampling: Do we would like to use each
                    criterion, with the intention to represent the variety of possible values, or
                    should the sample represent the distribution of those values across the
                    population? </p>
                <p>Let’s say we wish to select 100 texts from a population of texts published over a
                    period of (say) 20 decades. We might select five texts from the first decade,
                    five from the second, and so on, making up our 100 titles, evenly spread across
                    the possible decades. The probability that a text in our corpus will come from
                    any given decade will always be the same: 1 in 5. This selection represents the
                        <emph>variety</emph> of possible values for the criterion. Suppose now that
                    we look more closely at the number of titles from each decade actually available
                    in the population we are sampling. It’s more than likely that this number will
                    vary significantly: for example, we might notice that there are 2000 titles
                    published in decade x, and only 100 in decade y. To represent this population
                        <emph>statistically </emph>we should therefore make it 20 times more
                    probable that a randomly chosen title will come from decade x than from decade
                    y. Since the total number of titles we can choose is quite small relative to the
                    total number available in the population, strict application of this principle
                    may mean that we cannot choose any titles at all from some decades. This is one
                    reason for preferring to make our sampling represent variety rather than
                    frequency; another is that we cannot choose fractional numbers of titles. When
                    we start considering more than one criterion, the task of ensuring that the
                    numbers in our sample accurately reflect the distribution of all values across
                    the population becomes prohibitively complex. </p>
                <p>Following the approach of representing the variety of a population, we then need
                    to decide which criterion is balanced in which way and interplays with other
                    criteria. For example, we may want to choose novels from male and female authors
                    in a balanced way. This may mean that in the total of all novels one half will
                    be from female authors. Without any further regulation, we might have more
                    female authors in one decade than in other decades. If we would like to have an
                    equal number of male and female authors in every decade, we need to link the
                    criterion of the author’s gender with the criterion of time. Doing this, might
                    complicate selecting novels (cf. finding novels for this proportion in every
                    decade of the period in question). So we have to decide which categories shall
                    be present in a balanced way in the corpus. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Requirements of sampling criteria</head>
                <p>According to the MoU, the corpus design should be balanced with respect to
                    language and publication date of the texts. This means not that the corpus
                    should be solely based on chronological criteria, meaning that we need a text
                    from each year of the period in question. The main sampling criterion ‘language’
                    will require not to including translations at all. We will then take the first
                    edition of a novel. By a novel, we mean the first edition of the book, hence
                    excluding novels only printed in journals. Considering only the first editions
                    has two advantages: the first edition should be free in most of the cases,
                    meaning they carry no copy right. Later editions and reprint may have such
                    restrictions. The first edition is more interesting from a philological point of
                    view. It represents the authentic texts of the authors. Dealing with historical
                    texts requires then some cleaning up and normalizations (we need to discuss
                    these steps later on). </p>
                <p> The electronically availability should not be a leading sampling criterion. But,
                    availability is a limiting factor. A text should not be excluded from ELTeC
                    because it is not digitized, but it should be excluded if the text cannot be
                    made freely available in ELTeC. If we only use availability as a selecting
                    criterion, we are at risk of copying projects such as ‘Gutenberg’ for example.
                    We then need additional criteria which can be applied without having to know
                    (read) the texts in question. The criteria should be checked without a deep
                    knowledge about the texts. Otherwise, this will oppose the goal of the whole
                    Action and the methodical approach of distant reading. The criteria should be
                    operationalizable, meaning decidable from text metadata. Here, we define text
                    metadata in a wider scope than only the classical bibliographical metadata. In
                    this way corpus design interacts with metadata. Some of the text’s metadata can
                    be used a sampling criteria. These criteria are text-external and -internal
                    criteria (cf. Hunston 2008) on which we then need to rely on. </p>
