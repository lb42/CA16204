      <body>
         <p>This is the first draft of a reference document defining the encoding scheme to be used
            for the European Literary Text Collection (ELTeC) which will be a major deliverable of
            COST Action 16204, <title>Distant Reading</title>. As a first draft it necessarily
            contains much uncertainty, either because policies have to be determined, or because
            issues are under-specified. This version represents the views of its author only.
            Particular topics on which policy remains to be defined are signalled below with the
            label <q>Open Question</q>. </p>
         <div>
            <head>Principles</head>
            <p>The MoU for the project points out that <q>Distant Reading methods cover a wide range
                  of computational methods for literary text analysis, such as authorship
                  attribution, topic modelling, character network analysis, or stylistic
                  analysis.</q> The focus of the ELTeC encoding scheme is thus not to represent
               texts in all their original complexity of structure or appearance, but rather to
               facilitate a richer and better-informed distant reading than a transcription of its
               lexical content alone would permit. For example, it seems useful to distinguish
               headings and annotations from the rest of the text, and to be able to locate
               stretches of text within gross structural features such as chapters and paragraphs.
               It is probably also useful to distinguish passages belonging to different narrative
               levels (for example, direct speech versus narrative or quotation versus narrative)
               and to identify reference points such as page breaks. It is less useful to record
               exact nuances of rendition or spelling in a particular version of a text. Our goal is
               not to duplicate the work of scholarly editors or to produce (yet another) digital
               edition of a specific source document. </p>
            <!-- CO: OK. With respect to the selection criteria, we need to consider that we will encode the first edition of each texts. 
               The first edition will reveal spelling variances and variances concerning different text levels, e.g, direct speech
               (like any other modern edition will do in some way or the other)-->
            <!-- LB : the idea of encoding specifically the first edition wasn't what I thought the
               brief was when I started work on this document! -->
            <p>In selecting features for inclusion in the markup scheme, we have been guided, but
               not limited, by existing practice as far as possible <note place="foot">Particular
                  collections we have examined are listed in section <ptr target="#sources"/></note>
               but the main goal has been to identify a small core set of essential textual features
               which can be readily (preferably automatically) identified in existing digital
               transcriptions, or easily and consistently provided by new transcriptions. </p>
            <!-- BN : I definitely agree:-->
            <p>This document lists all the textual features which are to be distinguished in an
               ELTeC conformant transcription. Whenever a given feature exists in a text, it will be
               marked up as indicated here. No other features will be captured by the markup: if
               some textual feature not provided for here is identified by a marked up source text,
               that markup will be removed. The goal is to ensure that the ELTeC texts can be
               processed by very simple minded (but XML-aware) systems primarily concerned with
               lexis and to make life easier for the developers of such systems. </p>
            <!-- CO: In addition, our scheme should make sure that we have no variance in the actual encoding.
               Especially a fixed sequence of attributes and a fixed hierarchical structure of elements is needed for parsing issues. 
               For example, allowing diverging xpath may reveal problems for automatically processing ELTeC.  -->
            <!-- LB : I am assuming we will produce a tightly constrained XML schema to ensure that
               the hierarchy of XML elements is simple and predictable. We can't however do anything
               to enforce the order in which attributes appear on an XML tag, nor should we. And I
               don't know what you mean by "allowing diverging xpath": we can't control the
               structure of the documents we are encoding, just represent them! My
               assumption is that ELTeC documents will be well formed and valid XML documents: no
               more, but no less. What parsing issues are you imagining? -->
            <!-- CO: For this period, it may not be a frequent problem, but we also need to think of special character encoding:
               a full and extensive transcription guideline is needed. 
               We should further rely on UTF8 encoding. -->
            <!-- LB: Not sure what you mean here. Can you give an example? I am assuming we will use
              Unicode and UTF8. If we need anything beyond that we could use TEI <g> I suppose -->
            <p>We make no attempt to propose markup for linguistic annotations here. The assumption
               is that this will be produced by different annotation systems in different ways,
               though with an association between such annotations and the basic lexical structures
               represented by the core ELTeC markup. </p>
            <!-- CO: These linguistic or any other annotations may be assigned in different formats. Thus, the tei representation serves as a starting point for some other automatic annotations and analysis. I think, -->

            <head>Basic Transcription Guidelines</head>
            <!-- CO: General thoughts: I think, we should have in mind when the encoding can be done automatically and when we need man power for encoding. -->
            <!-- LB : in what way ? this sounds like a workflow issue -->
            <p>The basic unit of the ELTeC corpus is the text of a single novel, represented by a
               TEI <gi>text</gi> element. We propose no mechanism (other than metadata) to encode
               units larger than a single novel, such as multipart novel series like Proust's
                  <title>A la recherche du temps perdu</title> or Balzac's <title>Les
                  Rougon-Macquart</title>. </p>
            <p><label>Open Question</label> Should we include liminal matter (titlepages, prefaces,
               appendixes...) in our transcriptions? The following policies seem possible: <list>
                  <item>No : these typically belong to a particular edition or version of the text,
                     and should therefore systematically be excluded</item>
                  <item>Yes : these often form a significant part of the reader's experience (cf.
                     the foreword to most editions of <title>David Copperfield</title>). Mark them
                     up using <gi>front</gi> and <gi>back</gi> as appropriate.</item>
                  <!-- CO: As we would like to propose the use of first editions, we represent the
                     original version. Additionally, I know studies where these non-continuous texts 
                     are analyzed to investigate and question traditional classifications of text genres.  
                  -->
                  <!-- LB : what do you mean by "non-continuous"? -->
                  <!-- BN: From my point of view, liminal matter should not be included in the
               transcription. I think this information is related to the book as physical object,
               but the project is focused on the novel, on the content of the book. At least at the
               moment I think this information is not useful for a distant reading. -->
                  <item>Sort of : do not transcribe them, but indicate that they have been
                     suppressed by using the <gi>gap</gi> element. </item>
               </list></p>
            <p>Within the body of a text, major structural divisions (parts, sections, chapters
               etc.) will be captured using the generic <gi>div</gi> element, with attributes
                  <att>type</att>, <att>xml:lang</att>, <att>xml:id</att> and <att>n</att> used as
               further detailed below.</p>
            <p>The names used for hierarchic structural divisions of a novel above the chapter are
               arbitrary, culture-specific, and often inconsistent : in some novels things called
                  <q>part</q> contain things called <q>book</q> and in others the reverse. We
               propose to follow TEI in using a single element (<gi>div</gi>) for every hierarchical
               structural division, down to the level of <q>chapter</q>.</p>
            <p><label>Open Question</label> Is it useful to retain the name used for each level in
               the original source (the type of div) ? <list>
                  <!-- CO: Maybe I just missed this information. We can keep the structuring texts/words of the text as headings.
                     We can mark them with the appropriate element. In this way, we can keep the information without having to define 
                     a fixed list of subdivisions in a novel (you alreay pointed out that this is not possible). Having marked the existing 
                     headings (and subheadings) they can be included or ignored automatically when processing the document.  -->
                  <!-- LB : I think it would be problematic to just use <head> without using <div>
                     if that's what you are suggesting. I am only asking whether or not we
                     include e.g. @type="chapter" on the top level div -->
                  <!-- BN: I'm not sure. Maybe it could be a good solution the third one:-->
                  <item> Yes: it is easy to keep and may help referencing : use the <att>type</att>
                     attribute to hold the name used for each level of div in the work in
                     question</item>
                  <item>No : this name adds no useful information beyond the level indicated by the
                     XML structure </item>
                  <item>No : it would be more useful to provide an explicit and normalised
                     indication of the hierarchic level for the benefit of non-XML-aware processors
                     (e.g. <code>level1</code>, <code>level2</code> etc.)</item>
               </list></p>
            <p>The (human) language in which a text is expressed is indicated explicitly by the
                  <att>xml:lang</att> attribute which supplies the ISO 2 letter code for the
               language concerned. This attribute will always be supplied on the <gi>text</gi>
               element to specify a default, and may also appear on other elements, for example
                  <gi>foreign</gi>, to indicate passages where the language changes. The various
               different languages used in a given text will be itemized in its metadata (see
                  <gi>langUsage</gi> element in the header). </p>
            <p><label>Open question</label> Should passages exhibiting regional or dialectal
               variation be specially signalled? <list>
                  <item>No : this is too fine grained and controversial a distinction to be made
                     with reliable consistency </item>
                  <item>Yes : treat this in the same way as any other kind of code switching and
                     define a set of appropriate language codes for the project</item>
                  <!-- CO: From a linguistic point of view, I would like to say yes but detecting dialectal variation 
                     is something which cannot be done automatically. I think, without a more explicit guidelines concerning 
                     the detection of foreign material we might end up with confusing analysis. The definition of the elemetn foreing is broad. For example,
                     neoclassic words may or may not count as foreign. Especially in a corpus containing roman and germanic languages.  -->
                  <!-- BN: This annotation could be complex. I think it will be better to annotate
dialectal variations during linguistic annotation.-->
                  <!-- LB : maybe we should just use foreign for passages which are signalled
                     specially in some way in the text. e.g. in italics -->
                  <item>Maybe : just use the <gi>distinct</gi> element to indicate the kind of
                     variation concerned</item>
                  <!-- CO: This element may then be applied to other distinct phenomena as well. I
               think this is not the best way. -->
                  <!-- LB: Many TEI elements have multiple uses, so this is not an argument against using
                  <distinct> in my view-->
               </list></p>
            <p>A single reference scheme will be defined for the whole corpus, with the following
               components: <list>
                  <item>text identifier : every text will have an identifier consisting of its two
                     letter language code and a three digit serial number, for example
                        <code>FR042</code></item>
                  <item>chapter identifier: each chapter or equivalent will have an identifier
                     concatenating the text identifier and a three digit serial number, for example
                        <code>FR042012</code> is the twelfth chapter of the 42nd French novel. </item>
                  <item>If sub-chapter segmentation (see below) is implemented, then the segments
                     will append a further four digit serial number.</item>
                  <!--  CO: In addition, each other part of the book may also get an identifier too (table of contents etc.).  
               -->
                  <!-- LB: assuming that they are included, yes, they will. Do we really want to
                     include tables of contents? -->
               </list>The identifier will be supplied as the value of an <att>xml:id</att> attribute
               on each <gi>text</gi>, <gi>div</gi> or <gi>s</gi> element as appropriate. Adding this
               identifier is an easily automated task which can be built into the workflow for
               accession to the ELTeC.</p>
            <p>Note that these identifiers will not necessarily correspond with the numbering used
               in a particular source text. In a work where the first twelve chapters are considered
               to form part one, and the next twelve constitute part two, the first chapter of the
               second part will have an identifier ending <code>013</code>, even though it may be
               numbered <code>1</code> in a source text. </p>
            <!-- CO: good idea. -->
            <p><label>Open question</label> is it important to preserve the original numbering,
               particularly for deeply structured texts? <list>
                  <item>Yes : the original numbering is widely used to reference the text: it should
                     be supplied as using the <att>n</att> attribute on the <gi>div</gi>.</item>
                  <!-- CO: we may use here the "head" element as the numbering of a chapter may be analysed as a head, maybe next to other heads. See comment above-->
                  <!-- BN: I'm not sure. Sometimes scholars refer to specific passages by original numbering ("The chapter two of Don Quixote bla bla bla"). In this case
this information is necessary. -->
                  <!-- head is not the same as @n : I agree with Borja -->
                  <item>No : the original numbering and referencing scheme are of no use in our
                     intended applications, introduce unnecessary complexity, and may be a source of
                     confusion. </item>
               </list></p>
            <p>The chapters of a novel mostly consist of prose, arranged in paragraphs, for which we
               will use the TEI <gi>p</gi> element. It is not unusual to find other structures
               however, specifically verse, or passages of dialogue presented as if in a play, with
               speaker labels and even stage directions. Less frequently, novels may contain
               material presented in list or tabular formats. Graphics with their own associated
               heading or other text are also frequent. </p>

               dialogue be encoded? <list type="ordered">

            <p>Novels are also full of direct speech, represented using various different
               conventions, but almost always distinguished from the narrative voice. The first
               person narrative is also common, but may be regarded as a special case.
               <!-- CO: Narrative voice might be good to have for the metadata! -->How exactly
               different narrative strands are articulated in a novel, and the extent to which they
               may be characterised by their lexis has been a preoccupation of many <q>distant
                  reading</q> style analyses. It might therefore be helpful to distinguish material
               purporting to be direct speech from material purporting to be narrative in our basic
               encoding, though to do so consistently and accurately may occasionally be
               problematic.</p>

                  <item>No : rely on (or normalise) typographic conventions such as quote marks or
                     dashes to distinguish direct speech only. </item>
                  <!-- CO: At the moment, I would prefer this solution. -->

            <p>Printed texts typically deploy a number of conventions which can cause problems for
               linguistic analyses of even the most basic kind. Changes of font or style
               (italicization or use of superscript, for example) can have particular lexical
               significance which should be taken into account. End-of-line hyphenation can make it
               harder to identify the exact form of a token. Non-standard (i.e. non-modern)
               spellings can mislead parsers. Our proposed encoding aims above all for consistency
               and transparency in what is reliably achievable, leaving more difficult and
               problematic issues to be addressed by linguistic annotations. </p>
            <p>We do not preserve the lineation of running prose in our source texts, since this is
               always purely an artefact of the source edition. For the same reason we will
               reassemble words broken across a line break, silently removing any hyphen present.
               (This will make it impossible to use our texts for hyphenation studies. So be it.) </p>
            <!-- CO: This contradicts the idea of encoding the first edition in a philological way. -->
            <p><label>Open Question</label> : Should page breaks in the source text be preserved ? <list>
                  <item>Yes : this is useful information (e.g. to determine words-per-page, or to
                     anchor links to an image of the source text) which is usually available at
                     no-cost in existing digital texts</item>
                  <!-- CO: This might help. -->
                  <!-- BN: From my point of view this information is not necessary. As I said
before, it is related to the book as physical object, not to the novel itself.-->
                  <item>No : the proposed uses don't justify the cost of providing the information
                     if it is missing. And pagination is inherently copy-specific.</item>
               </list></p>
            <p>Font and style variations in the source text usually signal something. Italics may
               signal emphasis, quotation, foreign language terms etc. Superscripts almost always
               signal abbreviation. The visual salience of these variations is of considerably less
               interest to distant readers than the intended function they signal. However, it is
               not always easy to determine that function reliably and consistently by algorithm.
               Some simple cases could however be addressed. A possibly strategy is outlined below.
               It assumes the existence of a digital version of the text in which visual features
               are explicit, whether by means of TEI-style markup or styling information such as
               that provided by Word. <list>
                  <item>if possible, replace indications of highlighting by an appropriate TEI
                     element, chosen from the following list : <gi>foreign</gi>, <gi>title</gi>,
                        <gi>emph</gi></item>
                  <!-- CO: Why would title and foreign be good elements for the task?  Emph refers to linguistic or rhetorical effect -->
                  <!-- LB: because titles and foreign passages are often represented by
                     highlighting -->
                  <item>otherwise, replace all indications of highlighting by the TEI <gi>hi</gi>
                     element</item>
                  <!-- CO: this might be a good way of encoding. hi can get a @rend for determing bold, underlined etc.?! -->
                  <!-- LB: indeed it can, but why would we want to use that? -->
                  <item>indications of superscript characters (such as French
                        <soCalled>14&#x1d49;</soCalled>) should be removed. Instead, the TEI element
                        <gi>abbr</gi> should be used to indicate the presence of an abbreviated
                     word: <code>&lt;abbr>14e&lt;/abbr></code></item>
               </list></p>
            <p><label>Open Question</label>: Is it feasible or useful to recode highlighted spans of
               text in this way? <!-- BN: I don't know. I'm not sure if it is worth annotating this information. It
seems that it is not really useful for a distant reading.-->
               <!-- LB : I think I am coming down on Borja's side here: it's a LOT of work to do it
                  properly, and most distant readers won't want to use it -->
               <list>
                  <item>Yes : in many cases this can be an automatic process and the results justify
                     investing the effort </item>
                  <item>No : there are likely to be too many borderline or debatable cases to do
                     this automatically so this would have to be done as part of a major proof

               </list></p>
            <p>Whichever solution is adopted, it should be applied uniformly across the ELTeC. A

               coded values for the descriptive selection criteria associated with the text. As far

            <p>The TEI Header provides a very large number of possibilities for encoding such
               metadata. We will provide a checklist of the TEI Header elements which are always to
               be provided for each text, possibly in the form of a template. As in the body of the
               text, the intention is to provide a guaranteed minimal level of information,
               consistent across all parts of the ELTeC. </p>

                  example, a text which is almost entirely in British English, but also contains
                  some parts in US English would have an entry like this: </p>

                  </langUsage></egXML>
               <p>The TEI <gi>textClass</gi> element can contain one or more of the following
                  elements: <specList>

            <p> Later stages of the project will need to use additional markup facilities to
               represent more sophisticated annotations, which may be motivated linguistically (for
               example, to provide a normalised form, part of speech, etc.) or semantically (for
               example to distinguish proper names, names of people, places, events, etc.). These
               will form an additional layer, not discussed here: the principle should however be
               that the base text we provide is always available in a uniform encoding.</p>
